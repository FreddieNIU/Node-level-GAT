It has amassed assets over $6.27 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, FNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for FNDA are 0.25%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.27%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 19.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, First Solar Inc (FSLR) accounts for about 0.42% of the fund's total assets, followed by Geo Group Reit Inc (GEO) and Valmont Inds Inc (VMI).The top 10 holdings account for about 2.36% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added about 8.22% and is down about -1.40% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 01/26/2023), respectively. FNDA has traded between $42.52 and $54.89 during this last 52-week period.FNDA has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 31.39% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 976 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard SmallCap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index.

You should consider the Schwab U.S. LargeCap Value ETF (SCHV), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/11/2009.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $10.24 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.30%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise.

TI expected sales to repeat their decline across all its major markets, except again for its Automotive business.The analyst believes TI's product, customer, and end market exposure positions the company to weather the current cyclical correction better than most.Also contributing to TI's softer December results and March period outlook is the ongoing inventory correction.BMO Capital analyst Ambrish Srivastava maintained an Outperform and raised the price target from $195 to $215.Top-line guidance was lower than the consensus but higher than the analyst's expectations.

And while Microsoft may be the talk on the Street today, we're taking a look at some of the other biggest movers of the day with Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines, what are you watching?INES FERRE: Well, Rachelle, I'm watching the number two trending ticker on Yahoo Finance behind Microsoft, and that would be Boeing after Boeing reported its quarterly results. Take a look at our YFi Interactive board. That's the Dow, all 30 components of the Dow there.And you can see Boeing one of the biggest laggards on the Dow, down almost 3% after a fourth quarter loss of $1.75 per share, missing estimates, Wall Street estimates of a profit. Its revenue came in at 19.98 billion. That was also a miss. Some commentary from analyst Cowan saying that the results may suggest a broad-based softness in operations. You still, though, have 19 buys and 6 holds, 0 sells on this stock.Another stock that I'm also taking a look at is in the semiconductor space, and that would be Texas Instruments after the company reported its quarterly results. The stock down almost 2%. That's partly because of the biggest sales decline for Texas Instruments since 2020. The company also issued weaker than expected guidance, saying that it's seeing a slowing demand across different industries, except for the auto industry.And Texas Instruments is an important stock to look at and an important company to look at because it has almost 100,000 customers worldwide across different industries. So you can really get a gauge of where we're at with these semiconductors.And then just taking a look at ASML, this is a company that makes-- manufactures equipment for making semiconductors. And it topped its earnings forecast. Its sales grew-- is going to grow in 2023. That is according to their predictions or projections.But it did call out the Chinese controls on exports and that this could impact the company because the chip technology has sort of become a security concern when it comes to China, ASML warning that excessive export controls could inflate chip costs. It could also impact supply chains. Some of the top customers, by the way, for ASML is TSMC and also Samsung and also Intel. So another important company to watch because they make the equipment for making semiconductors. Rachelle.]"

The Company's $1.75 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn and does not expire until November 2026.  Nucor continues to have the strongest credit rating in the North American steel sector with unchanged long-term senior unsecured ratings from Moody's (Baa1) and Standard &amp; Poor's (A-).

The modest decrease in the steel products segment earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 was due to lower volumes and selling prices. Raw materials segment earnings decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 primarily due to decreased profitability at our direct reduced iron, or DRI, facilities, both of which experienced planned outages during the fourth quarter, decreased selling prices for raw materials, and the previously mentioned write-off of the leasehold interest in unproved oil and gas properties.First Quarter of 2023 OutlookThe profitability of the steel mills segment is expected to increase in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher margins and volumes, with the largest improvement expected to occur at our sheet mills.Within the steel products segment, we expect continued strong profitability in the first quarter of 2023, with some decrease expected from the fourth quarter of 2022 due to seasonally slower construction activity and some reductions in realized pricing. Overall, we expect first quarter 2023 steel products segment earnings to be higher than the first quarter of 2022.In the raw materials segment, excluding the impact of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect increased profitability compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher volumes at our DRI facilities and scrap recycling and brokerage operations.On a combined basis, the operating income during the first quarter of 2023 from our three business segments is expected to exceed that of the fourth quarter of 2022. However, we expect consolidated net earnings to decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to intercompany eliminations in the first quarter of 2023 and the absence of state tax benefits that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.Earnings Conference CallAn earnings call is scheduled for January 26, 2023 at 2 pm Eastern Time to review Nucor's fourth-quarter and full year 2022 financial results and business update.

STLD recorded a net income of $635 million or $3.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a decline of 41.8% from the year-ago quarter profit of $1,090.5 million or $5.49 a share.STLD posted adjusted earnings of $4.37 per share, down 24.4% from the year-ago quarter’s $5.78.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSteel Dynamics, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Steel Dynamics, Inc. QuoteSegment HighlightsNet sales for the company’s steel operations were $2,937 million in the fourth quarter, which reflects a decline of 22.4% year over year. The segment’s operating income in the reported quarter was $178.5 million, down roughly 86.9%. STLD’s steel operations suffered from seasonal factors resulting in sequentially lower shipments. Also, higher raw materials costs amplified the metal spread compression in the fourth quarter. The average external product selling price fell 32.4% year over year to $1,124 per ton.Net sales for the company’s Metal’s recycling operations were $463.3 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline of 15.9% from the prior-year quarter. The segment’s operating income was $14.2 million, roughly 67.3% lower year over year. Strong shipment volumes and increased metal margins acted as tailwinds for this segment. However, these were partly offset by lower selling values for ferrous and non-ferrous scraps.The company's steel fabrication operations raked in sales of around $1,090 million, up around 60.3% year over year. The segment posted an operating income of approximately $682 million, up 187%. Stable realized selling values, low steel input costs and steady demand in the non-residential construction market boosted the segment’s performance in the fourth quarter.Story continuesFY22 ResultsAdjusted earnings for full-year 2022 were $22.68 per share compared with $16.09 a year ago. Net sales increased 20.9% year over year to $22,260.8 million.Financial PositionSteel Dynamics ended 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,628.4 million, up 30.9% from the year-ago levels. Long-term debt was $3,013.2 million, essentially flat year over year.The company generated $4.5 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022. It also repurchased $1.8 billion of its common stock during the year.OutlookSteel Dynamics stated that customer order entry activity remains healthy across its businesses. The company believes firm steel pricing and solid order activity will benefit its performance moving ahead. Also, the company anticipates that steel consumption will ramp up in North America in 2023 and steel pricing will be supported by high demand for lower-carbon-free emission steel, high usage of U.S.-produced steel products and lower volumes of imports.Price PerformanceSTLD’s shares are up 103.2% over a year compared with a 25.2% rise recorded by its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksSteel Dynamics currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks to consider in the basic materials space include Nucor Corporation NUE, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM and FMC Corporation FMC.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nucor is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NUE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.32 per share for NUE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.18 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NUE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.29% heading into earnings season.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

20,6122d36c-9ca0-3a52-81be-215ff5d137f4,ARE,2023-01-26,Here's Why Alexandria (ARE) Jumped 13.3% in the Past 3 Months,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-alexandria-jumped-13-135601916.html,1674654961,STORY,['ARE'],"[Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE, presently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), have rallied 13.3% over the past three months, outperforming its industry's growth of 8.7%.This Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT), slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 and full-year results on Jan 30, has a portfolio of high-quality, niche assets — life science, technology and agtech properties — in strategic markets.It has been witnessing healthy demand for its properties amid the growing need for drug research and innovation. Moreover, favorable demand-supply dynamics and the company’s strong pricing power in its core markets give it a competitive edge.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and a limited supply of available spaces.In addition, the life-science industry has been benefiting from the increasing life expectancy of the United States population and biopharma drug development growth opportunities.As a result, higher demand for life science real-estate assets and the advantageous locations of ARE’s properties have been aiding leasing activity and occupancy growth.In third-quarter 2022, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 1.7 million rentable square feet (RSF) of space. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to 1.1 million RSF. The leasing of development and redevelopment space was 0.3 million RSF. Also, it registered rental rate growth of 34.3% (24.2% on a cash basis) during this period.The occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 94.3% as of Sep 30, 2022. The occupancy, excluding the vacancy at the recently acquired properties, was 98.4% as of the same date.ARE has a strong tenant base of more than 1,000 high-quality companies, which ensures steady rental revenues. As of Sep 30, 2022, investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants accounted for 49% of the annual rental revenues in effect. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all the tenants is 7.2 years, and for the company’s top 20 tenants, it is 9.7 years.Alexandria’s acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations to enhance its operating platform have paid off well. In the third quarter of 2022, ARE completed acquisitions in its key life-science cluster submarkets totaling 1.2 million RSF of value-creation opportunities for $316.7 million. It also placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 332,961 RSF across multiple submarkets during the quarter.  ARE has a promising development pipeline. As of Sep 30, 2022, ARE had 5.6 million RSF of the Class A properties undergoing construction. Further, it had 9.9 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects and 17.9 million SF of future development projects.The company’s robust balance-sheet position has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It exited third-quarter 2022 with $6.4 billion of liquidity. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025. Moreover, investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, render the company favorable access to the debt market.The funds from operations (FFO) per share for 2022 are expected to be up 8.38% compared with the industry’s average of 3.76%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $8.41.ARE is known for consistently raising its dividend rates, which remains a huge attraction for REIT investors. In December 2022, it increased its dividend payment from $1.18 per share to $1.21, representing a sequential hike of 2.5%. Alexandria increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 6.07%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Stag Industrial STAG and The Geo Group GEO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ current-year FFO per share is pegged at $2.11.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stag Industrial’s ongoing year’s FFO per share is pegged at $2.25.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Geo Group’s 2022 FFO per share stands at $2.35.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

21,c9b4cb51-8f83-3c27-878f-98ea0c785910,UNM,2023-01-26,Aflac (AFL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-expected-beat-earnings-150003991.html,1674658803,STORY,"['AFL', 'UNM']","[The market expects Aflac (AFL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.49 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.85% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac?For Aflac, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Aflac will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +0.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aflac appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Unum (UNM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +64%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Unum has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

22,1869dcc9-f7d8-37cd-94a4-bd932dd9f6f4,STT,2023-01-26,State Street Corporation (STT) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-corporation-stt-could-164504560.html,1674665104,STORY,['STT'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.State Street Corporation in FocusHeadquartered in Boston, State Street Corporation (STT) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 12.19% so far this year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.63 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.9%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.21% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 5% from last year. In the past five-year period, State Street Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.44%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. State Street Corporation's current payout ratio is 34%, meaning it paid out 34% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, STT expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.44 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 13.90%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that STT is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the same time, the Dow added 0.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.44%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had gained 6.47% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 0.87% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.57% in that time.Thermo Fisher Scientific will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 1, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.19, down 20.64% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $10.36 billion, down 3.22% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.33. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.07, so we one might conclude that Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that TMO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.03. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 105, putting it in the top 42% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.6%.Revenues are expected to be $10.36 billion, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Thermo Fisher?For Thermo Fisher, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.62%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Thermo Fisher will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Thermo Fisher would post earnings of $4.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.08, delivering a surprise of +6.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Thermo Fisher doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Hence, the fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results include one month of results from the buyout.USB’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share (excluding merger and integration-related charges) of $1.20 handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1.11 per share. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.07 per share.Results benefited from an increase in net interest income (NII), which was supported by higher interest rates and loan growth. However, a decline in non-interest income (largely on lower mortgage banking income) and higher expenses were the headwinds. Also, the company’s credit quality deteriorated in the reported quarter.Net income (GAAP basis) was $925 million, down 44.7% from the prior-year quarter.In 2022, earnings per share (excluding notable items) of $4.45 surpassed the consensus estimate of $4.35. Net income (GAAP basis) was $5.83 billion, down 26.6%.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseTotal net revenues in the quarter were $6.37 billion, up 12% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.66 billion.In 2022, total net revenues grew 6.5% to $24.3 billion. The top line, however, lagged the consensus estimate of $24.5 billion.The tax-equivalent NII totaled $4.32 billion, jumping 37.3% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by rising interest rates on earning assets and strong loan growth, partially offset by deposit pricing and funding mix.Net interest margin (NIM) of 3.01% increased 61 basis points mainly due to the impacts of higher rates on earning assets, partially offset by deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.Non-interest income decreased 19.4% to $2.04 billion. The decline was primarily due to a fall in mortgage banking revenues and service charges.Non-interest expenses, including merger and integration charges, climbed 14.4% to $4.04 billion.The efficiency ratio was 63.3%, higher than the year-ago quarter’s 60.4%. A rise in the ratio indicates a deterioration in profitability.Average total loans improved 6.8% sequentially to $359.8 billion. Average total deposits increased 5.5% to $481.8 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality WorsensNet charge-offs were $578 million, up from $132 million in the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $7.4 billion, up 20.3%. The provision for credit losses in the reported quarter was $1.19 billion against a benefit of $13 million in the prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets (NPAs) were $1.02 billion, and included $329 million acquired from MUFG Union Bank. In the fourth quarter of 2021, NPAs were $878 million.Capital Position WeakensThe Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.8% as of Dec 31, 2022, down from 11.6% in the prior-year quarter. The Tier 1-capital-to-risk-weighted assets ratio was 8.1% as of Dec 31, 2022, down from 9.6%.Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach was 8.4% as of Dec 31, 2022, down from 10% reported in the year-ago quarter.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 4.5%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 6.8%.Our TakeU.S. Bancorp’s solid business model and diverse revenue streams are likely to keep aiding its financials. The company’s strong loan and deposit balances are positives. However, persistently rising expenses and higher provisions might weigh on its bottom line in the near term.U.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | U.S. Bancorp QuoteU.S. Bancorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the bottom line declined 6.9% from the year-ago quarter.Results have been supported by a rise in NII and non-interest income. FRC’s capital position was decent in the quarter. Yet, higher expenses and elevated provision for credit losses were the offsetting factors.Wells Fargo’s WFC fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 67 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Results included several non-recurring items like the $3.3 billion or 70 cents per share of operating losses related to “litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters.”Results benefited from higher NII, rising rates and solid average loan growth. Yet, dismal non-interest income, higher provisions and weakness in the mortgage business were the major undermining factors for WFC.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

From household items and party supplies to pantry items and toys, there are incredible deals around every corner.Dollar Tree: 5 High-Quality Items To Buy NowCheck: 3 Signs You're Serious About Raising Your Credit ScoreBut not everything from Dollar Tree is a steal -- the key is knowing which items give you the best bang for your buck and which are best left on the shelf. GOBankingRates did some research and came up with a list of what to buy and what to skip the next time you shop at Dollar Tree.Tgordievskaya / iStock.comSeasonal ItemsDollar Tree usually has a section dedicated to seasonal items including household decorations, craft supplies, party supplies, costumes and candy. This is a great aisle to shop for inexpensive items that can be given away or donated once the season is over. The particularly great-value items can probably even be used for years to come.What to buy:Seasonal decorGreeting cardsCostumesCandyCraft suppliesWhat to skip:Nothing, since you'll only be using these items for a short time anyway. Compared to prices of seasonal decor at Target and even Walmart, you're going to save a ton on items that typically don't get much use.Take Our Poll: Do You Have a Second Job or Backup Plan in Case You Are Laid Off?RonTech3000 / Shutterstock.comParty SuppliesDollar Tree is an incredible store to get everything you need to stock and decorate your next party. From streamers to gift wrap, you can find pretty much anything you need to liven up your event. Since most of these items get thrown away anyway, you should spend as little as possible. Just a few bucks at Dollar Tree gets a gift wrapped, for instance, versus upwards of $8 or more at larger retailers.What to buy:Wrapping paperRibbonCardsBalloonsStreamersCandlesGift bagsWhat to skip:Paper plates and plastic utensils: This is an area where spending a few extra dollars really pays off. Cheap plates and utensils break easily and aren't very durable. Invest a little more in these goods for the sake of your party guests (and your carpet).Story continuesLeoPatrizi / Getty ImagesKids' and Pets' ItemsYou can find tons of items for the entire family (including pets) at Dollar Tree. Kid-friendly items, from toys to crafts, are so inexpensive you can keep a stash of them aside for rainy days, road trips, play dates and vacation days. For pets, you can also find litter box liners, treat jars, dog waste bags and a whole other host of supplies you need to keep on hand when you have pets. Fun fact: I keep a basket of cheap toys and crafts from Dollar Tree to reward my kids when they've done their chores all week. It's less expensive than an allowance and there's no skin off my back when they eventually get lost or broken.What to buy:BubblesBallsHula-hoopsCard and board gamesGlow sticksCraft suppliesInexpensive toysColoring booksPuzzlesPet treats (not food!)Training pads for puppiesSocks (because who sees your socks)SunglassesWhat to skip:Stuffed animals or dolls: Especially when they have small parts or loose buttons, these items can be choking hazards. Well-made stuffed animals and dolls are safer for children.Cat and dog food: It's worth spending more to feed your pet high-quality food that is specific to their breed, age and size.Dog and cat toys: Some of these items aren't well-made and can also be choking hazards.Shutterstock.comHousehold SuppliesFrom organization and storage bins to washer fluid, Dollar Tree is chock-full of household goods at bargain prices. For instance, a 40-ounce bottle of Pine Sol costs $3 or more, while the same amount of Pine Glow is just $1.25 at Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree also sells many popular name-brand household items for $1.25 like Ajax powder, Lysol Muti-surface Cleaner and Spic &amp; Span Antibacterial Spray Cleanser.What to buy:Cleaning suppliesAir freshenersBleachAmmoniaDryer sheetsPlastic storage binsClothespinsSpongesDisposable glovesGeneric Swiffer refillsPainting supplies for small to medium projectsNails and screwsSome car maintenance products (not motor oil)Washer fluidBatteriesSuper glueDrop clothsWhat to skip:Tools: Tools should be well-made and durable. Many of these items at Dollar Tree aren't.Brooms: Brooms also need to be durable. Focus on quality, not price, since having to replace this item every few of months would quickly add up anyway.Dish soap: Some dish soaps at Dollar Tree aren't tough enough on grease. Stick with your favorite brand that can get the job done well.Garbage bags: No one wants to deal with a garbage bag that splits open. Spend a little more for a brand that can really hold up.Toilet paper, tissue or paper towels: This might go without saying, but these items deal with pretty delicate areas of the body. More expensive brands are typically softer and stronger.Hangers: Don't even bother with cheap hangers, which break and bend and will drive you crazy.Light bulbs: Investing in CFL light bulbs can be expensive, but they use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer, according to Energy Star.VioletaStoimenova / iStock.comKitchen ItemsLike the household section, the kitchen items at Dollar Tree are a steal. The only items we couldn't recommend were generally made of flimsy materials and should be more durable. But everyday or disposable kitchen items are particularly good deal at Dollar Tree, like plastic storage boxes with lids, nesting bins, reusable ice packs, glass prep bowls and more that can to make your kitchen complete. Compared to the plastic storage bin section at Target or glass bowls from Walmart, these items are a real deal.What to buy:Plastic and glass storage containersDisposable baking dishesNapkins and strawsMatchesMeasuring cupsLightersIce packsSandwich bags and lunch bagsDisposable cupsDish setsKids' dishes and snack containersWhat to skip:Knives: Invest in a set of knives that will last a lifetime. The Dollar Tree knives won't.Kitchen scissors: Again, this is a kitchen item that needs to be strong and durable. Don't skimp on a great pair of kitchen scissors.Can openers and peelers: These items need to be tough enough to cut through some serious material.Metal flatware: A nice set of flatware should be heavy and durable. Cheap flatware tends to bend and ding easily.Pots and pans: Like a good set of knives, a great set of pots and pans can last forever. Plus, inexpensive cookware can heat unevenly and make it difficult to create a masterpiece in the kitchen.Aluminum foil: The aluminum foil from Dollar Tree tends to be thin and rips easily, and isn't much cheaper than its name-brand counterparts. Spend just a little more for something more durable.Dishtowels: Dishtowels need to be durable and very absorbent. Cheap ones will frustrate you when all you want to do is get the dishes done and put away.Eva-Katalin / Getty ImagesHealth, Beauty and Personal ProductsThe Dollar Tree has fabulous prices on health, beauty and personal care items, including brands sold at pricier stores like Target and Walmart. A few things, like hair color and makeup, probably aren't worth skimping on, but there is a huge selection of high-quality items at low prices. For example, Dollar Tree has Carmex lip balm, VO5 and White Rain hair products and compact mirrors for only a dollar, compared to $4 or more for comparable items at Walmart.What to buy:CombsHair accessories, ties and clipsMirrorsMake up spongesTravel-size bottlesEarplugsEmory boardsName brand medicationsCough dropsPill organizersRubbing alcoholToothbrushesShaving creamFlossName brand toothpasteCotton swabs and ballsNail polish removerWhat to skip:Hairbrushes: Take care of your locks with a hairbrush that is made to last and specific to your hair type.Soap: Be kind to your skin with a soap made with gentle ingredients.Makeup: Cheap makeup can have fillers and oils you want to keep off your face.Feminine products: These items need to be absorbent and well-made. It's not worth skimping on quality and risking embarrassment.Vitamins: Buy vitamins from a quality producer so you know exactly what you are getting.Hair color: This at-home hair treatment can go really wrong, so use the highest-quality color you can afford to avoid a mishap.Razors: Inexpensive razors aren't as sharp and won't leave you with the closest shave possible. Spend more on a razor you can reuse over and over again. You'll likely save more in the long run and your skin will thank you for it.Bandages: Thin, weak bandages won't do your injuries much good. Spend a little more for a brand with staying power.iStock.comGroceriesYou probably don't want to do all your grocery shopping at Dollar Tree, but it offers some grocery items at great values, especially if you are throwing a party. In some cases, even Dollar Tree can't beat coupon deals at other grocers, so compare prices at both stores before you buy. Still, for just $1.25 at Dollar Tree you can get snacks like a 4-pack of Slim Jim beef jerky, a box of Nature Valley oat bars, a wide variety of spices and tons of baking supplies.What to buy:Large bags of candyFrozen fruits and veggiesRiceOatmealSpicesPopsiclesDrink mixesCondimentsChips, cookies and crackersWhat to skip:Juice: Many of the juices at Dollar Tree have a lot of sugar and artificial ingredients.Canned goods: These items tend to be limited and many have added salt or other unhealthy ingredients.Cereal: These are usually on sale at larger grocery stores and if you use coupons, you will likely get better prices and higher quality than at Dollar Tree.PaulPaladin / Getty Images/iStockphotoSchool and Office SuppliesYou can save a bundle shopping for school and office supplies at Dollar Tree. Like everything on our list, some items are worth paying a little extra for, like calculators and computer paper, but it's still worth making a stop in this aisle for some basics. For example, a bottle of screen cleaner at Walmart sells for $7 and box of binder clips at Target is almost $11!What to buy:Folders and bindersTapePoster boardMailing suppliesBinder clipsCell phone screen protectorsScreen cleaning cloth and wipesPaper for drawing or handwritingWhat to skip:Dry erase boards and markers: Spend more on dry erasers and boards that clean well and easily.Calculators: These items typically get a lot of use and need to have strong battery life and reliable functionality.Crayons: Cheap crayons break easily which can lead to frustration and tears. A box of quality crayons at Target is only a dollar or two more and will last longer.Computer paper: Cheap computer paper can get stuck in your printer.Glue sticks: Inexpensive glue sticks don't work as well and dry out faster. Spend just a little more and one swipe will get the job done.More From GOBankingRatesFood Stamps: What Is the Maximum SNAP EBT Benefit for 2023?Do You Have a Tax Question?

This is expected to be February 21, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Walmart to post earnings of $1.50 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.96%.

The pay hikes will kick in beginning on March 2, 2023.In addition, the minimum wage for Walmart store employees will rise to $14 an hour from $12 an hour, CNBC reported, citing comments from a Walmart spokesperson. Beginning in March, store employees will earn between $14 and $19 an hour, up from $12 to $18 currently.Walmart has about 1.7 million workers in the United States – the most of any private employer – and nearly all of them (94%) are hourly employees, CNN reported. The retailer has long faced criticism from labor groups for its low pay, but that has changed in recent years amid a move by Walmart to hike wages so it can better compete with rivals such as Target, Amazon and Costco.As CNN noted, dozens of companies, including Walmart, have laid off corporate staff in recent months. But because of strong demand for service industry workers, employers have been forced to offer higher pay and other perks just to fill payrolls. Walmart has nearly 30,000 store jobs listed on its hiring website.Nationally, the number of job openings stood at a historically high 10.5 million in November, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor. That’s much higher than the 6 million people who were unemployed that month.Take Our Poll: Are You In Favor of More Inflation Relief in 2023?For its part, Walmart is offering more than just higher pay to lure workers. Here are some of the other perks it is rolling out:Story continuesContinued investments in Auto Care Center (ACC) employees. Last fall Walmart created a higher-paying Auto Care Center coach role. It now plans to introduce a higher-paying ACC team lead position and raise the pay of ACC tech employees to reflect the special skills needed for the role.New college degrees and certificates for Walmart’s Live Better U (LBU) education program. The new options are designed to help employees gain the skills needed to unlock new career opportunities. Both part-time and full-time associates can participate in LBU on their first day and Walmart will pay 100% of the tuition and fees.Expansion of the Associate-to-Driver Program.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -0.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has lost 0.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.08 points to a change of -5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.52 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walmart is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Walmart, the consensus sales estimate of $158.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.9%. The $605.64 billion and $623.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.7% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $1.50 for the same period compares with $1.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.67%. The EPS surprise was +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Excluding expenses related to acquisitions and the favorable impact of an insurance settlement received during the quarter, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $505 million(2), or $2.29 per diluted share(2).Quarterly net revenues were flat compared to the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and down 2% compared to the preceding quarter, largely driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks, offset by lower investment banking revenues and asset management and related administrative fees.Story continuesRecord quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 14% over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter largely due to higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks. Annualized return on common equity for the fiscal first quarter was 21.3% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity was 26.1%(2).“During a volatile and challenging market environment, we generated record quarterly earnings as the benefit of higher interest rates more than offset the decline in capital markets results,” said Chair and CEO Paul Reilly. “Once again, our results highlight the value of having diverse and complementary businesses. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we are well positioned with strong capital ratios and a flexible balance sheet.”Segment ResultsPrivate Client GroupDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1) of $23.2 billion for the fiscal first quarter, 9.8% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assetsRecord quarterly net revenues of $2.06 billion, up 12% over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 4% over the preceding quarterRecord quarterly pre-tax income of $434 million, up 123% over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 17% over the preceding quarterPrivate Client Group assets under administration of $1.11 trillion, down 7% compared to December 2021 and up 7% over September 2022Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $633.1 billion, down 7% compared to December 2021 and up 8% over September 2022Private Client Group financial advisors of 8,699 increased 235 over December 2021 and 18 over September 2022 Clients’ domestic cash sweep balances of $60.4 billion, down 18% compared to December 2021 and 10% compared to September 2022Growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was driven primarily by the increases in RJBDP fees and net interest income which more than offset the market-driven declines in asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues.Total clients’ domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $60.4 billion, down 18% compared to December 2021 and 10% compared to September 2022. The sequential decline reflects continued cash sorting activity given the higher short-term interest rate environment. These balances do not include any high-yield savings deposits or money market fund balances. Reflecting higher short-term interest rates, the average yield on RJBDP third-party bank balances was 2.72% in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 244 basis points over the prior year period and 87 basis points over the preceding quarter.“With our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisors, we generated strong domestic net new assets of approximately $23 billion(1) during the quarter, an annualized growth rate of 9.8%,” said Reilly. “Recruiting activity remains strong across all of our affiliation options, driven by our advisor and client-focused culture and leading technology and product offerings.”Capital MarketsQuarterly net revenues of $295 million, down 52% compared to the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 26% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax loss of $16 millionQuarterly investment banking revenues of $133 million, down 68% compared to the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 36% compared to the preceding quarterThe decline in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was largely attributable to lower investment banking revenues. Fixed income brokerage revenues declined from the prior-year quarter as the favorable impact of revenues from our July 1, 2022 acquisition of SumRidge Partners was more than offset by decreased activity from depository clients.“Capital markets activity slowed considerably from record-setting results a year ago, driven by continued market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties,” said Reilly. “Although the investment banking pipeline is healthy, we expect the current headwinds will continue negatively impacting the timing of closings.”Asset ManagementQuarterly net revenues of $207 million, down 12% compared to the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 4% compared to the preceding quarter Quarterly pre-tax income of $80 million, down 25% compared to the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 4% compared to the preceding quarterFinancial assets under management of $185.9 billion, down 9% compared to December 2021 and up 7% over September 2022The decline of quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income compared to the prior-year quarter was largely attributable to lower financial assets under management, as net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group were offset by fixed income and equity market declines.BankRecord quarterly net revenues of $508 million, up 178% over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 19% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $136 million, up 33% over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 11% over the preceding quarterBank segment net interest margin (“NIM”) of 3.36% for the quarter, up 144 basis points over the prior year’s fiscal first quarter and 45 basis points over the preceding quarterRecord net loans of $44.1 billion, up 69% over December 2021 and 2% over September 2022Growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was primarily due to NIM expansion, along with higher assets. The Bank segment’s NIM increased 45 basis points during the quarter to 3.36%, reflecting higher short-term interest rates and the relatively high concentration of floating-rate assets. Net loans grew 2% over the preceding quarter primarily driven by higher corporate loans and residential mortgages. The bank loan loss provision for credit losses of $14 million in the quarter reflects changes to macroeconomic assumptions, in contrast to the bank loan benefit for credit losses in the prior-year quarter. The credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong, with criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ending the quarter at 1.01%, down from 2.75% at December 2021 and 1.14% at September 2022. Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans held for investment was 0.92%, and bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.64%.OtherThe Other segment includes the receipt of a $32 million insurance settlement related to a previously settled litigation matter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9%, reflecting a tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation that vested during the period.In December, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares 24% to $0.42 per share and authorized common stock repurchases of up to $1.5 billion, replacing the previous authorization of $1 billion. During the fiscal first quarter, the firm repurchased 1.29 million shares of common stock for $138 million at an average price of $106 per share. As of January 25, 2023, $1.4 billion remained available under the Board’s approved common stock repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 21.5%(3) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.3%(3), both well above the regulatory requirements.A conference call to discuss the results will take place today, Wednesday, January 25, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables.The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation, and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views its businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating MarginAdjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income (loss).

Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC and W. R. Berkley Corporation WRB, which are due to report tomorrow. However, an active catastrophe level is likely to have weighed on their performance.Premiums are likely to have benefited from continued improved pricing, strong retention and exposure growth across business lines. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided in better pricing in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of winter storm Elliot.  Karen Clark &amp; Company estimates industry losses from Elliot to be about $5.4 billion. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are likely to witness improved investment results. The last year saw seven rate hikes, with the fourth quarter witnessing two hikes by the Fed. A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income.Accelerated digitalization is expected to have saved costs, thus aiding margins. A solid capital position aided insurers in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand geographically and diversify their portfolio, apart from enhancing shareholders value via share buybacks and raising dividends.Let’s take a sneak peek into how the abovementioned insurers are poised prior to their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 26.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Arthur J. Gallagher’s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect new business, strong retention and renewal premium increases across its business lines.Arthur J. Gallagher estimates organic revenue growth from existing clients, growing claim counts and new business to have favored Brokerage and Risk Management segments. Total expenses are likely to have increased. We expect total expense of $1.6 billion in the to-be-reported quarter. (Read more: What's in Store for Arthur J.

MMC’s margins are expected to have taken a hit from escalating compensation and benefits costs, coupled with expenses related to talent investments in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the last earnings call, foreign exchange is expected to have an adverse impact of 7 cents per share on Marsh &amp; McLennan’s margins in the fourth quarter.

MMC may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Marsh &amp; McLennan is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MMC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.41 per share for MMC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MMC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.36% heading into earnings season.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.

50,f71f0f6a-c70f-36e0-9ced-ade6e082fb83,EQR,2023-01-26,Analysts Just Upgraded These 3 Apartment REITs,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-upgraded-3-apartment-161722525.html,1674663442,STORY,"['TGT', 'AVB', 'EQR', 'CPT']","[As real estate investment trusts (REITs) were underperforming in 2022, analysts in the major brokerages and banks were busy slashing target prices and downgrading many of the REITs, citing threats from inflation, higher interest rates, increasing risk of defaults, increasing occupancy and higher costs.But 2023 seems to be ushering in a new, more friendly stance by analysts, and there have been many more upgrades in ratings and price targets since the beginning of the month. Analysts are starting to see better times ahead, assuming the Federal Reserve eases up on the severity and duration of interest rate hikes.Take a look at three residential apartment-focused REITs that have recently received analyst upgrades:AvalonBay Communities Inc. (NYSE: AVB) is a residential REIT that acquires, develops and manages multifamily communities. As of Sept. 30, AvalonBay Communities owned directly or indirectly 88,405 apartments in 293 communities in 12 states and Washington, D.C. The 52-week range is $157.69 to $259.05, and the most recent closing price was $170.35.Since its inception in June 1998, AvalonBay Communities has had a successful performance record, averaging 8.52% total returns annually. Its annual dividend of $6.36 per share yields 3.73%.On Jan. 17, analyst Michael Lewis of Truist Securities upgraded AvalonBay Communities from Hold to Buy, while raising the price target from $186 to $190. At its most recent closing price, this represents an upside potential of 11.54%.This latest upgrade is eye-catching, considering that AvalonBay Communities was the recipient of six downgrades by well-known firms, including J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, between November and the beginning of January. Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) is a Chicago-based REIT that owns or is invested in 308 apartment buildings with 79,594 units located in large urban areas, such as Boston, New York, Washington D.C, Seattle, San Francisco and Denver. It’s a member of the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesEquity Residential pays an annual dividend of $2.50, which currently yields 4%. The dividend has grown 24% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations over that time.On Jan. 17, Lewis of Truist Securities also upgraded Equity Residential from Hold to Buy, and he announced a new price target of $68. From its most recent closing price of $61.60, he sees potential for an increase of 10.38%.Like AvalonBay Communities, Equity Residential has also received three different downgrades over the last five weeks.Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) is a Houston-based residential REIT that owns and manages over 240,000 square feet of apartment complexes in major cities across the U.S. Its strategy is to focus on high-growth markets. Some of its apartment complexes also contain ground-floor retail space, offices or mixed-use space. Camden Property Trust is a member of the S&amp;P 500.During the third quarter of 2022, Camden Property Trust expanded its share repurchase plan from $269 million to $500 million. Its most recent same-property occupancy rate was 96.6%.Camden Property Trust pays a dividend of $3.76, which has grown 25% over the past five years with no cuts or eliminations. It presently yields about 3.1%.On Jan. 10, Mizuho Securities USA analyst Haendel St. Juste upgraded Camden Property Trust from Neutral to Buy, with an increase in price target from $119 to $125. At the current price of $114.68, this represents a potential upside increase of 9%. Unlike the two previous REITs, analysts have been much kinder to Camden Property Trust in recent months, maintaining previous positive ratings even while lowering price targets.Investors should keep in mind that analysts are not always correct, and even the better ones are only right about 50% of the time. Investors should not only rely on analysts but always do their own research before purchasing any stock.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

54,ca9f8c5a-a254-3d71-9765-5227a223774c,MET,2023-01-26,Earnings Preview: MetLife (MET) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-metlife-met-q4-150003273.html,1674658803,STORY,['MET-PE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when MetLife (MET) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.9%.Revenues are expected to be $16.95 billion, down 16.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MetLife?For MetLife, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MetLife will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MetLife would post earnings of $1.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of +2.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MetLife doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

55,12d25bff-8d8c-3e7c-9656-f631e0c14fa0,IT,2023-01-26,Why Gartner (IT) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gartner-poised-beat-earnings-171005476.html,1674666605,STORY,['IT'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Gartner (IT), which belongs to the Zacks Consulting Services industry.This technology information and analysis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 31.72%.For the last reported quarter, Gartner came out with earnings of $2.41 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 per share, representing a surprise of 30.27%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.85 per share, delivering a surprise of 33.18%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Gartner lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Gartner has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 7, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And the Redmond-based software giant’s $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI could be the key to doing just that.The move, which Microsoft and OpenAI announced on Monday, will allow Microsoft to deploy GPT-3, the service that the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT is based on, and other platforms across its various cloud-based services. And that could spell trouble for rivals ranging from Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Salesforce (CRM).“It tells you a lot that within a week of announcing pretty substantial layoffs, Microsoft is also announcing a substantial investment in OpenAI,” Gil Luria, technology strategist at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance. Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees last week across a host of departments.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is investing billions into AI technologies to put Microsoft ahead of rivals including Amazon, Google, and Salesforce. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)“It tells you that that's where they think a lot of the future growth for Microsoft can come from, and that the technology that OpenAI is developing can drive meaningful improvements to a broad set of products for them.”Microsoft’s investments should help it build out AI-powered improvements to its Azure platform, offer better features for its various productivity and enterprise programs, and could even make its search engine Bing a worthy competitor to market leader Google.But GPT-3 isn’t without its flaws, and Microsoft’s rivals aren’t simply waiting for the Windows maker to become an AI juggernaut. They’re making investments of their own in the hopes that they’ll cut off Microsoft.OpenAI could could give Microsoft the edge over the competitionOpenAI gained popularity with the release of its DALL-E AI-powered image generating software in 2021. The company introduced a second version the last year. The platform generates images based on prompts you specify. For instance, typing in “A cat riding a dinosaur digital art,” will create an image of a cat riding a dino in the style of digital art. They're not perfect images, but they get the point across.Story continuesAn image generated by DALL-E 2 using the prompt 'A picture of a cat riding a dinosaur digital art.' (Image: OpenAI)ChatGPT, meanwhile, is a generative AI chatbot that can spit out human-like answers to prompts. Ask it a question like how far away is the moon from Earth and it will tell you. Ask it to write a story about a maniac barber that eats human hair, and you’ll get an incredibly bizarre story about just that.But OpenAI’s capabilities are about more than just cats and hair hungry stylists. Analysts say it could be a boon to Microsoft’s cloud, enterprise, and search businesses.“OpenAI tools can be integrated into various [Microsoft] platforms including Outlook and Office 365 productivity tools,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.“With ChapGPT, Azure cloud infrastructure can provide new services not yet seen within the Azure ecosystem, including digital assistants and AI-based financial services to tap into a new customer base seeking alternative solutions for cloud products,” he added.Those kinds of investments would help Microsoft tackle both Amazon, which is the leader in cloud services and owns 34% of the global market, according to Synergy Research Group, and Google which owns 11% of the market. Microsoft holds 21% of the market.Both Amazon and Google offer their own AI capabilities as part of their cloud platforms, but OpenAI’s technologies are far buzzier and could attract more customers to Microsoft’s services.A story generated by ChatGPT using the prompt 'Tell me a story about a maniac barber who eats human hair.' (Image: OpenAI)Microsoft, Ives predicts, could also wrap its OpenAI investments into its various gaming initiatives, giving it competitive advantage over the likes of Sony (SONY) and Nintendo (NTODY).One of the biggest potential opportunities for Microsoft is using OpenAI’s technology to improve its Bing search engine. With just 3% of global market share, Bing is a distant second to Google’s search engine, which owns 92% of the market.But Google Search answers questions in stiff, mechanical language. With GPT-3-like capabilities, Bing would be able to answer queries with more natural phrasing and even allow users to follow up with secondary questions and answers.“When we start incorporating generative AI into search, that's going to materially change the nature of competition in the search market and give Bing an opportunity it really hasn't had in decades to be competitive with Google search,” Luria said. “That is a very substantial opportunity now that the search market is going to become a…jump ball again.”Microsoft’s dominance is anything but assuredThat said, there’s no guarantee that the billions Microsoft is pouring into OpenAI will push aside its rivals. ChatGPT, GPT-3, DALL-E and their ilk are impressive pieces of technology, but they’re not foolproof.The platform requires huge amounts of data to learn how to respond to queries. ChatGPT, in particular, is an offline-only platform that’s been trained on data from 2021, meaning you can’t do things like ask it the weather or even who won the midterm elections.And while the software is impressive in how it responds in a more natural way than other platforms, it’s not always accurate. OpenAI says as much when you sign up to use ChatGPT.It will also be difficult for Microsoft to dislodge Google Search from its position as the world leader in search market share. The company’s name is ubiquitous with online search. Heck, it’s even used as a verb for looking up information online.“Google is part of the fabric of the internet based on number of users,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a research note.“I believe that the company has four products with &gt;1B monthly users including Search, Chrome, Gmail and YouTube. Additionally, I believe they have two products with &gt;500m monthly users including Google Drive and Google Photos. Maintaining users is a powerful competitive advantage for Google, and it means that GPT-3 needs to be 10X better than whatever Google will announce,” he said.For Microsoft to win out, it’s going to have to continue to work with OpenAI to develop tools that can put its competitors to shame. That could take months or years, depending on how fast the duo can iterate on and pair OpenAI’s technologies with Microsoft’s services. But if it can pull it off, Amazon, Google, and Salesforce could be in for some serious trouble.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

As such, it seems to back up the accusation, which has often been leveled at Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, that he has become “distracted” by celebrity friendships, philanthropy, and other pursuits aside from increasing Salesforce’s stock price.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureWhere does such a detail come from? Matthew McConaughey is a “brand partner,” and starred in a 2022 Super Bowl ad to promote Salesforce’s TeamEarth initiative designed to improve business practices, particularly around the environment. Will.i.am’s tech business received Salesforce funding back in 2017 and he’s appeared onstage at Salesforce events and in videos online. But do either of them belong at meetings?The “person familiar with the company” who told the Financial Times that the celebrities were “frequently involved in strategy discussions” there probably didn’t think so, hence leaking the names to the press. In a struggle for credibility and, ultimately, control of a $150 billion company, it’s not a crazy guess that the people who did the leaking were themselves among the activist investors keen that Benioff appear as an ineffective leader.Activist investors weigh inSalesforce has had a mixed few years. On the one hand, it has seen huge revenue growth, which Benioff is said to have prioritized over profits: The FT reports that sales leapt from $8 billion in 2017 to an estimated $31 billion in 2022, but profits have risen less dramatically. Salesforce has also made expensive, high-profile acquisitions like when it bought Slack, the workplace collaboration platform, in December 2020. In recent months, three well-known activist investors—Elliott Management, Starboard Capital, and Jeff Ubben via Inclusive Capital—have built up large stakes in the business.Story continuesShareholders often argue that, while they have a responsibility to help companies run well and make money, they don’t want to “micromanage” business leaders. Activist investors are a different breed, however, often buying up big parcels of a company’s shares quickly with a view to exerting pressure on certain areas of the business, or pushing for leadership change.Whatever Matthew McConaughey and Will.i.am were doing in those Salesforce meetings, the fact we know they were there suggests Salesforce founder Mark Benioff, sole CEO once more after a short stint as co-head of the company, is going to have a fight on his hands.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and NIKE Inc. NKE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Enhance Your PortfolioThe consumer discretionary sector suffered the most in terrible 2022. The inflation rate was at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate to its highest level in 15 years and its strict monetary tightening raised the risk-free market interest rate to a two-decade high. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth sectors like consumer discretionary.However, as we have entered 2023, consumer discretionary has shown an initial sign of revival. Month to date, of the 11 broad sectors of the market's benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR has gained 9.3%, second only to the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR that has rallied 12.6%.At this stage, investment in consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should become fruitful. Five such stocks are - Deckers Outdoor Corp., Activision Blizzard Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp. and NIKE Inc..     Consumer Discretionary Sector to Revive in 2023The consumer discretionary sector is set to revive its fortune this year. Here are the reasons:(1) Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.Story continues(2) The Fed raised  the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 to the range of 4.25-4.5%. Market is currently expecting the central  bank to increase the interest rate by maximum 75 basis points in 2023. Some financial analysts are expecting the first rate cut to come in the last quarter of 2023 or in early 2024.(3) Headwinds of the pandemic are also behind us. China is gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.(4) The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Deckers Outdoor is a leading designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports, and other lifestyle-related activities.DECK's focus on expanding brand assortments, introducing more innovative lines of products, targeting consumers digitally and optimizing omni-channel distribution have been contributing to its performance. DECK is targeting profitable and underpenetrated markets, and remains focused on product innovations, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities.Deckers Outdoor has an expected earnings growth rate of 11.4% for the current year (ending March 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Activision Blizzard develops and distributes content and services on video game consoles, personal computers and mobile devices. ATVI's top line is expected to benefit from an expanding user base of Call of Duty (COD), Hearthstone, World of Warcraft (WoW) and Candy Crush franchises. This is expected to boost in-games spending. Moreover, the growing popularity of Diablo II: Resurrected is expected to boost top-line growth. ATVI's strong liquidity position and free cash flow generation ability are noteworthy.Activision Blizzard has an expected earnings growth rate of 28.6% for the current year.

83,d2987ef3-7052-3cfd-aacc-e75e26b8a72f,PCG,2023-01-26,What PG&E Corporation's (NYSE:PCG) ROE Can Tell Us,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-corporations-nyse-pcg-172639001.html,1674667599,STORY,['PCGU'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PG&amp;E is:7.8% = US$1.8b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.Does PG&amp;E Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that PG&amp;E has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Electric Utilities industry (9.1%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for PG&amp;E.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesPG&amp;E's Debt And Its 7.8% ROEPG&amp;E clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.49. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: PG&amp;E may not be the best stock to buy.

On average across the 50 largest U.S. metros in December, a typical renter faced a 41.4% ($792) lower monthly payment than a starter homeowner.1The markets with the largest monthly savings for renters, ranked by the percent difference between monthly mortgage payments and asking rents, include:Austin, Texas (121.3% or $2,013)San Francisco, Calif. (97.0% or $2,855)Seattle, Wash. (86.1% or $1,772)San Jose, Calif. (83.0% or $2,621)San Diego, Calif. (77.2% or $2,085)Los Angeles, Calif. (74.9% or $2,150)Boston, Mass. (73.1% or $2,097)Portland, Ore. (71.2% or $1,246)Phoenix, Ariz. (70.1% or $1,116)Sacramento, Calif (67.7% or $1,241)""Despite the fact that renting will likely be cheaper than buying in 2023, rental affordability will remain a key issue throughout the year. We expect rents will keep hitting new highs, driven by factors including still-low vacancy rates, lagging new construction and demand from would-be first-time buyers,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""For prospective first-time buyers, the key consideration when figuring out whether to buy or rent is how long you plan to live in your next home. If you're looking for flexibility to move in the shorter term, renting may be your best bet, and still offer opportunities to save if you're able to compromise on factors like proximity to the downtown area. Whereas buying could be the better option if you're planning to stay put for at least five years. Market conditions will play a role, but ultimately the timing comes down to your personal situation, and tools like the Realtor.com® Rent vs. Buy Calculator can help you organize and make sense of the many considerations.""Story continuesIn December, renters faced lower monthly costs than first-time buyers, on average across the 50 largest U.S. metros and in the vast majority (45) of these markets. Additionally, the gap between the cost of renting and buying a similar-sized home widened significantly compared to December 2021. While this was partly attributed to the slowdown in rent growth seen over the past year, December trends indicate that the increase in relative rental affordability was primarily driven by skyrocketing mortgage rates.In December, the U.S. median rental price, $1,712, was $792 lower than a typical monthly starter home payment. Just 12 months ago, the difference was -$174.The widening gap between rents and first-time buying costs is largely attributed to higher starter homeownership monthly costs ($2,504), which grew 37.4% year-over-year in December – more than 10 times faster than rents (+3.2%) during the same period. Furthermore, despite the slowdown in year-over-year rent growth seen in recent months, typical asking rents ended the year up an average of 11.6% year-over-year.Renting was more affordable than first-time buying in 45 of the 50 largest markets in December, up from 30 markets at the same time last year. In the top 10 metros that favored renting over first-time buying (see table below), monthly starter homeownership costs were an average of 82.2% (+$1,920) higher than rents.Just five markets favored starter homeownership over renting in December, in terms of offering lower monthly costs; these were: Memphis, Tenn. (-32.7%), Pittsburgh (-24.1%), Birmingham, Ala. (-23.5%), St. Louis, Mo. (-6.9%) and Baltimore, Md.

It is in talks to sell the stake in Move for more than $3 billion, Reuters has reported.Since the move to renuite Fox and News Corp was first announced in October last year, a number of large shareholders on both sides had opposed the deal.T. Rowe Price, the biggest investor in News Corp with a roughly 12% stake, had previously expressed concerns that the deal would undervalue News Corp. On Wednesday, portfolio manager Vincent DeAugustino cheered News Corp's decision to scrap the deal.""We applaud the decision to forgo such a transaction as News Corp considers other options to unlock value,"" he said in a statement.On Tuesday, activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which had also opposed the proposed reunion of Fox and News Corp, applauded the decision to not move forward.Cowen &amp; Co's Doug Creutz said investors were pleased by the decision to walk away from a potential combination, saying that pressure from investors like T Rowe Price weighed on the Murdoch's decision to pursue the deal.A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders. Fox shares were up about 2% on Wednesday.Story continuesWhile News Corp's decision to sell Move has been positively received, questions now remain on the future of the company's non-media assets, which include its stake in Australian real estate company REA Group Ltd.""The other big question is – does News Corp give their shareholders their pro-rata shares of REA in addition to selling Move? That would clean out the real estate holdings of the company and simplify the structure of News Corp, which is greatly needed as the company is overly complicated,"" said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research.(Reporting by Milana Vinn and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Writing by Anirban Sen; Editing by Daniel Wallis)]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Merit Medical has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MMSI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ALGN has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.MMSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 24.69, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 31.78. We also note that MMSI has a PEG ratio of 2.24. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 25.83.Another notable valuation metric for MMSI is its P/B ratio of 3.65. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ALGN has a P/B of 5.34.These metrics, and several others, help MMSI earn a Value grade of B, while ALGN has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesMMSI sticks out from ALGN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that MMSI is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

93,1e8b553e-1a03-361d-9c86-eb3a6b7d81bd,ALGN,2023-01-26,Earnings Preview: Align Technology (ALGN) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-align-technology-algn-150003002.html,1674658803,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Align Technology (ALGN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of the Invisalign tooth-straightening system is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -45.6%.Revenues are expected to be $889.99 million, down 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.41% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Align Technology?For Align Technology, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Align Technology will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Align Technology would post earnings of $2.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.36, delivering a surprise of -38.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Align Technology doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Large cap stocks are preferred by investors because they are typically well-established companies with a strong track record of performance and stability. These stocks are considered less risky than small-cap stocks, which are issued by newer or smaller companies that may be more volatile. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer behavior shifted towards technology-based activities such as online shopping and streaming services. However, as the economy started to recover and people returned to their pre-pandemic habits, some of these tech companies may have seen a decline in business. Despite that, large-cap stocks, including tech plays, have always been an attractive option for investors, since they protect portfolios from market volatility relatively well. Gradient Investments’ Mariann Montagne joined CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ on January 19, and she explained that investors should look for companies that meet or exceed earnings expectations and grow backlogs faster than the overall market. She noted that now is the time to load up on high quality large-cap names, which are reasonably priced and offer a lot of value. Some of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 large cap stocks — companies which have market capitalizations of between $10 billion and $200 billion — that have P/E ratios of less than 10 as of January 24. That means the stocks mentioned in the article are the most popular undervalued large-cap stocks among the elite hedge funds operating in financial markets. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues15 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMost Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 8.51Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar initiated coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve its capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should draw investors' attention to its strong cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks popular among smart investors. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”14. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 4.39Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a Texas-based company that manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services in the United States. On November 28, Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) announced the expansion of its existing stock repurchase plan by $1 billion to a total of nearly $1.5 billion, inclusive of the remaining outstanding authorization at the end of the third quarter of 2022. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds.  On January 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) from $72 to $90 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. He now has more confidence in his belief that residential new construction will ""remain surprisingly resilient"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were bullish on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 5.76 million shares worth $340 million.Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”13. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.37Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas. It operates as an independent exploration and production company in the United States and internationally. The company returned $1,176 million to equity holders in the third quarter of 2022, a record for shareholder distributions, including $1,122 million of share repurchases and $54 million of base dividends. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to monitor.  On January 13, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear reiterated an Overweight rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $42. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), with 8.3 million shares worth $188 million. Overall, 50 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of September 2022. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”12. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.75Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. It operates through two segments, Refining &amp; Marketing, and Midstream. In Q3 2022, the company announced a dividend increase of approximately 30% to $0.75 per share. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to invest in according to smart investors. On January 9, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen raised the firm's price target on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) from $126 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. She expects the company to report another quarter of strong Refining &amp; Marketing earnings due to the favorable macroeconomic conditions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was part of 50 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, and Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11 million shares worth over $1 billion. Here is what Clark Street Value has to say about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”11. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 24: 6.76Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily focuses on the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company reported Q3 net earnings of $1.9 billion, or $2.88/ per share, and operating cash flow rose 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to consider. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The company's recent purchases and current resources are in line with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s aim of producing up to 5% more annually. However, the rating is neutral because the market is aware of the stock's recent performance, according to the analyst. Additionally, the analyst noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) should use more of its free cash flow to buy back shares in order to improve metrics over time.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 51 hedge funds were bullish on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $642 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.60Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products. The company also distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, and seeds. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in Saskatoon, Canada. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to elite investors. On January 24, UBS analyst Joshua Spector maintained a ""Buy"" rating and a $103 price target on Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) and has designated it as a Top Pick in a research note titled ""2023 Fertilizer Outlook"". The analyst believes that while fertilizer prices are expected to be lower, it will be partially offset by lower input costs for natural gas. Additionally, the analyst noted that the seasonal peak in demand during spring will provide support for pricing and act as a positive catalyst for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), compared to 48 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $701.8 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“However, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”9. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.98Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is a Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company that has oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.

(NASDAQ:FANG) was part of 55 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 54 in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.26 million shares worth $152 million.  In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as the oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B. The company raised the dividend for the third time this year to $2/share annually while authorizing a new $2B share repurchase program. Starting in 4Q21, the company plans to return 50% of Free Cash Flow to shareholders through the base dividend and a combination of buybacks and special dividends. Finally, the CEO Travis Stice announced plans to reduce methane emissions by 70% as part of the firm’s ESG initiative.”8.

EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to invest in according to smart investors. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) with an Overweight rating and a $41 price target. The company is the largest U.S. natural gas producer and one of the biggest exploration and production companies by volume and resource base. The analyst anticipates modest growth for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) through 2025 due to market access limitations but views the company's overreliance on gas as a ""modest headwind for equity performance"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the largest position holder in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of September 2022, with 6.5 million shares worth $263.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy  has to say about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”7. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61P/E Ratio as of January 24: 7.95AT&amp;T Inc.

(NYSE:T) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In the Dividend Equity accounts, the three best performers in Q2 include AT&amp;T (NYSE:T, 2.5%), up 17.1%. AT&amp;T completed the spin off of the WarnerMedia business (HBO, CNN, etc.), and the market seemed to like the “back-to-basics” approach. Also, the telco business is expected to do relatively well in an inflationary environment.”6. Verizon Communications Inc.

The EU officials indicated on the call they intended to begin talks with Microsoft about potential remedies, the person said.That prompted the FTC to file its case the same day to send a strong signal to EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and her staff, the people said, even though technically the commission wouldn’t entertain remedy proposals from the companies until later in the process.Officials from the EU and the UK aren’t expected to decide on the deal until April, and typically US officials would wait until closer to the deadline and try to work out a global resolution. People close to the transaction said they weren’t expecting action from the FTC until the spring.By moving quickly, the FTC would be able to “get out in front of the Europeans in an effort to shape the narrative,” said Barry Nigro, who served as the No. 2 antitrust official at the Justice Department during the Trump administration and now heads the antitrust practice at Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP. He isn’t involved in the Microsoft-Activision case.Story continuesThe FTC declined to comment. The European Union’s antitrust watchdog declined to comment, saying its investigation of the deal is continuing. Microsoft pointed to comments President Brad Smith made when the FTC filed its case: “Even with confidence in our case, we remain committed to creative solutions with regulators that will protect competition, consumers and workers in the tech sector.”Microsoft’s Activision takeover requires approval from 16 jurisdictions, with the US FTC, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission representing the biggest hurdles. The three international agencies have been in close contact on the deal since it was announced in January 2022.The European Commission is conducting an in-depth probe and has a deadline to make a decision by April 11. The commission is expected to issue a so-called statement of objections in the near future, setting out potential reasons for blocking the deal if no remedies are forthcoming. Such filings are routine in big deals and don’t necessarily indicate a transaction is headed for a veto.The UK regulator is also reviewing the transaction and plans to issue a preliminary decision later this month or early February, with a final decision on April 26.Microsoft intends to propose a global remedy package to EU competition officials that would guarantee Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation would continue to have access to the popular Call of Duty game for the next 10 years. Sony has so far rebuffed Microsoft’s offers. The Xbox maker has also entered into a deal to bring the game to Nintendo Co. and allow it to be sold by Valve Corp.’s PC gaming platform Steam. If EU officials accepted that remedy, which would apply globally, it could potentially undermine cases brought in the US or UK.The EU has diverged from its fellow agencies before. In February, the commission accepted a settlement and approved a merger between Finland’s two shipping equipment giants. A month later, the UK and US simultaneously said they would block the deal and the companies abandoned the merger.--With assistance from Anna Edgerton, Stephanie Bodoni and Peter Chapman.(Updates with EU response in sixth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA $500 Million Bet on Reinvigorating Japan’s Aging Ski IndustryAfter 30 Years, the King of ETFs Faces a Fight for Its CrownSpanish-Speaking Streamers Are the Hottest Thing on TwitchHow to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a YearThe Secret to EV Success Is the Software©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Read this and more market news on the go with the Yahoo Finance App.Stocks mounted an impressive comeback Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) nearly erasing its biggest opening deficit since October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) eked out a small gain — its fourth straight — after spending most of the day in the red.Even Microsoft (MSFT) rallied back from a 4.6% early loss to end the day down only about half a percent.As we've been writing, this year's market action has been a reversal of one of last year's most important trends, which saw the Dow outperform the Nasdaq by the widest margin in two decades.This year, the Nasdaq is now up 8%, substantially outperforming the Dow's return of just under 2%.And while it's unlikely a new bull market led by tech has begun, this relative performance is a tantalizing reminder of the gains tech bulls reaped in growth stocks during the ultra-low interest rate regime that had prevailed since the Global Financial Crisis.And with several benchmark indexes right now at key levels, a squeeze out of current trading ranges would likely generate upside momentum.First, take a look at the highly cyclical semiconductor space, where the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) is attempting to break out of a 9-month long inverse head-and-shoulders technical formation.A breakout higher would suggest bulls retaking control after bears dictated price action for most of 2022.The PHLX Semiconductor Index is breaking the neckline of an inverse head and shoulders pattern.If the majors follow suit and manage their own respective technical breakouts, those moves would likely generate significant momentum given the duration of the consolidation under current levels. The longer an index, stock, ETF, or any other traded asset consolidates around a particular price level, the stronger moves tend to be when the price breaks higher or lower.Story continuesFor the S&amp;P 500, the December highs around 4,100 mark the upper end of the current range; the index closed at 4,016 on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Nasdaq has been constrained by 11,500 on the upper end since September, while the Dow has been stuck under 34,500 since April. These indexes closed at 11,313 and 33,743, respectively, on Wednesday.However, it would be slightly unusual for risk markets to simply rally from here given how stretched the Nasdaq is versus the Dow — as evidenced by the below chart, which dates back to the beginning of the pandemic.Dow Jones Industrial Average vs. Nasdaq CompositeThe Dow's weakness in the face of Nasdaq strength this year appears to have reached a short-term extreme, and is in the process of reversing. And extreme readings have tended to coincide with short-term highs in stocks since the bear market got under way last year. However, during the pandemic bull market of 2020-2021, these extreme readings of relative outperformance tended to do little to dent the rally.So, if the major indexes do roll over from here, tech and growth stocks would likely sell off more than cyclical and defensive names, allowing the Dow's performance relative to the Nasdaq to normalize in the short-term. For those concerned with news and fundamentals instead of the technicals, the narrative to explain this price action would likely fixate around a hawkish Fed, higher rates, and disappointing earnings du jour.Conversely, if chip stocks and the big benchmark indexes rip higher through current resistance, that would likely send the Dow-to-Nasdaq ratio sinking far below its current level.The bottom line is that stocks could very well surge from here, and the technical setup suggests we're a crucial juncture for this year's market rally.But any rally led by tech stocks is likely to be fast, furious, and short-lived.Otherwise, markets will need to consolidate and save energy for a more durable move higher another day.What to Watch TodayEconomy8:30 a.m. ET: Chicago Fed Nat Activity Index, December (-0.05 during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: GDP Annualized, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 Advance, (2.6% expected, 3.2% during prior quarter)8:30 a.m. ET: Personal Consumption, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 Advance (2.8% expected, 2.3% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: GDP Price Index, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 Advance (3.2% expected, 4.4% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Core PCE, quarter-over-quarter, Q4 Advance (3.9% expected, 4.7% prior)8:30 a.m. ET: Advance Goods Trade Balance, December (-$88.5 billion expected, -$83.3 billion during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Wholesale Inventories, month-over-month, December Preliminary (0.5% expected, 1.0% during previous month)8:30 a.m. ET: Retail Inventories, month-over-month, December (0.2% expected, 0.1% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Initial Jobless Claims, week ended Jan. 21 (205,000 expected, 190,000 during prior week)8:30 a.m. ET: Continuing Claims, week ended Jan. 14 (1.665 million expected, 1.647 million during prior week)8:30 a.m. ET: Durable Goods Orders, December Preliminary (2.5% expected, -2.1% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Durables Excluding Transportation, December Preliminary (-0.2% expected, 0.1% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Non-Defense Capital Goods Orders Excluding Aircraft, December Preliminary (-0.2% expected, 0.1% during prior month)8:30 a.m. ET: Non-Defense Capital Goods Shipments Excluding Aircraft, December Preliminary (-0.4% expected, 0.1% during prior month)10:00 a.m. ET: New Home Sales, December (612,000 expected, 640,000 during prior month)10:00 a.m. ET: New Home Sales, month-over-month, December (-4.4% expected, 5.8% during prior month)10:00 a.m. ET: Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity, January (-8 expected, -9 during prior month)EarningsAmerican Airlines (AAL), Visa (V), Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), Blackstone (BX), Comcast (CMCSA), Intel (INTC), JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Mastercard (MA), McCormick (MKC), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Southwest Airlines (LUV), T.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. drugstore chain have returned -6.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, which Walgreens falls in, has lost 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Walgreens is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share, indicating a change of -30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.7%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Walgreens is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Walgreens is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WBA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walgreens, the consensus sales estimate of $33.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.3%. The $134.65 billion and $138.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +3.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalgreens reported revenues of $33.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $1.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +0.87%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walgreens is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walgreens. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On a positive note, amid the ongoing supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business has been in high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services.Added to this, with digitization, retail industry players are significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for stalwarts within the industry like CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.However, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of drug pricing and reimbursement. Further, with a decline in the severity of COVID-19, the demand for related retail health support has decreased meaningfully, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players.Last but not least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there has been a number of new entries in this industry, increasing the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon's entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers.Story continuesOver the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potentials of this industry,  non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryIndustry Trend Remains Dismal Amid Reimbursement Pressure: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, the low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs.The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down the mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.Amazon's Entry Steals Market Share: A Business Insider report in 2021 came up with the speculation that there have been discussions about Amazon setting up standalone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Further, per the report, which cites insider sources, Amazon is exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations. Earlier, following its entry, the e-commerce giant grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market from the legacy retail drug store space.Amazon Pharmacy's omichannel performance has been significantly robust since the inception. Going by a Viseven report of Jan 5, 2023, Amazon's omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention that help to cover previous sales reductions. This has already significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. Needless to say, the speculation of Amazon planning to enter the Brick-And-Mortar space has come as a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.Online Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over. Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems.Going by a Patch report, ""Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal."" With Amazon's big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe industry's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

The company’s performance in China is likely to have affected by softening economy and COVID-19-related restrictions. We expect total international operated markets revenues in fourth-quarter 2022 to be down nearly 31.5%, year over year.However, robust performance of the U.S. segment is likely to have boosted the top line. We expect total U.S. segment revenues in fourth-quarter 2022 to be up nearly 3%, year over year.Robust comps growth is likely to drive the company’s performance. In fourth-quarter 2022, we expect comps to improve 0.8%.Digital efforts, strong marketing campaigns, robust drive-thru presence and expansion initiatives are likely to have aided the results. Moreover, increase in average check growth, menu price increases and compelling value programs also bode well.  Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcDonald's Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)Due to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to project annual results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management uses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining performance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be comparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.Ongoing ROEOngoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results.Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)GAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e., common stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to calculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to GAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or loss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying performance. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. For the three and twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no such adjustments to GAAP earnings and therefore GAAP earnings equal ongoing earnings for these periods.Note 1. Earnings Per Share SummaryXcel Energy’s 2022 earnings were $3.17 per share compared to $2.96 per share in 2021. The increase was driven by regulatory outcomes, partially offset by higher depreciation, O&amp;M expenses and interest charges. Costs for natural gas significantly increased in 2022 due to market conditions. However, fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased power and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in revenues are offset by the related variation in costs).

Regulated Utility ResultsEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used per degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or vegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial performance. However, sales true-up and decoupling mechanisms in Minnesota and Colorado predominately mitigate the positive and adverse impacts of weather.Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To calculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather variations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.Weather — Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:Three Months Ended Dec. 31Twelve Months Ended Dec. 312022 vs.Normal2021 vs.Normal2022 vs. 20212022 vs.Normal2021 vs.Normal2022 vs. 2021Retail electric$0.007$(0.026)$0.033$0.138$0.096$0.042Decoupling and sales true-up(0.007)0.011(0.018)(0.061)(0.066)0.005Electric total$—$(0.015)$0.015$0.077$0.030$0.047Firm natural gas0.018(0.030)0.0480.037(0.025)0.062Total$0.018$(0.045)$0.063$0.114$0.005$0.109Sales — Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales in 2022 compared to 2021:Three Months Ended Dec. 31PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential3.7%(0.4)%12.8%0.4%2.9%Electric C&amp;I1.3—7.02.22.5Total retail electric sales2.0(0.1)7.71.72.6Firm natural gas sales26.415.0N/A11.321.8Three Months Ended Dec. 31PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-normalizedElectric residential(3.4) %(2.6)%1.2%(1.9)%(2.3)%Electric C&amp;I0.3—6.72.12.1Total retail electric sales(0.9)(0.8)5.71.00.9Firm natural gas sales(4.5)4.5N/A2.4(1.4)Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyActualElectric residential(1.5)%(1.2)%6.5%1.1%(0.1)%Electric C&amp;I—1.78.93.33.3Total retail electric sales(0.5)0.88.42.62.3Firm natural gas sales5.418.3N/A17.310.1Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31PSCoNSP-MinnesotaSPSNSP-WisconsinXcel EnergyWeather-normalizedElectric residential(3.6)%(0.2)%0.8%—%(1.3)%Electric C&amp;I(0.3)2.18.43.43.2Total retail electric sales(1.4)1.36.92.41.8Firm natural gas sales(3.1)5.5N/A5.80.1Weather-normalized electric sales growth (decline) — year-to-datePSCo — Residential sales declined due to decreased use per customer, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in customers.

Adjusted EPS, which excludes these items, was $1.93.11Non-GAAP financial measures; see pages 3, 5, 10, 11 and 12 for explanations and reconciliations, including after-tax amounts.Quarterly Results of OperationsAg Services &amp; Oilseeds delivered substantially higher year-over-year results.Ag Services results were higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Low water conditions reduced North American export volumes, partially offset by the South American team, which executed well to deliver higher margins and volumes. Global Trade results were lower than the strong fourth quarter of 2021, with lower ocean freight results partially offset by higher results in EMEA origination and destination marketing. The business benefited from a $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Reserve, Louisiana, export facility.Crushing results were more than double those of the prior-year period. In North America, strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins. In EMEA, oil demand powered strong rapeseed margins, more than offsetting higher energy costs compared to the prior year. Expanding margins drove negative timing impacts in the quarter of approximately $40 million.RPO results were significantly higher year over year, as the business continued to execute well to meet demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the U.S. and biodiesel globally.Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the fourth quarter of 2021.Carbohydrate Solutions results were substantially lower year over year.The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher year-over-year results. The North America business delivered solid volumes and strong margins in both starches and sweeteners, partially offsetting lower ethanol margins. The EMEA team effectively managed risk and delivered improved results on better margins in a continued dynamic environment. The global wheat milling business delivered higher margins driven by solid customer demand.Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower, as higher ethanol inventory levels pressured margins, especially compared to the very strong margin environment in the fourth quarter of 2021.Nutrition delivered revenue growth of 7% for the quarter, and 11%1 on a constant currency basis. Q4 operating profits were significantly lower than the prior-year quarter’s.Human Nutrition results were lower than those of the fourth quarter of 2021. Flavors results were similar to the prior year, as strong revenue growth helped offset demand fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to see strong demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins, offset by inventory adjustments. Health &amp; Wellness was higher year over year, driven primarily by the bioactives portfolio, including the results from the Deerland acquisition.Animal Nutrition results were substantially lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower margins in amino acids driven by recovery in the global supply of lysine; pet nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially driven by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results were stronger, driven by APAC and Latin America, partially offset by the impact of softer demand in EMEA.Other Business results were significantly higher than the prior year. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, and captive insurance experienced favorable underwriting results and lower claim settlements versus the prior year.Other Items of NoteAs additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the table on page 10 includes reported earnings and EPS as well as adjusted earnings and EPS.Segment operating profit of $1.6 billion for the quarter includes charges of $71 million ($0.09 per share) primarily related to impairments, restructuring and settlement contingencies, and gains of $17 million ($0.02 per share) related to the sale of certain assets.In Corporate results, interest expense increased year over year on higher interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs were higher year over year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs, and higher costs in the company’s centers of excellence. Other Corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to higher contributions from foreign currency-related hedge activity and lower railroad maintenance expense. Corporate results also included losses related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond and severance totaling $6 million ($0.01 per share).The effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 16% compared to 21% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings in addition to lower discrete tax expense versus the prior year. The full-year tax rate was 17%.1 Constant currency revenue is ADM's GAAP revenue adjusted for the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company calculates constant currency revenue by converting its current period revenue using the prior period exchange rates and comparing the adjusted amount to its prior period reported results.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), BHP Group Ltd. BHP, Accenture plc ACN, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. EL and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Q4 Earnings Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, BHP and AccentureThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., BHP Group Ltd. and Accenture plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all the reports that came out this morning, we now have Q4 results from 72 S&amp;P 500 or 14.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 72 index members are down -7.5% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 68.1% beating EPS estimates and 65.3% beating revenues estimates.Relative to historical periods, the Q4 beats percentages are on the low side, particularly for EPS beats.The 68.1% EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members compares to 72.2% in the preceding quarter (2022 Q3) and a 20-quarter average of 78.2%. Over the preceding 20-quarter period, the EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members has been as high as 88.9% (in 2021 Q2) and as low as 61.1% (2020 Q1).The beats pecentages on the revenue side are also on the lower side relative to the preceding 20-quarter period, but not as pronounced as with the EPS beats percentages.Story continuesThis trend of lower beats percentages could change as we go through the remainder of the Q4 reporting cycle. But if it persists, it would indicate that Q4 estimates hadn't fallen as much as was warranted by underlying business conditions.Since management teams are typically quite adept at anchoring such expectations, one could even argue that the shortfall likely took even management teams by surprise.We will see how this trend evolves over the remainder of this reporting cycle, but we are not seeing its direct follow through in estimates for the current period (2023 Q1).S&amp;P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are currently expected to be down -4.3% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues. This is down from -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022.For complete details about the Q4 earnings season and the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Good Enough Start to the Q4 Earnings SeasonToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Berkshire Hathaway have gained +1.0% over the past year against the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's gain of +2.4%. The company which is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, continues to have a favorable growth outlook on the back of strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.(You can read the full research report on Birkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)BHP Group shares have outperformed the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (+8.6% vs. +1.2%). The company's iron ore production rose 2% year over year to 132 Mt in the first half of fiscal 2023 driven by record levels at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO). Its iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2023 is 249-260 Mt, indicating 1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.Iron ore prices have gained so far in 2023, as demand is expected to rise following the easing of restrictions in China amid supply concerns. Going forward, iron ore prices are expected to be supported by demand in the automotive sector, infrastructure and housing market. Copper and nickel prices will also be fueled by growing demand for electric vehicles.  BHP's investment in growth projects with focus on commodities like copper, nickel and potash will aid growth. Its efforts to make operations more efficient through technology adoption will drive earnings.(You can read the full research report on BHP Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Accenture have underperformed the Zacks Consulting Services industry over the past year (-16.6% vs. -10.8%). The company is facing pricing pressure due to significant competition from strong companies like Genpact, Cognizant and Infosys, particularly at a time of softening demand as a result of macroeconomic forces. Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Buyout-related integration risks continues to remain a concern.However, Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. The company has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships.The company's strong operating cash flow has helped it reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential.(You can read the full research report on Accenture here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Coca-Cola European and Monster Beverage are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CCEP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.43, while MNST has a forward P/E of 34.34. We also note that CCEP has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MNST currently has a PEG ratio of 3.02.Another notable valuation metric for CCEP is its P/B ratio of 3.05. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MNST has a P/B of 7.96.Based on these metrics and many more, CCEP holds a Value grade of A, while MNST has a Value grade of D.Story continuesBoth CCEP and MNST are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CCEP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Southwest had to cancel around 16,700 flights between December 21 through December 31, nearly all the flights scheduled for that time period. The U.S. Transportation Department said on Wednesday it was investigating Southwest over claims it had deceived customers by scheduling more flights that it could handle.Southwest Airlines employees assist passengers in locating their luggage after U.S. airlines, led by Southwest, canceled thousands of flights due to a massive winter storm which swept over much of the country before and during the Christmas holiday weekend, at Dallas Love Field Airport in Dallas, Texas, U.S., December 28, 2022. REUTERS/Shelby TauberSouthwest says it has offered 25,000 Rapid Rewards points to the approximately 2 million travelers who had booked flights on Southwest during the holiday period disruption.On the positive front, Southwest reported record quarterly revenue that jumped nearly 8% compared to 2019. However, revenue took a $410 million hit due to those flight cancellations in Q4.Looking ahead to Q1 2023, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said the airline is expecting another quarterly loss, though the company is encouraged by current booking trends for March 2023.“We remain intent on achieving the long-term financial goals outlined at our December 2022 Investor Day.

""It's critical.""The company's shares were down about 4.2% at $35.33 in afternoon trading.Southwest, which also reported a loss in the fourth quarter, estimates a revenue hit of between $300 million and $350 million in the first quarter.The Dallas-based carrier also expects non-fuel operating costs in the March quarter to be higher than its previous estimate, in part due to extra pay it has offered to workers for dealing with the December meltdown.It is under pressure from investors to win over customers. To mollify them, the airline has awarded customers affected by the meltdown 25,000 Rapid Rewards points, equivalent to more than $300, as a goodwill gesture.Jordan said 25% of the customers, who were issued the reward points, have already made bookings with the airline for future travel.The company expects the impact of the meltdown to fade in March, resulting in a ""solid"" profit this year.Analysts and unions have blamed Southwest's dated crew scheduling technology for its struggle to recover from a storm last month.Story continuesBut Jordan said the technology worked as designed, attributing the meltdown to the ""historic"" storm.Southwest has hired consultancy Oliver Wyman to investigate the disruption and is working with General Electric Co to upgrade its crew scheduling systems.The company's board has set up a new Operations Review Committee to oversee management following the meltdown.In the interim, the company has implemented measures to reduce the risk of a similar disruption.

This compares to earnings of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 29.03%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of lightweight composite materials would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.33, delivering a surprise of 3.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Hexcel , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, posted revenues of $429.4 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.67%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $360.3 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Hexcel shares have added about 5.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Hexcel?While Hexcel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hexcel: unfavorable.

Additionally, its presence in international markets is likely to encourage sustainable long-term growth compared with its domestically focused peers.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers has paid off well. Its online retail platform, coupled with an omnichannel strategy, is likely to be accretive to its long-term growth. It is also focused on tapping growth opportunities by helping digital brands enhance their brick-and-mortar presence.Further, the company’s efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.Going forward, an improving leasing environment is likely to benefit this retail REIT’s properties at premium locations. During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, SPG signed 983 new leases and 1,116 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less), with a fixed minimum rent across its U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio.The occupancy for Simon Property’s U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio improved 170 basis points year over year to 94.5% as of Sep 30, 2022. Also, the base-minimum rent per square foot for this portfolio was $54.80 as of Sep 30, 2022, rising from $53.91 as of Sep 30, 2021.To enhance its portfolio, Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments and has invested billions in transforming its properties. Moreover, the company capitalized on buying recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. With the brands generating a decent amount from digital sales, investments in them seem strategic for SPG.Simon Property also maintains a solid balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited the third quarter of 2022 with $8.6 billion in liquidity and a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 5.0, ahead of the required level. The company also enjoys investment-grade credit ratings, giving it favorable access to the debt market.In addition, Simon Property’s current cash flow growth is projected at 44.90% compared with the 22.59% growth estimated for the industry. With strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, the company is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have risen 18.9% in the past three months compared with its industry’s growth of 16.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has remained unchanged at $11.68 over the past month. Given the conveniences of online shopping, rising e-commerce adoption is still a concern for SPG. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.Further, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for Simon Property. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are National Retail Properties NNN and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) shareholders, since the share price is down 29% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 28%.On a more encouraging note the company has added US$203m to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Although the share price is down over three years, Leggett &amp; Platt actually managed to grow EPS by 7.0% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. We like that Leggett &amp; Platt has actually grown its revenue over the last three years. But it's not clear to us why the share price is down. It might be worth diving deeper into the fundamentals, lest an opportunity goes begging.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthThis free interactive report on Leggett &amp; Platt's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Leggett &amp; Platt, it has a TSR of -20% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Leggett &amp; Platt returned a loss of 3.0% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 6.9%. Given the total loss of 1.3% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. Whilst Baron Rothschild does tell the investor ""buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own"", buyers would need to examine the data carefully to be comfortable that the business itself is sound. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

Fourth quarter net sales were $1.98 billion in 2022 and $2.04 billion in 2021. Full year 2022 net income was $1.03 billion, or $11.03 per share, and net income of $1.04 billion, or $11.14 per share, excluding special items. Full year net sales were $8.5 billion in 2022 and $7.7 billion in 2021.Diluted earnings per share attributable to Packaging Corporation of America shareholdersThree Months EndedFull Year EndedDecember 31December 3120222021Change20222021ChangeReported Diluted EPS$2.31$2.28$0.03$11.03$8.83$2.20Special Items Expense (1)0.040.48(0.44)0.110.56(0.45)Diluted EPS excluding Special Items$2.35$2.76$(0.41)$11.14$9.39$1.75(1) For descriptions and amounts of our special items, see the schedules with this release.Reported earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 include special items primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities.Excluding special items, the $(.41) per share decrease in fourth quarter 2022 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lower volumes in the Packaging ($1.14) and Paper ($.02) segments, higher operating costs ($.48), higher freight and logistics expenses ($.13), higher depreciation expense ($.09), higher converting costs ($.06), and higher scheduled maintenance outage expenses ($.01). These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging $1.18 and Paper $.21 segments, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases $.08, lower interest expense $.04, and a lower tax rate $.01.Results were $.13 above fourth quarter guidance of $2.22 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower freight and logistics expenses, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases, and a lower tax rate.Story continuesFinancial information by segment is summarized below and in the schedules with this release.(dollars in millions)Three Months EndedFull Year EndedDecember 31December 312022202120222021Segment income (loss)Packaging$282.4$365.8$1,423.7$1,306.0Paper31.916.7103.039.1Corporate and Other(26.2)(26.8)(106.0)(103.7)$288.1$355.7$1,420.7$1,241.4Segment income (loss) excluding special itemsPackaging$284.4$362.7$1,428.7$1,307.9Paper34.421.0111.848.4Corporate and Other(26.2)(26.2)(106.0)(103.6)$292.6$357.5$1,434.5$1,252.7EBITDA excluding special itemsPackaging$392.2$460.5$1,848.6$1,688.2Paper39.426.2132.471.7Corporate and Other(22.9)(23.9)(95.5)(94.5)$408.7$462.8$1,885.5$1,665.4In the Packaging segment, shipments per day were down (8.7%) and total corrugated products shipments, with one less shipping day, were down (10.2%) versus last year’s fourth quarter. Containerboard production was 961,000 tons, and containerboard inventory was down 66,000 tons from the third quarter of 2022 and down 46,000 tons compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In the Paper segment, sales volume was down 14,000 tons compared to the third quarter of 2022 and down 15,000 tons from the fourth quarter of 2021.Commenting on reported results, Mark W. Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, said, ""Although demand in our Packaging segment was below our original expectations and we operated our system based on this lower demand, we were able to offset the negative impact through outstanding cost management and process optimization efforts at our mills and corrugated products plants. However, overall, our cost base continued to experience significant inflation compared to last year. Price and mix in our Packaging segment was better than expected, and in our Paper segment we had excellent realization from the price increase we announced in the third quarter. The scheduled annual maintenance outage and the first phase of the conversion project on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill were executed extremely well. Also, during the quarter we re-purchased over 3 million shares of our stock at an average price of $126.70 per share.""""Looking ahead as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter,"" Mr. Kowlzan continued, ""in our Packaging segment we expect box demand on a per day basis to be similar to fourth quarter levels, although we expect higher total volume with corrugated plants having four additional shipping days. Prices will move lower as a result of the recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices, and we are assuming lower export prices as well. Paper prices should move slightly higher with sales volume fairly flat. Labor costs and certain indirect costs will increase as some containerboard mill operations were temporarily idled during the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate higher labor and benefits costs and other timing-related expenses that occur at the beginning of a new year as well as higher prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda. However, we expect lower wood and recycled fiber prices, lower energy prices, and lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses. Lastly, we expect higher interest and non-operating pension expenses and a higher tax rate, but we will see some benefit from our recent share repurchases. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.23 per share.""We present various non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including diluted EPS excluding special items, segment income excluding special items and EBITDA excluding special items. We provide information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP in the schedules to this press release. We present our earnings expectation for the upcoming quarter excluding special items as special items are difficult to predict and quantify and may reflect the effect of future events. We currently anticipate special items in the first quarter of 2023 to include charges, fees, and expenses for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities at the Jackson, AL mill. We do not currently expect any additional significant special items during the first quarter; however, additional special items may arise due to first quarter events.PCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. PCA operates eight mills and 89 corrugated products plants and related facilities.Some of the statements in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements about our future earnings and financial condition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected benefits from acquisitions and restructuring activities, our industry and our business strategy.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Nasdaq, Inc. Quote Performance in DetailNasdaq’s revenues of $906 million increased 2.3% year over year. The upside can primarily be attributed to $41 million positive impact from organic growth, including positive contributions from all segments. It was partially offset by an $18 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $2 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestiture. The top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) increased 8% year over year. Annualized SaaS revenues increased 13% and represented 36% of ARR.Adjusted operating expenses were $460 million, up 6% from the year-ago period. The increase was driven by increased expenses associated with the continued investment in people and businesses and higher travel costs. It was partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expense because of lower capital markets activity and changes in FX rates.Operating margin of 49% contracted 200 basis points year over year.In 2022, the Nasdaq Stock Market featured six of the largest ten U.S. IPOs by capital raised, attracted 74% of all proceeds raised through the U.S. IPOs and welcomed 14 listing switches.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -58.5%.Revenues are expected to be $980.98 million, down 33.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.24% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hologic?For Hologic, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.37%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Hologic will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hologic would post earnings of $0.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of +32.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hologic appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a letter to shareholders, the company said it would prohibit free password sharing by the end of the first quarter, sometime in the next 10 weeks.“Today’s widespread account sharing (100M+ households) undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve Netflix, as well as build our business,” the company wrote. “While our terms of use limit use of Netflix to a household, we recognize this is a change for members who share their account more broadly.

AMGN will report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Jan 31, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 6.09%.This large biotech’s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters. The company delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.45%, on average.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmgen Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmgen Inc. price-eps-surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteAmgen’s stock has risen 14.7% in the past year against a decrease of 6.9% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to ConsiderIn the fourth quarter, volume growth from Amgen key drugs like Prolia, Repatha, Otezla, Evenity, among others is expected to have driven top-line growth. However, increasing branded and generic competition for its legacy products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neupogen, Neulasta and Sensipar are likely to have hurt the top line. Negative volume and net price trends are likely to have hurt Enbrel’s sales.Also, pricing pressure, currency headwinds and increased competition are likely to have continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products.The respective Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Repatha, Kyprolis and Evenity sales is pegged at $925 million, $528 million, $149 million, $325 million, $313 million and $210 million, respectively.Our estimates for Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Repatha, Kyprolis and Evenity sales are pegged at $941.2 million, $518.1 million, $152.2 million, $333.4 million, $305.2 million and $218.6 million, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $654 million, while our estimate is $640.2 million.In the third quarter, sales of Amgen’s new KRAS inhibitor, Lumakras, declined sequentially due to a lower net selling price due to reimbursement approval in Germany, resulting in an unfavorable price adjustment. It remains to be seen if sales improved in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumakras/Lumykras is $93 million, while our estimate is $85.6 million.Story continuesAnother new drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) is likely to have been a key contributor to profits in the fourth quarter. Amgen has a partnership with AstraZeneca AZN for Tezspire. In September, AstraZeneca announced that Tezspire was approved in Japan and Europe. Amgen and AstraZeneca share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit inventor royalty to Amgen. While AstraZeneca leads the development, Amgen leads manufacturing.For oncology biosimilars Kanjinti and Mvasi, volume decline and price erosion due to increased competition are expected to have hurt the top line.In December, Amgen entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Horizon Therapeutics HZNP for $116.5 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will add a complementary portfolio of rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to Amgen’s broad and diversified portfolio and should be accretive to the bottom line by 2024.Concurrent with the third-quarter results, Horizon said it expects Tepezza annual sales percentage growth in 2022 in the high teens and Krystexxa full-year 2022 net sales growth to be approximately 25% compared to the previous guidance of more than 20%. Amgen expects an estimated annual pre-tax cost reduction of at least $500 million by the end of the third fiscal year following completion. An update is expected on the fourth-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Amgen this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Amgen’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at $4.02 per share.

164,cd053527-c59b-347b-aab6-8ee55fa56eda,NEM,2023-01-26,Investors Heavily Search Newmont Corporation (NEM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-newmont-corporation-140002895.html,1674655202,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont Corporation (NEM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +9.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, which Newmont falls in, has gained 12.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -51.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.81 points to a change of -38.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +24% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Newmont is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Newmont, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.92 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.74 billion and $12.08 billion estimates indicate -3.9% and +2.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.59%. The EPS surprise was -6.9%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(TSE:ELEF) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 22% in the last month. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Silver Elephant Mining Silver Elephant Mining hasn't yet reported any revenue, so it's as much a business idea as an actual business. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Silver Elephant Mining will discover or develop fossil fuel before too long.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. There was already a significant chance that they would need more money for business development, and indeed they recently put themselves at the mercy of capital markets and raised equity. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). Silver Elephant Mining has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.Silver Elephant Mining had liabilities exceeding cash when it last reported, according to our data. That made it extremely high risk, in our view. But since the share price has dived 31% per year, over 5 years , it looks like some investors think it's time to abandon ship, so to speak, even though the cash reserves look a little better with the capital raising. You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Silver Elephant Mining's cash levels have changed over time.Story continuesdebt-equity-history-analysisIn reality it's hard to have much certainty when valuing a business that has neither revenue or profit.

It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Silver Elephant Mining's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. We note that Silver Elephant Mining's TSR, at 947% is higher than its share price return of -84%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Silver Elephant Mining had a tough year, with a total loss of 73%, against a market gain of about 3.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 60%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Silver Elephant Mining (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

See our latest analysis for NRG Energy NRG Energy's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, NRG Energy was paying a whopping 405% as a dividend, but this only made up 18% of its overall earnings. The business might be trying to strike a balance between returning cash to shareholders and reinvesting back into the business, but this high of a payout ratio could definitely force the dividend to be cut if the company runs into a bit of a tough spot.EPS is set to fall by 20.7% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 30%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendNRG Energy Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.36 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.51. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. NRG Energy has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 45% per annum. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While NRG Energy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We don't think NRG Energy is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

""None of these issues will be resolved quickly as we move through 2023. The January 2023 expected SAAR reading may have jumped from the month-prior reading of 13.3 million units, but the unsteady combination of consumers, inventory and economic conditions will dictate monthly new vehicle sales levels.""The S&amp;P Global Mobility auto outlook for 2023 continues to carry a countercyclical narrative: We expect production levels to continue to develop even as economic conditions are expected to deteriorate through the early stages of next year.  The advancing production levels, along with reports of sustained retail order books, recovering stock of vehicles, and a fleet sector that remains starved for product should provide some impetus to auto demand levels even as an economic recession looms.  We project 2023 calendar year volume of 14.8 million units, a 7% increase from the estimated 2022 tally.U.S. Light Vehicle SalesJan 23 (Est)Dec 22Jan 22Total Light VehicleUnits, NSA1,015,7001,263,268991,573In millions, SAAR15.513.315.1Light TruckIn millions, SAAR12.210.512.1Passenger CarIn millions, SAAR3.32.83.0Source: S&amp;P Global Mobility (Est), U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis Story continuesLight Vehicle Sales ComparisonsSustained development of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales remains a constant assumption for 2023.

The question, however, is how long this momentum will be sustained,” said Kevin Kennedy, analyst at investment research firm Third Bridge.Cross-border volume, which tracks spending on cards beyond the country of its issue and is a gauge for travel demand, was up 42% through the first three weeks of January.But that growth was largely owed to a lower base last year when the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was spreading, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.Mastercard said it expects first-quarter revenue to grow at the ""high-end of high-single digits range"", while analysts had estimated a growth of 10.7%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Downbeat forecast overshadowed the company's profit beat in the fourth quarter.Excluding one-time items, Mastercard earned $2.65 per share for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.58 per share.Net revenue climbed 12% to $5.8 billion.(Reporting by Niket Nishant in BengaluruEditing by Vinay Dwivedi)]"

It is easy to assume that most people have internet access. But the reality is that, according to the ITU's latest State of Broadband report, an estimated 2.7 billion of us do not have access to that connectivity.We kept this in mind when we were thinking about creating a virtual reality-based teacher training project for selected public-school teachers in Manila, as well as for teachers-in-training who are studying at the Philippine Normal University.A part of Ericsson's Connect To Learn initiative, the upskilling of teachers using VR is carried out alongside collaborators Qualcomm® Wireless Reach™ and Smart Communications Inc.

Zacks Market Edge Podcast Episode #1, posted on Oct 13, 2015, was called “Is it Time to Invest in Greece?”. Some of you might remember that Greece went through a tough round of austerity measures after the Great Recession and was still recovering in 2015. Additionally, while tourism was hitting all-time highs, the problem of over tourism was real.Tourist hot spot, Santorini, moved to limit the number of cruise ships it allowed in port as some of its towns were getting overwhelmed with day tourists.But the pandemic put a pause on tourism across Greece, and the world, for over 2 years.What will it look like going forward?Microsoft and Alphabet Make InvestmentsIn 2015, Tracey and Harry talked about the Greek Millennial “brain drain” to other job centers like Berlin and London, as that’s where the jobs and opportunities were.But while there is still some of that happening in 2023, the Greek government is pushing for more digital jobs. In 2023, there are global businesses coming to Greece.In 2020, Microsoft MSFT announced plans to open a data center in Greece, and in Nov 2022, Alphabet GOOGL announced it was also investing in the country with the possibility of hiring as many as 20,000 by the end of the decade.Story continuesMicrosoft has over 200,000 employees worldwide while Alphabet has about 187,000.Tourism Still the Leading IndustryBut tourism is still the leading industry, both on mainland Greece and the islands.1.      Airbnb ABNBAirbnb is now a big business globally, especially in Greece. Harry discussed how some investors are buying up entire buildings in, and around Athens, to put them on Airbnb.Shares of Airbnb have plunged in the last year, however. They’re down 33.6% during that time but they’ve rallied in the last month, adding 22.1%.Airbnb still isn’t cheap on a forward P/E basis. It trades at 37.6x.Should you be investing in Airbnb for its international growth?2.      Expedia Group, Inc. EXPEExpedia has been around for several decades, but now that the global travel industry has reopened, the online travel company is back in the spotlight.Expedia shares are also down big in the last year, falling 33.7%. And they, too, have rallied in the last month as the airlines report strong bookings through the summer months, an indication that people are still eager to travel. Shares are up 33% during that time.But Expedia IS actually cheap on a forward P/E basis, with a P/E of just 12.6.Should Expedia be on your short list as a way to invest in global growth?3.      Booking Holdings Inc. BKNGBooking Holdings is one of the world’s largest online travel companies. You can book Greek hotels on it.Over the last year, shares of Booking are actually up, but just 2.4%. In the last month, like Expedia and Airbnb, Booking shares have soared 22%.Booking is more expensive than Expedia, on a P/E basis, with a forward P/E of 20.Is Booking getting ready to break out in 2023 as global travel picks up momentum?What Else do you Need to Know About Cashing in on Greece’s Growth?

HAE.Time to Pick Up These 3 Top Relative Price Strength StocksWe know that the market witnessed a broad-based decline in 2022 owing to a high-interest-rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed to combat a 40-year high inflation. But as we have entered 2023, a very early sign of a rebound is visible on Wall Street, with peak inflation seemingly behind us. As proof of this, the S&amp;P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — has crept above 4K for the first time in several weeks.In particular, the market participants see a pending 25 basis-point interest rate hike next week as a sign of slowing Fed tightening, providing a much-needed respite to the economy. Yet, despite the central bank's softening stance, traders and investors continue to see headwinds in the form of softness in consumer spending, worries over a tight labor market and disappointing fourth-quarter 2022 earnings numbers. As such, extremely volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock's potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it's essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter's (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are the three stocks that made it through the screen:Clarivate Plc: The company provides information and analytic products worldwide, including scientific, patient and academic research to the top pharmaceutical firms. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this London-based firm indicates 12.5% year-over-year earnings per share growth. CLVT has a VGM Score of B.Clarivate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 9.4%, on average. CLVT shares have lost 33.6% in a year.Expedia Group: One of the largest online travel companies in the world, Expedia Group's web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases and travel experience sharing. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Seattle, WA-based company indicates 350.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth. EXPE has a VGM Score of A.Expedia Group beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. Over the past 90 days, the company saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 move up 4.8%. EXPE stock has lost 32.5% in a year.Haemonetics Corp.: The company provides blood management solutions to customers encompassing blood and plasma collectors, hospitals and health care providers globally.

(Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters)On a regional basis, the South saw its population grow fastest, jumping by 1.1%, or roughly 1.4 million people over the last year.The South benefited from domestic migration that saw 870,000 leave their state in another region for the South, a trend some industry experts have dubbed the ""Sun Belt migration.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.By state, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, South Carolina, and Tennessee were the biggest gainers in terms of net population growth, according to Bank of America.Florida, Texas, and North Carolina also saw the largest increases in net domestic migration — or people moving from one state to another — with these states adding 319,000, 231,000, and 100,000 new residents from other states, respectively.In contrast, some 343,000 Californians fled the state for another while 300,000 New Yorkers did the same. Illinois saw the third-highest number of net domestic population outflows, with 142,000 people leaving the state for another.Americans flocking to the Sun Belt region is not a new trend, but was expedited during the pandemic. The option to work remotely gave a number of residents a reason to look for more affordable housing, better weather, and tax incentives.A report from moving company U-Haul found that Texas, Florida and the Carolinas were the preferred one-way destinations last year.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Separately, another indicator of migration, the USPS migration index, found a slowdown in markets homebuilders like D.R.

Horton and PulteGroup.Earlier this year, Jadrosich and his team upgraded shares of three homebuilder stocks, including Pulte, Lennar (LEN), and Toll Brothers (TOL), with the view that lower input costs, moderating interest rates, and a ""home price correction rather than a crash"" would bolster these stocks in 2023.Over the last six months, shares of all three companies are up more than 15%.—Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

PHM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Earnings and revenues increased 47.8% and 13.4% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.It is to be noted that PHM surpassed earnings estimates in 21 of the trailing 24 quarters.PulteGroup, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has increased to $2.88 from $2.87 per share over the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 14.7% increase from the year-ago earnings of $2.51 per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $4.60 billion, suggesting 5.6% year-over-year growth.Factors to NoteThe U.S. housing market has been navigating through a challenging time comprising higher rates environment, continued supply-chain issues, material cost inflation and higher wages. Additionally, the uncertain economic scenario has been prompting moderation in housing demand.Nonetheless, PulteGroup has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have increased in the fourth quarter, given a prudent land investment strategy, higher pricing and affordable product offerings.However, unprecedented supply-chain challenges and labor shortages are likely to have created hurdles for builders to fulfill orders and deliveries, thereby impacting revenues and orders.PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be 8,000, indicating a decline from 8,611 homes delivered a year ago. The decrease reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancelation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on Florida operations. It expects a higher average selling price or ASP for the quarter in the range of $560,000-$570,000, suggesting an increase from $490,000 in the year-ago period.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $4.52 billion suggests an increase of 6.1% from $4.26 billion a year ago, courtesy of higher ASP.From the margin perspective, input cost inflation and high costs associated with labor and transportation are expected to have weighed on margins to some extent. That said, higher pricing and prudent cost-saving efforts are likely to have mitigated the risks.Given these cost price dynamics, the company expects homebuilding gross margins to expand 120 bps to 28% for fourth-quarter 2022 from the year-ago period.SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) for the quarter are expected to be in the 9.2-9.5% range. The figure was 8.7% a year ago on an adjusted basis and 8.2%, including the $23 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PulteGroup for the quarter to be reported.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Johnson &amp; Johnson in FocusJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) is headquartered in New Brunswick, and is in the Medical sector. The stock has seen a price change of -4.72% since the start of the year. The world's biggest maker of health care products is paying out a dividend of $1.13 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.69% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.32% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.63%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.52 is up 1.6% from last year. Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.91%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson's current payout ratio is 45%. This means it paid out 45% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.JNJ is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $10.22 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 0.69%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, JNJ is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TRC's offer price of $77.25 per share in cash is approximately 4.5% lower than the $80.91 closing price of Medtronic ordinary shares on January 20, 2023, the last closing price prior to commencement of the offer.Medtronic does not recommend or endorse TRC's unsolicited below-market mini-tender offer. Further, because the offer is at a price significantly below the current market price of Medtronic ordinary shares, Medtronic recommends that shareholders not tender their shares. Medtronic is not affiliated or associated with TRC, its mini-tender offer, or the mini-tender offer documentation.Medtronic urges shareholders to obtain current market quotations for their shares, to consult with their broker or financial advisor, and to exercise caution with respect to TRC's mini-tender offer. Medtronic recommends that shareholders who have not responded to TRC's offer take no action. Medtronic also recommends that shareholders who have already tendered their shares withdraw those shares in accordance with TRC's offering documents prior to the expiration of the offer. The offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. New York City time on Wednesday, February 22, 2023, unless the offer is extended or earlier terminated.TRC has made similar below-market mini-tender offers for other companies' shares. Mini-tender offers are devised to seek less than 5% of a company's stock, thereby avoiding many filing, disclosure and procedural requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The SEC has cautioned investors that some bidders making mini-tender offers at below-market prices are ""hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.""

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Novo Nordisk (NVO) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.89 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on February 1, 2023.Novo Nordisk's Earnings ESP sits at 11.25%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.80.NVO is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Medtronic (MDT).Medtronic, which is readying to report earnings on February 21, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.28 a share, and MDT is 27 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic is $1.26, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 1.47%.Story continuesNVO and MDT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Our estimate for the same was pegged at $1.75 billion.Reported AFFO per share compared favorably with the year-ago period’s $1.77.

This compares to FFO of $1.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.09%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this operator of wireless communications towers would post FFO of $1.83 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.85, delivering a surprise of 1.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Crown Castle , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.76 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.65 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Crown Castle shares have added about 7.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Crown Castle?While Crown Castle has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Crown Castle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.08 on $1.84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.63 on $7.16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

We have led the U.S. tower industry in growth during the initial phase of 5G development over the last two years, and I believe our comprehensive infrastructure offering of towers, small cells and fiber positions us to continue to drive substantial growth in the future. I am excited about the continued momentum we see across our business, which is driving another year of expected strong growth in 2023, including 5% organic revenue growth in our Towers segment and a doubling of small cell deployments to 10,000 nodes with more than half of those nodes to be collocated on existing fiber.""Story continuesRESULTS FOR THE YEARThe table below sets forth select financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. ActualPrevious2022OutlookMidpoint(b)ActualComparedto PreviousOutlookMidpoint(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)20222021 ChangeChange %Site rental revenues$6,289$5,719 $57010%$6,265$24Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,675$1,158(c)$51745%$1,694$(19)Income (loss) from continuing operations per share—diluted$3.86$2.67(c)$1.1945%$3.90$(0.04)Adjusted EBITDA(a)$4,340$3,816 $52414%$4,352$(12)AFFO(a)$3,200$3,013 $1876%$3,201$(1)AFFO per share(a)$7.38$6.95 $0.436%$7.36$0.02(a) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for further information and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to income (loss) from continuing operations, as computed in accordance with GAAP.(b) As issued October 19, 2022.

Income from continuing operations for full year 2022 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion for full year 2021.Adjusted EBITDA. Full year 2022 Adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 billion compared to $3.8 billion for full year 2021, representing 14% growth, primarily as a result of the growth in site rental revenues and higher services contribution.AFFO and AFFO per share. Full year 2022 AFFO was $3.2 billion, or $7.38 per share, representing growth from the full year 2021 of 6%.Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during the year were $1.3 billion, comprised of $95 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $1.2 billion of discretionary capital expenditures. Discretionary capital expenditures during the year primarily included approximately $1.0 billion attributable to Fiber and approximately $174 million attributable to Towers.Common stock dividend.

In January 2023, Crown Castle issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a five-year maturity and a coupon of 5.000%. Net proceeds from the senior notes offering were used to repay a portion of the indebtedness under the existing revolving credit facility and pay related fees and expenses.“We believe the positive operating trends across our business will continue as we navigate higher interest rates and the previously disclosed rationalization of a portion of Sprint's legacy network that will impact our growth in the near-term,"" stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle’s Chief Financial Officer. ""Looking beyond these near-term headwinds, we are excited to leverage our comprehensive portfolio of infrastructure offerings to generate long-term growth in line with our target of 7% to 8% annual growth in dividends per share. We have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity position to pursue investment opportunities that are consistent with our strategy and support our ability to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of dividends and growth. Following our successful bond offering earlier this month, we have an investment grade balance sheet with more than 85% fixed rate debt, a weighted average maturity across our debt of over eight years, limited debt maturities through 2024 and approximately $5.5 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facility.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"")).Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts (""REITs"").In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide segment site rental gross margin, segment services and other gross margin and segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as site rental revenues and capital expenditures.Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock (in periods where applicable)) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (1) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations or rent free periods, the revenues or expenses are recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment.FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily real estate depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to income (loss) from continuing operations computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, core leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well as to forecast future results. Separately, we are also disclosing Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as adjusted for impact of Sprint Cancellations, which is outside of ordinary course, to provide further insight into our results of operations and underlying trends. Management believes that identifying the impact for Sprint Cancellations provides increased transparency and comparability across periods. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings (including as adjusted for impact of Sprint Cancellations) is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP.Net Debt is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our overall debt position and future debt capacity. Management uses Net Debt in assessing our leverage. Net Debt is not meant as an alternative measure of debt and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing our leverage.We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and stock-based compensation expense.Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenues, straight-lined expenses, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (credits), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, less sustaining capital expenditures.AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as income (loss) from continuing operations plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends (in periods where applicable), and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to common stockholders.FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings. We define Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings as the sum of the change in site rental revenues related to core leasing activity, escalators and payments for Sprint Cancellations (for periods beginning in 2023), less non-renewals of tenant contracts and non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations (for periods beginning in 2023). Additionally, Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings adjusted for impact of Sprint Cancellations reflects Organic Contribution to Site Rental Billings less payments for Sprint Cancellations, plus non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations.Net Debt. We define Net Debt as (1) debt and other long-term obligations and (2) current maturities of debt and other obligations, excluding unamortized adjustments, net; less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.Segment MeasuresSegment site rental gross margin. We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental costs of operations.Segment services and other gross margin. We define segment services and other gross margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other costs of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other costs of operations.Segment operating profit. We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable.Other CalculationsSite rental billings. We define site rental billings as site rental revenues exclusive of the impacts from (1) straight-lined revenues, (2) amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (3) contribution from recent acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of such acquisitions.Core leasing activity. We define core leasing activity as site rental revenues growth from tenant additions across our entire portfolio and renewals or extensions of tenant contracts, exclusive of (1) the impacts from both straight-lined revenues and amortization of prepaid rent in accordance with GAAP and (2) payments for Sprint Cancellations, where applicable.Non-renewals. We define non-renewals of tenant contracts as the reduction in site rental revenues as a result of tenant churn, terminations and, in limited circumstances, reductions of existing lease rates, exclusive of non-renewals associated with Sprint Cancellations, where applicable.Discretionary capital expenditures. We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants) and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as discretionary capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures.Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures:Reconciliation of Historical Adjusted EBITDA:  For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended (in millions) December 31,2022 December 31,2021 December 31,2022 December 31,2021 Income (loss) from continuing operations $413  $353 $1,675  $1,158 (a)Adjustments to increase (decrease) income (loss) from continuing operations:         Asset write-down charges  8   12  34   21  Acquisition and integration costs  1   —  2   1  Depreciation, amortization and accretion  431   415  1,707   1,644  Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments  4   4  16   18  Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(b)  192   164  699   657  (Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations  —   —  28   145  Interest income  (2)  —  (3)  (1) Other (income) expense  5   4  10   21  (Benefit) provision for income taxes  2   1  16   21  Stock-based compensation expense  36   31  156   131       Adjusted EBITDA(c)(d) $1,090  $984 $4,340  $3,816  Reconciliation of Current Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA:  Full Year 2023(in millions) Outlook(f)Income (loss) from continuing operations $1,596to$1,676Adjustments to increase (decrease) income (loss) from continuing operations:    Asset write-down charges $26to$36Acquisition and integration costs $0to$8Depreciation, amortization and accretion $1,712to$1,807Amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments $15to$17Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs(e) $814to$859(Gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations $0to$0Interest income $(4)to$(3)Other (income) expense $2to$7(Benefit) provision for income taxes $16to$24Stock-based compensation expense $165to$169     Adjusted EBITDA(c)(d) $4,449to$4,494(a) Does not reflect the impact related to the ATO Settlement (as defined in the April 2021 8-K), which is attributable to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2021 as discussed in the April 2021 8-K.(b) See reconciliation of ""Components of Interest Expense"" for a discussion of non-cash interest expense.(c) See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations"" for a discussion of our definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

All future dividends are subject to declaration by our board of directors.Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and the following:Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.Failure to timely, efficiently and safely execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the rights to land under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.Cybersecurity breaches or other information technology disruptions could adversely affect our operations, business and reputation.Our business may be adversely impacted by climate-related events, natural disasters, including wildfires, and other unforeseen events.The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site.As used in this release, the term ""including,"" and any variation thereof, means ""including without limitation.""CROWN CASTLE INC.CONDENSED

The new indication treats and controls Asian longhorned ticks, which are an invasive Ixodid species located across more than one-third of the U.S1,2.BRAVECTO Chews for Dogs is the first and only U.S. product labeled for the treatment and control of Asian longhorned tick infestations. These ticks have the potential to quickly become an important tick species within pet populations and have been known to carry various viral, bacterial and protozoal agents. This product label expansion is an important addition to the company’s BRAVECTO product portfolio, which are extended duration flea and tick protection products that offer broad-spectrum, comprehensive parasite protection for dogs.""The approval of this additional BRAVECTO use builds on the strong foundation and body of scientific evidence that we have established over the years with our broad-spectrum comprehensive line of parasite protection products,"" said Holger Lehmann, DVM, PhD, vice president, Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Merck Animal Health.

246,044027ef-3dcb-390a-b46f-741f211276aa,MOS,2023-01-26,Agricultural Chemical Stocks With Big Upside Potential For Investors in 2023,News Direct,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agricultural-chemical-stocks-big-upside-100000580.html,1674727200,STORY,"['CTA-PA', 'CTA-PB', 'CTVA', 'FSI', 'IPI', 'MOS']","[Naples --News Direct-- RazorPitch Agro Chemical StocksThe global population is reaching eight billion this year, the UN says. The pressure is on to grow crops more efficiently to feed everyone. Farmers need to apply agricultural chemicals to fertilizers to improve crop yield and prevent phosphorous and nitrogen runoff and evaporation.The war in Ukraine is disrupting the global food chain, creating even greater demand for farmers to produce more crops.The result for investors is a spike in the global agricultural chemicals market to an estimated $292 billion by 2030, researchers Statista and Next Move Strategy Consulting say.For investors, this sector is soaring with growth opportunities, especially in undervalued stocks.Opportunities Ahead In Agricultural Chemical StocksAmong the sector's stocks are Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE: IPI), Corteva, Inc. (NYSE: CTVA), The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) and Flexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI).All of this spells an upside opportunity for investors in agricultural chemical stocks. Here are some notables:Corteva, Inc. (NYSE: CTVA) is a pure play agricultural company which sees a bright future for the role of biologicals improving the efficiency of farmers. Chuck Magro, CEO of CTVA, says, “Biologicals provide farmers with sustainably-advantaged tools that complement crop protection technologies, and collectively, can work to address global challenges around food security and climate change.”CTVA has affirmed guidance for full year 2022 net sales at $17.2 billion-$17.5 billion. In Q3 2022 ended September 30, the Company reported volume of $2.78 billion. It includes a YTD 2022 12% overall increase, including a 22% jump in crop protection net sales. Corteva's YTD nine month sales reached $13.63 billion. CTVA will announce its Q4 2022 and full year 2022 results on February 1.CTVA late last year signed a purchase agreement to buy Stoller Group for $1.2 billion in cash. Stoller is an independent biological company with a global 2022 forecast of some $400 million in sales in a 60 country target market. CTVA says Stoller brings ""attractive growth and operating margins” to CTVA.Story continuesIntrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE: IPI) is a favorite of large, institutional investors. They own some 60% of this stock. ""This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors,” according to Simply Wall St. Eight of its top shareholders own 50% of IPI. The general public, or retail investors, own some 12%. Even the CEO owns 3.4% of total shares outstanding.In its Investor Presentation in 2022, IPI says its management team and members of its Board own some 20% of its common shares outstanding.Why? This is a $421 million market cap company trading at a PE (TTM) ratio of just 1.44. For Q3 2022, IPI’s net income rose to $13.1 million. This is a $9.1 million improvement from the same quarter in the prior year. Sales increased in Q3 to $74.8 million, a $15.6 million gain from the comparable quarter in 2021. For full year 2021, IPI net income hit $249.8 million.MOS Sees 2023 As A ‘Strong Year’ For Nutrient ApplicationsThe Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) is a producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop fertilizers for the global agriculture industry. It sees 2023 as a ‘strong year’ for nutrient application supported by healthy crop prices and grower economics. With a PE ratio (TTM) of only 4.68, MOS enjoys a market cap of $16.3 billion.In its 10Q SEC filing on November 2, 2022, MOS reported sales for its three months ended September 30 of $5.35 billion, a 56.5% increase from its $3.4 billion the comparable period the previous year. Net income attributable to Mosaic rose dramatically to $841.7 million in the 2022 quarter from $371.9 million the previous year.The company cited tightness in global supply and the war in Ukraine for a disruption of fertilizer and agricultural commodities that resulted in a rise in prices for its products. Additionally, it mentioned Chinese reductions in phosphate exports on impacting the global fertilizer market.FSI: An Undervalued Growth Stock Opportunity For InvestorsFlexible Solutions International (NYSE: FSI) offers investors who are willing to take a little more risk and get into a stock early within the agricultural chemicals sector a special opportunity. FSI is a developer and manufacturer of biodegradable polymers for oil extraction, detergent ingredients, and water treatment, as well as crop nutrient availability chemistry.One of FSI’s goals is to feed the world’s growing population more efficiently. It is doing so profitably and reporting annual sales growth. FSI’s volume expanded to $45.7 million in 2022 from $34.4 million in 2021, a 33% jump. In 2020, FSI’s volume was $31.4 million, 10% higher than the prior year.FSI’s net profit was $3.4 million in 2021,16% higher than its $2.9 million in 2020. Complete 2022 financials will be released on March 31. FSI stock is trading at a PE ratio (TTM) of 9.81.""Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, FSI feels like a great value stock right now,” concludes analyst firm Zacks. Investor Place lists FSI as one of its ‘hyper-growth stocks with 10x potential in 2023.”The NanoChem Solutions, Inc. Division of FSI, with proprietary agricultural products EX-10, Sun Savr 30 and Sun 27, are specialty chemicals that successfully commercialize technology. They mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and evaporation. This means farmers can deliver more efficient production and improved crop yields.CONCLUSION Agricultural specialty chemicals stocks are in a growth sector attracting investors with its undervalued stocks. FSI offers investors an early upside to participate in this category by taking a little more risk. Investors should take a closer look at FSI’s performance. It is trading at a PE (TTM) ratio of less than ten. The company reported a 33% increase in sales for 2022. For full year 2021, it reported a 16% rise in profits on a 10% volume gain. For multiple years, FSI has generated continued increases in both volume and net profit. This is a Green company that commercializes its specialty chemicals and offers proprietary and innovative polymer biodegradable additives. FSI may be an opportunity for investors focused on ESG and socially conscious investing.Razorpitch Inc. is a marketing communications and investor relations firm serving private, pre-IPO, and public companies.

247,f656c3b9-6fe0-3f96-a7af-3d04771768eb,MOS,2023-01-26,UPDATE 2-Fertilizer producer Mosaic says stockpiles too high to restart Canadian mine,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fertilizer-producer-mosaic-says-202541412.html,1674678341,STORY,['MOS'],"[(Adds CEO comment on Russia and Belarus, comments from analysts)By Rod NickelWINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Fertilizer producer Mosaic Co does not currently see the right market conditions to restart its idled Canadian potash mine, with high inventories in the United States and Brazil and cold weather slowing trains from Canada, Chief Executive Joc O’Rourke said on Wednesday.Mosaic Co curtailed potash production in December at its Colonsay, Saskatchewan, mine, but said then that it expected to restart in early 2023.""It's just a matter of starting to see the inventories coming down,"" O'Rourke said in a Reuters interview. ""The last thing we want to do is start it up, run it for a month-and-a-half and have to shut it down again.""O'Rourke declined to be more specific on timing for restarting the mine, which was producing at an annual rate of 1.3 million tonnes.""I think once we get through the first quarter, we can certainly be moving a lot more product,"" he said. ""But I'm being cautious about what to say until we see that movement.""Spring is North America's busiest time of year for potash applications.Potash producers are banking on a return to stable prices in 2023 after disappointing demand late last year in the United States and Brazil. Potash is a key nutrient for corn and other crops, and elevated prices earlier in 2022 contributed to food inflation.Prices had initially spiked after Russia invaded Ukraine and prompted Western countries to issue sanctions on Russia's banking system that have slowed its potash exports.O'Rourke said he sees strong demand this year once inventories decline.U.S. farmers are expected to plant more corn, which consumes much fertilizer, with prices attractive.""U.S. farmers are in really good shape,"" Scotiabank analyst Ben Isaacson said. ""There's no reason we shouldn't see at least partial recovery in potash demand, especially if we get some of the (extra) corn acres.""Story continuesA key variable is whether Russia and Belarus, another sanctioned potash producer, find ways to export more.O'Rourke expects both will export about the same volume this year as last.But RBC analyst Andrew Wong estimated that Belarussian and Russian potash operating rates would increase in 2023 by 10 percentage points to 50% and 80% respectively of their pre-war levels.

(NYSE: ROK) today reported first quarter fiscal 2023 results.""Our strong execution and continued focus on supply chain resiliency helped Rockwell exceed our expectations in the quarter, with earnings growing double digits year over year. In addition to a gradually improving supply chain environment, we are encouraged by the continued strength of our customers’ demand across all business segments and regions,"" said Blake Moret, Chairman and CEO.Fiscal Q1 2023 Financial ResultsFiscal 2023 first quarter sales were $1,981 million, up 6.7% from $1,857 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Organic sales increased 9.9%, currency translation decreased sales by 4.0%, and acquisitions increased sales by 0.8%.Fiscal 2023 first quarter Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $384 million or $3.31 per share, compared to $242 million or $2.05 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increases in Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS are primarily due to fair value adjustments recognized in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 in connection with our investment in PTC (the ""PTC adjustments""). Fiscal 2023 first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.46, up 15% compared to $2.14 in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher input costs.Pre-tax margin was 23.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 15.2% in the same period last year. The increase in pre-tax margin was primarily due to the PTC adjustments.Story continuesTotal segment operating earnings were $401 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up 12.9% from $355 million in the same period of fiscal 2022. Total segment operating margin was 20.2% compared to 19.1% a year ago primarily due to positive price/cost and higher sales volume partially offset by higher investment spend.Cash flow generated by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $66.3 million, compared to $(12.0) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Free cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $42.1 million, compared to $(49.1) million in the same period last year. Increases in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily driven by higher pre-tax income.Fiscal Year 2023 OutlookThe table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2023. Our updated guidance reflects first quarter performance and record backlog. It also assumes a gradually improving supply chain environment.Updated GuidancePrior GuidanceReported sales growth10.0% - 14.0%7.5% - 11.5%Organic sales growth11.0% - 15.0%9.0% - 13.0%Inorganic sales growth~1.0%~1.0%Currency translation~(2.0)%~(2.5)%Diluted EPS$10.99 - $11.79$9.54 - $10.34Adjusted EPS$10.70 - $11.50$10.20 - $11.00""Automation has never been more important in solving our customers’ greatest challenges, and Rockwell is front and center as a trusted partner in these dynamic times. We look forward to another year of delivering strong growth and new customer value,"" Moret continued.Following is a discussion of first quarter results for our business segments.Intelligent DevicesIntelligent Devices first quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $936 million, an increase of 4.0% compared to $900 million in the same period last year. Organic sales increased 6.6%, currency translation decreased sales by 4.1%, and the acquisition of CUBIC increased sales by 1.5%. Segment operating earnings were $209 million compared to $213 million in the same period last year. Segment operating margin decreased to 22.4% from 23.7% a year ago. The decrease from prior year includes higher investment spend, and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by the positive impact from higher price/cost.Software &amp; ControlSoftware &amp; Control first quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $573 million, an increase of 11.6% compared to $514 million in the same period last year. Organic sales increased 15.5% and currency translation decreased sales by 3.9%. Segment operating earnings were $167 million compared to $118 million in the same period last year. Segment operating margin increased to 29.2% from 22.9% a year ago, driven by positive price/cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex, and higher sales.Lifecycle ServicesLifecycle Services first quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $472 million, an increase of 6.4% compared to $443 million in the same period last year. Organic sales increased 10.2%, currency translation decreased sales by 4.2%, and acquisitions increased sales by 0.4%. Segment operating earnings were $24.3 million compared to $24.5 million in the same period last year. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.2% from 5.5% a year ago.Supplemental InformationARR - Organic ARR grew 14% compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Corporate and other - Fiscal 2023 first quarter Corporate and other expense was $27.3 million compared to $29.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization - Fiscal 2023 first quarter Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense was $26.0 million, down $0.1 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Tax - On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 19.1% compared to 15.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 17.1% compared to 15.3% in the prior year.Share repurchases - During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $156 million. At December 31, 2022, $1.1 billion remained available under our existing share repurchase authorization.Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) - ROIC was 16.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared to 20.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease is driven by higher invested capital and discrete one-time tax benefits in the prior year partially offset by higher pre-tax income.DefinitionsNon-GAAP Measures - Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, and ROIC are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.Organic ARR - Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a key metric that enables measurement of progress in growing our recurring revenue business. It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in the current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. Organic ARR growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog.Conference CallA conference call to discuss the quarterly results will be held at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on January 26, 2023.

Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021:Three Months Ended December 31,20222021Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesNorth America$1,178.9$1.2$(8.1)$1,185.8$1,100.7EMEA372.811.7(40.9)402.0354.7Asia Pacific296.52.7(29.7)323.5278.9Latin America132.8—2.1130.7123.0Total$1,981.0$15.6$(76.6)$2,042.0$1,857.3The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021:Three Months Ended December 31,20222021Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesIntelligent Devices$936.2$13.7$(37.6)$960.1$900.3Software &amp; Control573.3—(20.2)593.5513.9Lifecycle Services471.51.9(18.8)488.4443.1Total$1,981.0$15.6$(76.6)$2,042.0$1,857.3The following is a reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales growth for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021:Three Months Ended December 31, 2022Reported Sales GrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic Sales GrowthNorth America7.1 %0.1 %(0.7) %7.7 %EMEA5.1 %3.3 %(11.5) %13.3 %Asia Pacific6.3 %1.0 %(10.7) %16.0 %Latin America8.0 %— %1.7 %6.3 %Total6.7 %0.8 %(4.0) %9.9 %The following is a reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales growth for our operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2021:Three Months Ended December 31, 2022Reported Sales GrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic Sales GrowthIntelligent Devices4.0 %1.5 %(4.1) %6.6 %Software &amp; Control11.6 %— %(3.9) %15.5 %Lifecycle Services6.4 %0.4 %(4.2) %10.2 %Total6.7 %0.8 %(4.0) %9.9 %ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax RateAdjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit, purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to Rockwell Automation, change in fair value of investments, and Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, including their respective tax effects.We believe that adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period.

ROK, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Rockwell Automation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ROK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.90 per share for ROK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ROK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.76% heading into earnings season.Rockwell Automation, Inc.

""We felt like it was not as comprehensive and robust as it could have been.""The MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion, led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane that was lifted by regulators after Boeing made software and pilot training changes. Boeing declined to comment Tuesday.The NTSB was not given a chance to review or comment on Ethiopia's final report before it was made public last month, a violation of rules overseen by the United Nations’ Montreal-based aviation agency, ICAO, Homendy said.""It's unprecedented -- under ICAO we get a right to review the report and to provide comment,"" Homendy said.The NTSB comments released in December were in response to an earlier draft the board reviewed.The NTSB said earlier Ethiopian inspectors investigating the cause of the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines' crash that killed 157 people did not pay enough attention to crew training and emergency procedures in their report.The EAIB blamed the accident on ""uncommanded"" inputs from Boeing's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS.The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Its final report last month focused solely on MCAS as the ""most probable cause"" and listed several contributing factors stemming from the plane's design or manufacturer procedures.Story continuesThe inputs, which were caused by faulty data from an angle of attack (AOA) sensor, sent the plane's nose down repeatedly, leading to loss of control as the pilots tried to deal with several warnings in the cabin, the report said.The NTSB said the Ethiopian report's finding that aircraft electrical problems caused erroneous AOA output was ""unsupported by evidence."" The NTSB said it found the erroneous sensor output was likely caused by a bird strike soon after take-off from Addis Ababa.FRENCH CRITICISMThe NTSB added that the Ethiopia report's finding that MCAS documentation for flight crews was ""misleading since Boeing had provided the information to all 737 MAX operators four months before the Ethiopian Airlines crash.""France's BEA air accident investigation agency, which read and analyzed the black boxes at the request of Ethiopia, has also taken issue with aspects of the Ethiopian report.It said earlier this month ""the operational and crew performance aspects are insufficiently addressed"".Ethiopian Airlines has consistently said its crew were not to blame and died trying to counter a flawed system. Boeing has apologized for MAX crashes and agreed to a settlement including a fine and compensation, while pledging internal safety reforms.Under international rules, the country where an air accident happens has sole control of the probe and official reports.It is not unusual for foreign agencies to append dissenting comments but it is rare for them to voice objections separately.The work of such civil safety agencies is not to decide liability, but instead to make recommendations that could prevent future accidents.The BEA said it agreed with Ethiopian findings on MCAS but that analyzing crew performance would prompt wider safety lessons.

He said their veiws were ""a good reminder.. of how important safety is for all of us.""The planemaker is expected to enter a not guilty plea on Thursday as is standard in deferred prosecution cases. The Justice Department in 2021 agreed to seek dismissal of the charge after the three-year agreement if Boeing complies with all terms.O'Connor ruled in October that people killed in the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes are legally considered ""crime victims.""More than a dozen relatives of people killed plan to speak at the arraignment Thursday. The relatives said in the filing Boeing had ""committed the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""Both Boeing and the Justice Department oppose reopening the deferred prosecution agreement, which included $500 million in victim compensation, a $243.6 million fine and $1.7 billion in compensation to airlines.

Revenues are expected to be $118.97 million, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Mayville Engineering, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Quanta Services (PWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Quanta Services' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Quanta Services' main business drivers.Quanta is a leading national provider of specialty contracting services, and one of the largest contractors serving the transmission and distribution sector of the North American electric utility industry. Quanta has operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and other selected international markets.Starting from fourth-quarter 2021, Quanta reports results under three reportable segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions, and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions.The Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment (accounting for 58.7% of 2021 revenues) provides network solutions to customers in the electric power industry. Services performed include design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution networks, and sub-station facilities; emergency restoration services; installation of “smart grid” technology on electric power networks; and communications infrastructure services.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (14.1%) provides solutions to customers involved in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services include design, installation, repair and maintenance of oil and gas transmission and distribution systems, and related trenching and directional boring services. Also, this segment provides pipeline protection services, high-pressure and critical-path turnaround services to the downstream and midstream energy markets.Story continuesRenewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment (27.2%) provides infrastructure solutions to clients involved in the renewable energy and/or related infrastructure. This segment provides services related to engineering, procurement, new construction, upgrade, and repair and maintenance of utility-scale wind, solar and hydropower generation facilities as well as battery storage facilities.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Quanta Services ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $5,120.31, or a gain of 412.03%, as of January 25, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 168.72% and the price of gold went up 12.22% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for PWR.Quanta's shares have outperformed the industry this year. The company has been witnessing notable revenue growth in each segments. It witnessed a solid total backlog of $20.87 billion in the third quarter. The company remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development, with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum. More demand for infrastructure solutions that help support customers' energy-transition initiatives and modernization will continue to provide multi-year growth opportunities for Quanta. However, lower operating margins, regulatory challenges and project delays are potential headwinds.The stock is up 5.24% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2022.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, Live Nation Entertainment Inc. LYV, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and NIKE Inc. NKE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Enhance Your PortfolioThe consumer discretionary sector suffered the most in terrible 2022. The inflation rate was at a 40-year high. In order to combat mounting inflation, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate to its highest level in 15 years and its strict monetary tightening raised the risk-free market interest rate to a two-decade high. A higher interest rate is detrimental to growth sectors like consumer discretionary.However, as we have entered 2023, consumer discretionary has shown an initial sign of revival. Month to date, of the 11 broad sectors of the market's benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR has gained 9.3%, second only to the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR that has rallied 12.6%.At this stage, investment in consumer discretionary stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should become fruitful. Five such stocks are - Deckers Outdoor Corp., Activision Blizzard Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Ralph Lauren Corp. and NIKE Inc..     Consumer Discretionary Sector to Revive in 2023The consumer discretionary sector is set to revive its fortune this year. Here are the reasons:(1) Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October, November and December with respect to several measures have clearly indicated this. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers released on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook slipped to a preliminary reading of 4.0% this month from 4.4% in December, the lowest reading since April 2021.Story continues(2) The Fed raised  the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 to the range of 4.25-4.5%. Market is currently expecting the central  bank to increase the interest rate by maximum 75 basis points in 2023. Some financial analysts are expecting the first rate cut to come in the last quarter of 2023 or in early 2024.(3) Headwinds of the pandemic are also behind us. China is gradually reopening since the beginning of this year after strict lockdowns last year. This will help revive the completely devastated global-supply chain system. Global trade will also gain momentum.(4) The U.S. labor market remains resilient. The initial results of the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were not as disappointing as expected. Therefore, the Fed may reach its goal of a soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks with strong potential for 2023.

277,4e9db239-07db-372a-8af5-374f48d41370,ZION,2023-01-26,"Earnings Update: Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) Just Reported Its Full-Year Results And Analysts Are Updating Their Forecasts",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-zions-bancorporation-national-association-142901266.html,1674656941,STORY,"['ZION', 'ZIONP']","[Investors in Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION) had a good week, as its shares rose 7.3% to close at US$51.77 following the release of its yearly results. Results look mixed - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$3.0b, statutory earnings beat expectations 3.2%, with Zions Bancorporation National Association reporting profits of US$5.79 per share. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year. See our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Zions Bancorporation National Association from 17 analysts is for revenues of US$3.46b in 2023 which, if met, would be a solid 14% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to rise 9.7% to US$6.48. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$3.56b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.64 in 2023. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the small dip in earnings per share expectations.The analysts made no major changes to their price target of US$58.11, suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Zions Bancorporation National Association's valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Zions Bancorporation National Association analyst has a price target of US$66.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$49.00. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.Story continuesLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Zions Bancorporation National Association's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 14% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2023 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 2.7% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 6.4% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Zions Bancorporation National Association is expected to grow much faster than its industry.The Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Zions Bancorporation National Association. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple Zions Bancorporation National Association analysts - going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.However, before you get too enthused, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Zions Bancorporation National Association that you should be aware of.Have feedback on this article?

In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$1.0m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 each. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$45.34, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Kleber Santos.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.05% of Wells Fargo shares, worth about US$91m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Our analysis of Wells Fargo insider transactions leaves us cautious. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Wells Fargo. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Wells Fargo that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This is expected to be January 31, 2023. On that day, Pfizer is projected to report earnings of $1.05 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 2.78%.

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

The subvariants are descendants of Omicron, the most contagious variant of the virus causing COVID-19.The CDC said the updated vaccine worked similarly against BA.5-related infections and XBB/XBB.1.5-related infections. It was 52% effective at preventing infections against BA.5 and 48% against XBB/XBB.1.5 among those aged 18-49. Effectiveness fell to 37% against BA.5 and 43% against XBB/XBB.1.5 among those aged 65 years and older.The CDC also said that the study shows how the vaccines work on a population level, but individuals might not see the same benefit. People should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC said.XBB.1.5 was estimated to make up nearly half of U.S. cases in the week ended Jan. 21, government data showed.The CDC analysis comes ahead of a meeting on Thursday at which outside experts to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to discuss whether and how the United States should offer the COVID vaccine as an annual shot.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe in Bengaluru and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago Editing by Caroline Humer and Matthew Lewis)]"

It is in talks to sell the stake in Move for more than $3 billion, Reuters has reported.Since the move to renuite Fox and News Corp was first announced in October last year, a number of large shareholders on both sides had opposed the deal.T. Rowe Price, the biggest investor in News Corp with a roughly 12% stake, had previously expressed concerns that the deal would undervalue News Corp. On Wednesday, portfolio manager Vincent DeAugustino cheered News Corp's decision to scrap the deal.""We applaud the decision to forgo such a transaction as News Corp considers other options to unlock value,"" he said in a statement.On Tuesday, activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which had also opposed the proposed reunion of Fox and News Corp, applauded the decision to not move forward.Cowen &amp; Co's Doug Creutz said investors were pleased by the decision to walk away from a potential combination, saying that pressure from investors like T Rowe Price weighed on the Murdoch's decision to pursue the deal.A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders. Fox shares were up about 2% on Wednesday.Story continuesWhile News Corp's decision to sell Move has been positively received, questions now remain on the future of the company's non-media assets, which include its stake in Australian real estate company REA Group Ltd.""The other big question is – does News Corp give their shareholders their pro-rata shares of REA in addition to selling Move? That would clean out the real estate holdings of the company and simplify the structure of News Corp, which is greatly needed as the company is overly complicated,"" said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research.(Reporting by Milana Vinn and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Writing by Anirban Sen; Editing by Daniel Wallis)]"

288,6ff03214-905b-321f-bdf4-74eabdfafac5,PYPL,2023-01-26,America’s biggest banks are teaming up to take on Apple Pay and PayPal with a new digital wallet. Analysts think it could flop,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-biggest-banks-teaming-apple-204042611.html,1674679242,STORY,"['BAC', 'PYPL']","[Ever since PayPal, Apple Pay, and Cash App lured hundreds of millions of users to their digital wallets, big banks have grasped for ways to pull them back into services they control.The latest example is a push by seven banks, including Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, to build a wallet of their own to compete with the payment goliaths, according to The Wall Street Journal.The banks' Early Warning Services consortium, which manages the money-transfer service Zelle, announced on Tuesday that it will operate the as-of-yet unnamed wallet. The plan is to provide “debit or credit card customers with an easy and secure way to pay while shopping online,” a spokesperson for Early Warning Services said in a statement to Fortune.An explicit goal of the new wallet is to make inroads against the likes of PayPal and Apple Pay, according to the Journal. Analysts that closely track payment services companies are skeptical, however, that the forthcoming bank wallet will take a significant bite out of these companies’ market share.“TBD Whether It’s Going to Work”“It's TBD whether or not it's going to work or not,” Sanjay Sakhrani, a PayPal analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, told Fortune.Harshita Rawat, an analyst at AllianceBernstein who specializes in fintech companies, was similarly dubious. “Success is not guaranteed,” she said in an interview with Fortune. “It's very, very hard to gain traction in online payments.”And according to Trevor Williams, a fintech analyst at Jefferies, the wallet is unlikely to pose any competitive threat to PayPal or other established online payment services. “The banks are going to have a hard time getting any kind of broad consumer adoption of whatever wallet they come up with together,” he said.One major reason for the skepticism lies in a history of the big banks’ repeatedly trying, but ultimately, failing to challenge the dominance of the likes of Apple when it comes to online payments.Story continuesIn 2016, JP Morgan Chase launched its own digital wallet, “Chase Pay.” However, less than five years later it scuttled the service. And, in 2020, Visa scrapped its online checkout service. (It later teamed up with Discover, Mastercard, and American Express to collectively launch a one-click checkout button to rival PayPal.)Yet, compared to fintech analysts’ less-than-rosy assessments of the banks’ new unnamed wallet, Gerard Cassidy, a big banks analyst at RBC Capital Markets, was more optimistic.“The banks are fast followers when it comes to some of these technologies,” he told Fortune. “And because of their established position in the financial system, they seem to be able to gain momentum once they're committed to the product.”Wallet WarsThe competitive landscape of digital wallets is already vast, which is partly why fintech analysts remain unconvinced by the banks’ latest attempt to gain market share.In its last annual SEC filing, PayPal said that it had 426 million active accounts. And investment analysts estimated that there were approximately 507 million users of Apple Pay in 2020. Add in Cash App, Google Pay, and a new wallet from Robinhood, and the competition for users is already at a fevered pitch.Perhaps that’s why companies like PayPal and Robinhood have tried to attract new customers through new crypto offerings. PayPal has launched numerous initiatives to allow users to buy crypto, including its recent integration with MetaMask’s Web3 wallet. And Robinhood launched a digital wallet for cryptocurrencies last year.Early Warning Services, the company that will operate the banks’ new wallet, did not comment on whether the wallet will have any crypto functionality. And any likelihood that it will is a question for years down the line.“Crypto is kryptonite for the banks,” said Cassidy, the analyst at RBC. “And until the regulators can get their arms around it to make sure that we're not going to have some significant problems with cryptocurrencies, I would say that it's not something that is a focus.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Large cap stocks are preferred by investors because they are typically well-established companies with a strong track record of performance and stability. These stocks are considered less risky than small-cap stocks, which are issued by newer or smaller companies that may be more volatile. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer behavior shifted towards technology-based activities such as online shopping and streaming services. However, as the economy started to recover and people returned to their pre-pandemic habits, some of these tech companies may have seen a decline in business. Despite that, large-cap stocks, including tech plays, have always been an attractive option for investors, since they protect portfolios from market volatility relatively well. Gradient Investments’ Mariann Montagne joined CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ on January 19, and she explained that investors should look for companies that meet or exceed earnings expectations and grow backlogs faster than the overall market. She noted that now is the time to load up on high quality large-cap names, which are reasonably priced and offer a lot of value. Some of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 large cap stocks — companies which have market capitalizations of between $10 billion and $200 billion — that have P/E ratios of less than 10 as of January 24. That means the stocks mentioned in the article are the most popular undervalued large-cap stocks among the elite hedge funds operating in financial markets. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues15 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMost Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 8.51Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar initiated coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve its capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should draw investors' attention to its strong cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks popular among smart investors. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”14. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 4.39Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a Texas-based company that manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services in the United States. On November 28, Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) announced the expansion of its existing stock repurchase plan by $1 billion to a total of nearly $1.5 billion, inclusive of the remaining outstanding authorization at the end of the third quarter of 2022. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds.  On January 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) from $72 to $90 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. He now has more confidence in his belief that residential new construction will ""remain surprisingly resilient"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were bullish on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 5.76 million shares worth $340 million.Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”13. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.37Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas. It operates as an independent exploration and production company in the United States and internationally. The company returned $1,176 million to equity holders in the third quarter of 2022, a record for shareholder distributions, including $1,122 million of share repurchases and $54 million of base dividends. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to monitor.  On January 13, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear reiterated an Overweight rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $42. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), with 8.3 million shares worth $188 million. Overall, 50 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of September 2022. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”12. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.75Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. It operates through two segments, Refining &amp; Marketing, and Midstream. In Q3 2022, the company announced a dividend increase of approximately 30% to $0.75 per share. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to invest in according to smart investors. On January 9, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen raised the firm's price target on Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) from $126 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. She expects the company to report another quarter of strong Refining &amp; Marketing earnings due to the favorable macroeconomic conditions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was part of 50 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, and Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 11 million shares worth over $1 billion. Here is what Clark Street Value has to say about Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“During the worst of covid, I bought some LEAPs on Marathon Petroleum (MPC) as a proxy for Par Pacific (PARR) since long dated options weren’t available on the later.  Those MPC calls expire next month and I’ll take profits, with PARR I’ve reduced my position throughout the year and might sell the rest early next year, I’ve owned it for 6-7 years and it has gone nowhere, they haven’t touched the NOLs, just a difficult business that I probably don’t understand as well as I should.”11. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 24: 6.76Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily focuses on the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company reported Q3 net earnings of $1.9 billion, or $2.88/ per share, and operating cash flow rose 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to consider. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The company's recent purchases and current resources are in line with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s aim of producing up to 5% more annually. However, the rating is neutral because the market is aware of the stock's recent performance, according to the analyst. Additionally, the analyst noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) should use more of its free cash flow to buy back shares in order to improve metrics over time.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 51 hedge funds were bullish on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10.

For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”9.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”7.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Large cap stocks are preferred by investors because they are typically well-established companies with a strong track record of performance and stability. These stocks are considered less risky than small-cap stocks, which are issued by newer or smaller companies that may be more volatile. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer behavior shifted towards technology-based activities such as online shopping and streaming services. However, as the economy started to recover and people returned to their pre-pandemic habits, some of these tech companies may have seen a decline in business. Despite that, large-cap stocks, including tech plays, have always been an attractive option for investors, since they protect portfolios from market volatility relatively well. Gradient Investments’ Mariann Montagne joined CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ on January 19, and she explained that investors should look for companies that meet or exceed earnings expectations and grow backlogs faster than the overall market. She noted that now is the time to load up on high quality large-cap names, which are reasonably priced and offer a lot of value. Some of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 large cap stocks — companies which have market capitalizations of between $10 billion and $200 billion — that have P/E ratios of less than 10 as of January 24.

Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”14. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 4.39Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a Texas-based company that manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services in the United States.

(NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”13. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.37Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”12. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.75Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 24: 6.76Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily focuses on the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company reported Q3 net earnings of $1.9 billion, or $2.88/ per share, and operating cash flow rose 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to consider. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The company's recent purchases and current resources are in line with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s aim of producing up to 5% more annually. However, the rating is neutral because the market is aware of the stock's recent performance, according to the analyst.

Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.60Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products.

(NYSE:NTR) and has designated it as a Top Pick in a research note titled ""2023 Fertilizer Outlook"". The analyst believes that while fertilizer prices are expected to be lower, it will be partially offset by lower input costs for natural gas. Additionally, the analyst noted that the seasonal peak in demand during spring will provide support for pricing and act as a positive catalyst for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), compared to 48 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $701.8 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“However, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”9.

(NASDAQ:FANG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as the oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B.

Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the largest position holder in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of September 2022, with 6.5 million shares worth $263.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy  has to say about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”7.

(NYSE:VZ)’s investments in building out its 5G network will start to pay off in the future, leading to improved operational and financial performance.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.63 per share and $41.54 billion, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ fourth-quarter earnings per share has been revised downward by a penny over the past seven days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates year-over-year growth of 20.7%. The top-line estimate implies year-over-year growth of 23.7%.In the last reported quarter, GM beat earnings estimates on better-than-expected profits from North America and International segments. Over the trailing four quarters, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 13.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:General Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company QuoteFactors Shaping Q4 EarningsGeneral Motors was the top-selling carmaker in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. GM’s total fourth-quarter U.S. sales increased 41.4% year over year to 623,261 vehicles. While Buick deliveries skid 6.5% year over year, sales of the other three brands — Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac — posted double-digit year-over-year percentage gains. Sales of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac jumped 43.3%, 42.3% and 74.8%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMNA segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 798,000 units, implying an increase from 579,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2021. Thanks to higher unit sales and rising vehicle prices, the consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $34,277 million, implying a rise from $26,865 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for operating profit from the segment is pegged at $3,367 million, indicating an increase of 55.5% year over year.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMI segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 215,000 units, implying an increase from 163,000 units in the fourth quarter of 2021. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $4,479 million, indicating a rise from $3,451 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the operating profit from the segment is pegged at $288 million, indicating growth from $275 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the GM Financial unit is pegged at $3,258 million, up from $3,232 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. However. the company’s dimmed 2022 EBIT outlook from the segment raises concern. The consensus mark for GM Financial’s operating profit is $775 million, implying a fall from $1,180 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for the GM Cruise unit’s operating loss stands at $445 million, widening from $349 million incurred in the year-ago period.While higher-year-over-year shipments and revenues from GMNA and GMI segments bode well, weak forecasts from GM Financial and GM Cruise dim the overall fourth-quarter view. It is also to be noted that high commodity costs, including platinum group metals and steel prices, are likely to have played spoilsports. General Motors expects headwinds from commodity inflation and logistical challenges to be around more than $5 billion higher from 2021 levels as well as the prior projection. This further softens the outlook for the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Motors this time around.

305,f9ba869b-e1db-3fc6-9b48-ae73fc3eefd6,MKC,2023-01-26,McCORMICK REPORTS 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES 2023 OUTLOOK,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-reports-2022-financial-results-113000703.html,1674732600,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V']","[CisionHUNT VALLEY, Md., Jan. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC), a global leader in flavor, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and provided its financial outlook for fiscal year 2023.For fiscal year 2022, sales increased 1% from the prior year and, in constant currency, sales grew 3%. Earnings per share was $2.52 as compared to $2.80 in 2021. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.53 as compared to $3.05 in 2021.For the fourth quarter, sales declined 2% from the year-ago period and, in constant currency, sales increased 2%. Earnings per share was $0.69 in the fourth quarter as compared to $0.73 in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 in the year-ago period.For fiscal year 2023, McCormick expects to increase year-on-year sales by 5% to 7%. The Company expects to grow operating income by 10% to 12%. Adjusted operating income is expected to increase 9% to 11%. Chairman and CEO's Remarks Lawrence E. Kurzius, Chairman and CEO, stated, ""Our fourth quarter concluded a challenging year for McCormick as we navigated a dynamic global environment including persistently high cost inflation and supply chain challenges, significant disruptions in China related to COVID, and the conflict in Ukraine. Despite market-driven volatility, we ended the year with positive momentum in consumer consumption trends and Flavor Solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply, and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure, all of which are important drivers in our continued execution of McCormick's long-term strategies.""For the fourth quarter, our reported sales declined 2%, but in constant currency grew 2%, both of which were within the range implied by our fiscal year 2022 guidance, but below our own expectations. COVID-related disruptions in China unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both the total Company and our Consumer segment by approximately 2%. Barring the China disruption, we estimate our total Company fourth quarter sales would have been comparable to the year ago period, or grown 4% in constant currency, the mid-point of the implied range. Moreover, our reported fourth quarter sales comparison to the year-ago period included a 2% unfavorable impact attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exits of our Consumer business in Russia and a low margin business in India. Accounting for these strategic exits, our underlying sales performance is strong.Story continues""Importantly, in our Consumer segment, aside from China, we saw strength in consumption trends, particularly in the U.S. where our fourth quarter total branded consumption grew 6%, and in our Flavor Solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding with continued momentum across all regions. Consumers' rising demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers' products, is not only reflected in this performance, but also reinforced by our most recent proprietary consumer insights research. Our alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating, and valuing trusted brands combined with our broad and advantaged portfolio, plus the fundamental strength of our categories continues to underscore McCormick's positioning for long-term, differentiated growth and bolsters confidence in our 2023 sales growth outlook.""While our sales were within our implied guidance range, operating income for the fourth quarter fell short. Unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our Consumer segment, primarily due to lower U.S. spice and seasonings sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022 and lower sales in China. The sales mix between segments also contributed to unfavorable product mix. Meanwhile, in our Flavor Solutions segment, we made progress on reducing the elevated costs we are incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business; however, the impact of that progress was offset by unexpected, discrete one-time issues.""We are committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. In our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies, while also strengthening our ability to service customers. We are targeting the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs. We are also taking streamlining actions across our entire organization, targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings. The combination of these actions, which is our Global Operating Effectiveness Program, is incremental to our CCI savings. We have a proven track record of cost reduction through our CCI program, and we are leveraging the same program discipline to drive results. We expect our Global Operating Effectiveness Program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize $75 million in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. Our actions are already yielding results and we expect their impact to scale-up as the year progresses.""As we look ahead to fiscal 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure, and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals that drove our industry-leading historical financial performance remain strong and we are confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023.""I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2022 and as they drive our momentum in 2023.""Fourth Quarter 2022 ResultsMcCormick reported a 2% sales decline in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period, or 2% sales growth in constant currency. Constant currency sales growth reflected a 9% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 3% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, lower China consumption due to COVID-related restrictions and the exits of a low margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia, as well as a 4% decline in all other volume and product mix.Sales grew at a constant currency three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% for the total Company off of a pre-pandemic baseline of 2019. The three-year constant currency CAGR's for the Consumer segment and the Flavor Solutions segment were 3% and 9%, respectively.Gross profit margin declined 380 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year and adjusted gross profit margin, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses, declined 410 basis points. This decline was driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, as well as unfavorable product mix, partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings led by the Company's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined from the year-ago period driven by lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments. Operating income was $264 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $276 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This decline was driven by gross margin compression, primarily in the Company's Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, special charges, and transaction and integration expenses. Excluding special charges, as well as transaction and integration expenses, adjusted operating income was $278 million compared to $309 million in the year-ago period.Earnings per share was $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.11 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $0.84 in the year-ago period. This decrease was driven by lower adjusted operating income.Fiscal Year 2022 ResultsMcCormick reported a 1% sales increase in 2022 as compared to 2021, or 3% in constant currency. Sales growth reflected an 8% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 5% decrease in volume and product mix. The volume decline included a 1% unfavorable impact from lower China consumption due to COVID-related restrictions and the exits of a low margin business in India and the Consumer business in Russia. The impact of lower sales from the Kitchen Basics divestiture was offset by one month of incremental sales from the FONA acquisition.Sales grew at a constant currency three-year CAGR of 6% for the total Company off of a pre-pandemic baseline of 2019. The three-year constant currency CAGR's for the Consumer segment and the Flavor Solutions segment were 5% and 8%, respectively, showing sustained momentum in the business in both segments.Gross profit margin declined 370 basis points versus 2021 and adjusted gross profit margin, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses, declined 390 basis points. This decline was driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, as well as unfavorable product mix, partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings led by the Company's CCI program. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined from the year-ago period driven by lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments. Operating income was $864 million in 2022 compared to $1.02 billion in 2021. This decline was driven by gross margin compression, primarily in the Company's Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses and lower transaction and integration expenses. Excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as special charges, adjusted operating income was $917 million compared to $1.10 billion in the year-ago period.Earnings per share was $2.52 in 2022 compared to $2.80 in the prior year. The net unfavorable impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, and the gain on the sale of the Kitchen Basics business lowered earnings per share by $0.01 in 2022. The net impact of special charges, transaction, and integration expenses, including an unfavorable income tax expense impact from a discrete item related to the acquisition of FONA, and the gain on the sale of the Company's minority stake in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd lowered earnings per share by $0.25 in 2021. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $2.53 in 2022 compared to $3.05 in 2021. This decrease was driven by lower adjusted operating income.Net cash provided by operating activities was $652 million in 2022 compared to $828 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income and higher inventory levels.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial OutlookMcCormick's broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio enables the Company to meet the rising demand for flavor around the world. The Company is capitalizing on the growing consumer interests in healthy and flavorful cooking, digital engagement, valuing trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. This, coupled with the breadth and reach of McCormick's portfolio and its proven strategies, position the Company to sustainably continue its growth trajectory.McCormick expects strong underlying business performance in 2023 driven by sales growth. The Company also expects a favorable impact to operating income from its Global Operating Effectiveness Program and the lapping of the negative impact of the COVID-related disruptions in China in 2022, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and an expected increase in employee incentive compensation expenses given the expected improvement in underlying business performance. In addition, the Company expects earnings per share growth will be tempered by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate compared to 2022. Excluding this interest and tax headwind, McCormick's operating performance growth is expected to be strong. The Company expects minimal impact on net sales, operating income, and earnings per share from currency rates in 2023.In 2023, the McCormick expects to grow sales by 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The Company expects sales growth to be driven by primarily pricing actions, which in conjunction with cost savings, are expected to offset inflationary pressures. McCormick also expects to drive continued growth through the strength of its brands, as well as brand marketing, new products, category management, and differentiated customer engagement plans. Operating income in 2023 is expected to grow by 10% to 12% from $864 million in 2022. The Company anticipates approximately $50 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previous organizational and streamlining actions. Excluding the impact of special charges and integration expenses in 2023 and 2022, adjusted operating income is expected to increase 9% to 11%.McCormick projects 2023 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.47, compared to $2.52 of earnings per share in 2022. The Company expects special charges to lower earnings per share by $0.14 in 2023. Excluding these impacts, the Company projects 2023 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.61, compared to $2.53 of adjusted earnings per share in 2022, which represents an expected increase of 1% to 3%. This reflects strong operating performance, partially offset by an 8% headwind from higher interest expense due to the higher interest-rate environment and lapping the impact of an optimization of the Company's debt portfolio last year, as well as a 1% headwind from an anticipated increase in the Company's projected adjusted effective tax rate. For fiscal 2023, the Company expects strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and anticipates returning a significant portion of cash flow to shareholders through dividends.Business Segment Results Consumer Segment(in millions)Three months endedYear ended11/30/202211/30/202111/30/202211/30/2021Net sales$ 1,037.8$ 1,123.6$ 3,757.9$ 3,937.5Operating income, excluding special  charges, transaction and integration  expenses235.2250.4710.7804.9Consumer segment sales declined 8% from the fourth quarter of 2021.

These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:Special charges – In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned ""Special charges"" in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses and income associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (generally including details with respect to estimated costs, which typically consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component, such as an asset impairment, or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee's advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Special charges for the year ended November 30, 2022 include a $13.6 million gain associated with the sale of the Kohinoor brand name. We exited our Kohinoor rice product line in India in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.Transaction and integration expenses associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA in November and December 2020, respectively, and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as ""Transaction and integration expenses,"" include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventories, together with the impact of discrete tax items, if any, directly related to each acquisition.Income from sale of unconsolidated operations – We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation in March 2021. The sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd resulted in a gain of $13.4 million, net of tax of $5.7 million. The gain is included in Income from unconsolidated operations in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2021.Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics - We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of our Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. The pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million for the year ended November 30, 2022.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed ""on a constant currency basis,"" is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income as well as compounded annual growth rates expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

The inaugural graduating class includes 51 students – with nearly 80% being women or people of color – marking the next step towards the airline's goal to train about 5,000 new pilots at the school by 2030, with the added goal of at least half women or people of color.The recruitment and hiring of pilots is a priority at United and the academy is an example of the long-term investments in infrastructure, training, and aircraft the airline has made in the past few years. Just last month, United purchased more widebodies than any U.S. airline in history and announced it's now the largest carrier across both the Pacific and Atlantic. To support that growth, United hired about 2,400 pilots in 2022 and plans to hire another 2,500 this year. United intends to add at least 10,000 pilots by the end of this decade.United CEO Scott Kirby and United COO Toby Enqvist will honor the first class of graduates at a ceremony later this morning at the Phoenix Goodyear Airport.""United is leading the industry in the training, recruitment and hiring of the next generation of talented commercial pilots and the progress we've made at United Aviate Academy after just one year is another example of an airline where good leads the way,"" said Kirby. ""I'm so proud of this first class of graduates – they've taken an important first step in their career and they reflect our commitment to hiring people who exceed the highest professional and safety standards. I look forward to eventually welcoming them to our United team and I can't wait to see them flying our new United Next planes in the years to come.""Story continuesUnited Aviate Academy graduates can continue to build flight time and leadership experience while continuing within the United Aviate pilot career development program's ecosystem. Some graduates will work as Certified Flight Instructors at the academy to continue accruing the 1,500 required flying hours – a common industry practice for aspiring pilots – while others will build experience at participating flight schools or universities, including Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Purdue University and Hampton University. The United Aviate program then encourages graduates to eventually fly for a United Express carrier, take on leadership roles at an Aviate participating Part 135 operator, or become a Fleet Technical Instructor at United to complete their training. Aviate participants can expect to become a United pilot within about six years of graduating from United Aviate Academy.Captaining Your Career at UnitedUnited currently has more than 14,000 pilots, and Captains of United's Boeing 787s and 777s can earn more than $350,000 per year plus a rich package of benefits. In addition, United pilots receive one of the highest 401(k) matches in the nation – 16% of base pay.While the airline continues to see strong interest in pilot roles from military and civilian backgrounds as well as from other carriers, for many people becoming a pilot seems not only out of reach financially, but completely unimaginable.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 5.6% of pilots are women and 6% are people of color. And training to achieve a commercial pilot's license in the U.S. can cost at least $100,000, with supplementary costs adding to the financial burden.To help address financial barriers to entry, United and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. established a scholarship fund in 2020 and are working with leading industry partners to award more than $5 million in scholarships for prospective academy students. In addition, Boeing has committed funding to expand the program this year. United also directly works with the following organizations to educate prospects about the benefits of becoming a pilot and to find candidates for scholarship opportunities:Organization of Black Aerospace ProfessionalsSisters of the SkiesWomen in Aviation InternationalNational Gay Pilots AssociationThe Latino Pilots AssociationThe Professional Asian Pilots AssociationExperimental Aircraft Association (EAA)As a result of these efforts, United Aviate Academy has received more than 22,000 applications, with nearly 70% of applicants being women or people of color.United Aviate AcademyUnited Aviate Academy currently has more than 240 students, with nearly 75% women or people of color. In the flight school's first year of operations, collectively, the students have flown more than 2 million miles, achieved more than 250 aviation certificates, and completed more than 68,000 takeoffs and landings. The aspiring pilots also organized 174 ""Pool Dunks"" in the campus swimming pool, a new tradition that commemorates each time a student completes a solo flight for the first time.The 340,000 square-foot facility at Phoenix Goodyear Airport includes world-class features such as:Forty late-model Cirrus SR-20 series single-engine aircraft, which feature advanced safety characteristicsSeven FRASCA flight simulatorsNearly 50,000 square feet of office spaceMultiple aircraft hangarsDormitory rooms for student housing with ample room for expansionProximity to many auxiliary airfields in the Phoenix areaFavorable weather for year-round flight trainingFor more information on United Aviate Academy, please visit unitedaviate.com/academy or @unitedaviateacademy on Instagram.United NextGraduates of United Aviate Academy have a lot to look forward to.

Combined with already announced orders, the airline expects to take delivery of about 700 new aircraft by 2032, including an average of more than two every week in 2023 and three a week in 2024.This historic purchase is the next chapter in the carrier's ambitious United Next plan and builds on United's strengths: the leading U.S. international gateways, a robust domestic network supporting the global fleet, a premium onboard experience and the most widebody aircraft among North American carriers.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

The program offers high school seniors the opportunity to build their resumes, sharpen their interview skills and develop other skills in preparation for interviews with potential employers. Since its February 2018 launch, the program has created a talent pipeline of early career professionals ready to enter the workforce after high school graduation in entry-level roles.""PartnerUp empowers high school graduates to enter and thrive in a job market that's in need of their skills,"" says Brianna McMeekin, talent program manager at PNC. ""Employers partner with teachers and parents to provide committed guidance, real-world opportunities and ongoing assistance. Graduates then take the first step on a path that leads to a fulfilling and secure future - for themselves and the community they call home.""The Program and Its ImpactThe program has been rolled out in 50 high schools and to more than 6,000 students to date, offering an in-school curriculum for 11th- and 12th-graders. The focus for 11th graders centers on teaching students about career decision-making, financial literacy and professionalism, among other topics.In 12th grade, the students focus on resumes, interview preparation and identifying skills they can use to market themselves. This program level is only for students who have determined they want to start their career right out of high school, rather than going on to post-secondary education.Story continuesThroughout the program's five-year existence, 16 partner employers have participated and offered students the chance to land positions in a variety of industries. PNC has offered roles at the company to over 70 graduates of the program. Niko Haughey, senior detection and investigation analyst at PNC, was among those 70 PartnerUp graduates to receive an offer from the bank.""PNC offered me a way to get my foot in the door and demonstrate what I was capable of doing,"" says Haughey, who joined PNC in 2019 as a bank teller. ""The combination of coursework that is focused on the hard and soft skills you need to be successful, and the mentoring and job shadowing opportunities we were given, all really prepared me to step into my first role.""Expanding the EffortIn 2022, the need to fill the skills gap remains prevalent. Three in four global employers saw a talent shortage of about 75%2.In an effort to meet talent development needs beyond Pittsburgh, PNC expanded PartnerUp into its Cleveland market and has plans to offer the program in the Birmingham, Alabama, market during the 23-24 school year. The PartnerUp team also is building resources and support for PNC markets interested in bringing components of the program to their regions.Vicki Henn, chief human resources officer at PNC, says the vision for the program always has been to develop a scalable model that could be deployed in other regions.""With PartnerUp's expansion, we're working with more employers and local education partners to provide local high school graduates with the skills needed to land entry-level careers in high-demand industries such as healthcare and financial services, without the burden of student loan debt,"" Henn says.Investing in the Talent Pool and CommunityPartnerUp represents a shift in how PNC and other employers view the labor market, investing in talent in new ways instead of just consuming it, Henn says.""As a talent-focused company, we're committed to investing in impactful skills development programs and educational initiatives that help drive career growth and economic opportunity in the communities we serve,"" she adds.McMeekin sees PartnerUp as more than a way to leverage early career talent, stating that the program is also about adding to the communities PNC serves.""Ultimately, our goal is to invest in communities,"" McMeekin says. ""We want to ensure our high school graduates have a clear understanding of all the opportunities available to them post-graduation and are ready to productively apply their talents to make a difference in their community, the local economy and their futures.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736706/PNC-Taps-High-Schools-as-Means-of-Solving-Entry-Level-Skills-Gap]"

(NYSE: PNC) announced today the closing of its latest Green Bond issuance. The proceeds will fund eligible projects that promote a transition to a low-carbon economy and offer sustainability benefits across four categories aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including renewable energy, energy efficiency green buildings, and clean transportation. PNC issued its inaugural green bond in 2019 and its first social bond in 2021.""We are committed to supporting the transition to a low carbon economy while balancing financial priorities and environmental considerations,"" said Michael P. Lyons, executive vice president and head of PNC's Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking. ""This green bond issuance builds on existing initiatives already underway, including our recently enhanced $30 billion environmental finance commitment, which we increased by 50% in response to escalating client demand. We're looking forward to building on this momentum and supporting our clients as they consider financing options for their sustainability goals.""The transaction was very well received by investors, with demand well in excess of the $1.25 billion in issued notes.

PNC Capital Markets, LLC was the lead green structuring agent on the deal which also included two veteran, minority or women-owned broker dealers as co-managers – Academy Securities, Inc. and Siebert Williams Shank &amp; Co., LLC.""We were very pleased with the reception of our latest green bond offering. Our significantly oversubscribed issuance demonstrated investor enthusiasm for this asset class and a desire to support the financing of green projects that promote a transition to a lower carbon economy, while also affirming investor confidence in PNC and its credit quality,"" said PNC Corporate Treasurer David Kahn.Story continuesProviding financing and underwriting debt with a sustainability focus is only one way PNC demonstrates its commitment to environmental stewardship. In addition, the company maintains risk management controls which incorporate climate change considerations, manages capital for its clients in ways that support their financial, environmental and social goals and actively manages its own internal operations.Along with its increased environmental finance commitment, PNC also recently announced that it is planning to establish new, ambitious, science-aligned environmental targets for its operational footprint, including further reducing carbon emissions, and energy and water consumption. These new targets will use a base year of 2022 – the first full year of combined PNC and BBVA USA operations – and will be announced as part of PNC's Corporate Responsibility Report to be published this year.More information about PNC's Sustainable Financing Bonds can be found here.This offering has been completed and was made only by means of a prospectus supplement and an accompanying prospectus filed as part of an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-3.Copies of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to this offering may be obtained for informational purposes by calling PNC Capital Markets LLC at 1-855-881-0697.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the United States, organized around its customers and communities for strong relationships and local delivery of retail and business banking including a full range of lending products; specialized services for corporations and government entities, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset-based lending; wealth management and asset management.

317,609ba93b-ad63-330b-962d-cd62e94b8e5c,TGT,2023-01-26,Positive week for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) institutional investors who lost 21% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/positive-week-target-corporation-nyse-110050394.html,1674730850,STORY,['TGT'],"[A look at the shareholders of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would appreciate the 3.2% increase in share prices last week, given their one-year returns have been disappointing at 21%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Target. Check out our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Target already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Target's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Target. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 7.4% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of TargetWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Target Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$165m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Target has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The fundamentals of our business were healthy in Q4 and for the full year 2022. Procedure growth for the full year approached pre-pandemic levels. Installed base growth was solid, and customers concurrently increase utilization of existing systems. Our investments in product development extended our multi-port, single-port and flexible robotics ecosystems through new instruments, accessories, digital products and indication expansions. Finally, the fine work of our operations teams and supply partners largely mitigated the supply chain challenges that persisted through the year. Turning first to procedures. We saw 18% procedure growth for the quarter and the full year. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, particularly benign procedures such as bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy and hernia repair.Colon and rectal procedure growth also continued. Strong growth beyond urology outside the US was accretive to our global performance. We attribute this diversification to the value of our ecosystems and our strategic investments in organization, clinical trials, data products and market access. Regionally, the United States, Japan, Europe and India stood out in the quarter and year. Procedure growth in China was hampered by the COVID wave in Q4, with procedures progressively declining starting in November through the end of 2022. Ion procedures showed continued strength, with 218% growth in 2022 compared with 2021, and SP procedures grew 38% over the same period, with the majority of its growth coming from Korea. Global core procedure areas of urology and gynecology moved toward recovery in the year, both exceeding their three-year compound annual growth rates in 2022.On the capital front, we placed 369 systems in Q4 compared with 385 in Q4 2021. For the full year, we placed 1,264 systems compared with 1,347 in 2021. Our installed base growth rate was 12% for multiport, 149% for Ion and 22% for SP in 2022. Overall, our capital placement trends showed sustained demand for additional capacity in multiport and strong interest in expanding capacity for Ion with several hospitals now operating multiple Ion systems in their programs and variable demand for SP as we continue to pursue our additional indications. System utilization is an important predictor of future demand and utilization grew 5% for multiport in the year and 10% for Ion. Utilization was roughly flat for SP over the year, however, utilization increased by 9% in Q4 measured year-over-year as our organization incorporated learnings.Touching on our finances, revenue grew 9% in 2022. Revenue was impacted by the strength of the dollar in the year and the decline of the trade-in population of third-generation multiport systems. Our expenses landed at the higher end of our spend guidance reflecting continued R&amp;D investments that support the growth of our platforms and digital products, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial capabilities, and capital amortization driven by expansion of our global footprint. Structurally, we have been increasing our own capital expenditures as we continue to build the company to supply the globe at industrial scale. This is an important investment as several procedures using our systems have become the standard of care in several countries.We have been vertically integrating key technologies to develop a more robust supply chain and bring important products to market at attractive price points. These investments include increased ownership of our imaging pipelines, strategic instrument and accessory technologies, and software and digital products that allow us to serve our customers. The investments make our business more capital-intensive than years past, in support of industrial dependability, a more robust supply chain, and lower product costs. I'd also like to take a moment to walk through our platform investments. Intuitive starts with the end in mind. Coordinating our efforts to enable our customers' pursuit of the quadruple aim in specific procedures, for example, those in general surgery.We design all our systems to allow for the addition of new functionality over time. For our multiport platform, this design philosophy has enabled us to continuously strengthen our fourth generation da Vinci Xi by adding new regulatory clearances, a new model with the da Vinci X, new instruments and accessories, new imaging capabilities, and new software products. These products include our stapling lot of instruments as well as our advanced energy instruments, which contributed approximately $890 million in revenue in 2022 with revenue growth of 18% in the year and are a key enabler of the general surgery growth discussed a minute ago. We added 65 representative clinical procedure indications in the United States to our fourth-generation multiport platform since its launch.Our multiport indications now spans six surgical categories and total over 70 procedure indications for multiport platforms in the United States today. We routinely improve our platform operating systems with roughly 10 significant fourth-generation OS releases since launch and dozens of smaller software upgrades. We launched our next-generation Xi visualization, Endoscope Plus, and have been integrating digital products, including virtual reality training Intuitive Hub and the My Intuitive app. We expect to launch additional Gen 4 compatible products and operating system software this year. Concurrently, we invest in new generations of our multiport platform that bring new and significantly enhanced capabilities. For our multi-port system development programs, we prioritize as follows.Our highest priority is the improvement of core surgical capability targeting improved patient outcomes, often through innovation in robot and instrument precision, imaging and sensing while focusing on dependability and product quality. Next, we designed to improve usability, care team's skill acquisition and analytic power, including digital products for the operating room, personalized learning for care teams and efficiency analysis and services for surgical programs. Next, we design platforms and their ecosystems that can lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And finally, we designed with the flexibility to add future capability to systems post launch. Given the time required to design and validate new architectures at any given moment, we're typically developing more than one system architecture beyond that in the market.In the current global regulatory environment, core technology changes often require human clinical trials and substantial review. These are multiyear investment cycles, and we're making good progress. As we start this year, we do not currently expect a new multi-port system launch in 2023. Turning to Ion. Adoption has been healthy based on its ability to meet an unmet clinical need in lung biopsy. We're focused on improving the manufacturability, cost and robustness of iron products to support its rapid growth in the US. We have also submitted a regulatory dossier for a review in Europe, Korea and in China's green channel. We expect clearance in Europe in 2023. We don't have a firm forecast on the time for Ion clearance in China at this time given pandemic related adjustments ongoing in the Chinese health care system.Ion is also a platform with strong opportunities for future clinical applications. We're conducting advanced development and clinical research to extend Ion into other indications in the lung. While our Ion flexible robotics offers an opportunity to provide value in the body outside the lung, our focus is on completing what we started for pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. Our single-port platform, da Vinci SP, has supported strong adoption in Korea and has recently obtained PMDA clearance with broad indications in Japan. We expect first installs of SP in Japan in the coming months. Next, we plan to submit our dossier on da Vinci SP to our notified body in Europe midyear 2023. So far, customer feedback on the clinical utility for SP has been healthy with strong multi-specialty use of SP in Korea.In the United States, some indications have required prospective clinical trials, and we're currently conducting IDE trials in colorectal surgery and thoracic surgery. We're pursuing additional indications for SP beyond these two, and we'll share more information on these indications in 2023 as the requirements for our regulatory pathway for them are established. We're continuing to invest significant resources in R&amp;D, where the portfolio we have under development positioned to support leadership in existing categories and expansion into new ones. Our capital investments will increase to support supply chain robustness, product cost reduction and global industrial scale. On the SG&amp;A front, we are making some foundational investments, and we'll turn to pursue leverage in enabling functions.Recognizing economic conditions for 2023 are hard to forecast, we're targeting a deceleration of fixed cost growth rate in 2023 relative to 2022. We expect pro forma operating margins to fluctuate in the next several quarters and then improve over the mid-term. In closing, our priorities for 2023 are as follows; first, increased adoption and focused procedures defined by country through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution; second, pursuit of expanded indications and launches for our new platforms; third, excellent performance in the continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses; and finally, pursuit of increased productivity and our functions that benefit from scale.I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.Jamie Samath: Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2022 revenue and procedures are in line with our preliminary press release of January 11. I will briefly review full year 2022 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2022 procedures grew by 18% as compared to 2021, or 15% on a three-year compound annual growth rate basis. During the year, we placed 1,264 systems at customers, down 6% year-over-year, driven by a decline in trading volumes of 165 systems due to the declining population of SIs in the field.Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 79% of total revenue and grew 15% over the prior year. Total revenue of $6.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year and grew approximately 12% on a constant currency basis. Pro forma operating margin was 35% of revenue and reflected the impact of several headwinds, FX, supply chain challenges and inflation together adversely impacted 2022 pro forma operating margin by approximately 1 percentage point. During the year, we repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or approximately 11.2 million shares, and we have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.5 billion. Turning to Q4. With respect to capital performance, we placed 369 systems, 4% lower than the 385 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year.There were 110 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 117 last year. 51 of the 110 trading transactions were with OUS customers, higher than recent trends primarily driven by customers in Japan and Brazil. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 620 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 134 are in the US. Given the continuing decline of older generation systems in the field, we expect trading volumes to decline significantly in 2023. Q4 revenue was $1.66 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 10%. For full year 2022, revenue denominated in non-USD currencies represented 24% of total revenue. The US dollar has weakened recently, and as a result, on a revenue-weighted basis, using current rates, the US dollar is approximately 100 basis points stronger than the average rates realized in 2022.Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashAdditional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: in the US we placed 181 systems in the fourth quarter, lower than the 235 systems we placed last year, reflecting cautious capital spending by customers, given the macroeconomic environment and a decline of 21 systems associated with trade-in transactions. Average system utilization in the US increased by 6%, reaching an all-time high. Outside the US we placed 188 systems in Q4 compared with 150 systems last year. Current quarter system placements included 70 into Europe, 51 into Japan, and 14 into China compared with 63 into Europe, 37 into Japan, and 14 into China in the fourth quarter of 2021. As of the end of 2022, there were 34 systems remaining under the current quota in China. There are now four local competitors that are registered in China and they're active in tenders under the existing quota.Delays in the granting of a new quota in China will constrain our ability to further grow the installed base and limit capacity for procedure growth. Leasing represented 42% of Q4 placements compared with 37% last quarter and last year. The higher lease mix was primarily driven by the mix of customers in the US who prefer to lease and reflected in part an increase in placements acquired under usage-based arrangements. While leasing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.43 million as compared to $1.45 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by FX, partially offset by a favorable regional mix and a higher mix of Xi jewel placements.We recognized $17 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $26 million in Q4 of 2021. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,820 compared with approximately $1,800 last quarter and $1,940 last year. On a year-over-year basis, FX negatively impacted I&amp;A per procedure by approximately $50 and customer ordering patterns had a negative impact of approximately $40 per procedure as customers, particularly in the US and China, reduced their inventory levels. Turning to our Ion platform. In 2022, we tripled procedures to just over 23,000 and double system placements to 192 as compared to 2021. In Q4, we placed 67 Ion systems as compared to 31 in Q4 of 2021.The installed base of Ion systems is now 321 systems, of which 132 are under operating lease arrangements. Fourth quarter Ion procedures of approximately 7,900 increased 169% as compared to last year. Leveraging previous investments we have made in our da Vinci ecosystem, during the quarter, we commenced the launch of My Intuitive app for Ion users, providing them real-time access and insights to their Ion usage statistics. Moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L, pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 68.2% compared with 70.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 69.8% last quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gross margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 50 basis points relating to the favorable conclusion of certain indirect tax matters.Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to increased fixed costs relative to revenue, the stronger US dollar and higher component pricing. The supply chain environment was challenging in Q4 and indicators of supply and inventory health did not improve as compared to last quarter. Higher fixed costs relative to revenue reflect a combination of manufacturing related inefficiencies given the environment and investments for future growth. Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with last year, driven by increased headcount, higher travel costs, increased customer training activities and higher R&amp;D related project costs. Fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses included a $30 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation, which can support their efforts for the next couple of years and did not repeat in 2022.The pace at which we are increasing headcount continued to moderate in Q4 with net additions of about 330 employees in the quarter compared to a net increase of approximately 530 employees last quarter. More than half of the employees we added in Q4 were production staff in our instrument factory in Mexico to support procedure growth. While we are slowing our hiring pace and pursuing leverage in our enabling functions, we are planning for balanced growth in operating expenses in 2023 given the opportunity to advance our next-generation robotics capabilities and the relatively earlier stage of our investments in Ion, SP and digital. In 2023, we expect a significant increase in expenses related to clinical trials. Brian will provide our outlook for operating expenses later in this call.As we look forward to our growth plans over the next several years, we are planning to make significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2022 were $532 million, and we expect 2023 capital expenditures in a range of $800 million to $1 billion, of which approximately two-thirds will be for facilities to expand our manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing investment plans include advanced proprietary facilities for production of new products and the Ion platform in California and da Vinci systems in Georgia. Internationally, we are increasing our product development capacity in Germany, building a new low-cost endoscope manufacturing facility in Bulgaria and establishing manufacturing capacity for domestic Xi production in China.We will also be expanding the footprint of our high-volume, low-cost instrument site in Mexico to support procedure growth across all of our platforms. These investments allow us to consolidate our manufacturing into larger centralized hubs, such as our headquarter campus in Sunnyvale, California and our East Coast hub just outside of Atlanta, while we will co-locate surgeon training, technology development and manufacturing capacity. These are multiyear investments. And as a result, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2023 and increase more significantly in 2024. Pro forma other income was $21.8 million for Q4, higher than $7.2 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses from remeasurement of the balance sheet and higher interest income.Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2%, lower than prior quarters, primarily as a result of a more favorable geographical earnings mix and a discrete tax benefit of $7 million associated with the foreign tax matter. Fourth quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $439 million, or $1.23 per share compared with $473 million or $1.29 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with GAAP net income of $381 million or $1.04 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, litigation charges and gains and losses on strategic investments.We ended the year with cash and investments of $6.7 billion compared with $7.4 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected share repurchases of $1 billion and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash from operating activities. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our outlook for 2023.Brian King: Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter.On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter.Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures. In China, midway through the fourth quarter, we observed the decline in procedures. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw a significant decline in procedure volume as hospitals were dealing with increase in COVID cases once the Zero-COVID policy was removed. As a result, China procedures experienced a modest year-over-year decline in Q4. Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years.While still in the early stages of adoption in the US, robotic-assisted bariatric surgery has been one of the fastest-growing procedures in general surgery for Intuitive. In October 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders released major updates to the 1991 National Institute of Health guidelines that recommended lowering the BMI for metabolic and bariatric surgery, or MBS, from 40 to 35, regardless of the presence, absence or severity of comorbidities. These guidelines note that, 'MBS is now preferably performed using minimally invasive surgical approaches, laparoscopical robotic'. And that 'MBS is the most effective evidence-based treatment for obesity across all BMI classes.' In another bariatric analysis, Dr. Wayne Barley from St. Luke's University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, recently published a descriptive analysis from the NBA SIP database identifying the proportion of MBS procedures in the US performed between 2015 and 2020.Using a robotic or laparoscopic approach and found up to a threefold difference in the proportion of various robotic-assisted MBS cases per year. We believe our investments in advanced instruments and surgeon training are helping to drive adoption of robotic-assisted surgery in bariatrics. We look forward to continuing to support surgeons and their care teams as they provide high-quality robotic minimally invasive care for an even greater portion of the population under the new guidelines. A recent rectal cancer study by Dr. Fang from Fudan University in Shanghai and on behalf of the RealStudy Group, published short-term outcomes from a multicenter randomized controlled trial in the Lancet. This study impaired robotic-assisted and laparoscopic approaches performed by experienced surgeons for middle and low rectal cancer across 11 hospitals in China, with approximately 580 cases included in each approach.With respect to very operative outcomes, the rate of patients with a positive circumferential margin was 3.2% lower in the robotic-assisted group as well as a 3.6% higher rate of complete macroscopic resection. Furthermore, patient laparoscopic arm experienced a 2.2% higher rate of conversion to open. A 3.3% higher rate of intraoperative complications was also reported in the laparoscopic group. Notably, 5.8% less abdominal perineal resections were performed in the robotic group. Postoperatively, patients in the robotic-assisted arm also had a faster gastrointestinal recovery postoperatively as well as a one-day shorter length of stay an approximately 7% lower rate of postoperative complications with the Clavien-Dindo of 2 or higher. In summary, the authors concluded that short-term outcomes suggests that for middle and low rectal cancer, Robotic surgery by experienced surgeons resulted in better quality resection than conventional laparoscopic surgery with less surgical trauma and better postoperative recovery.I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023. Starting with procedures. For 2023, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 12% to 16%. The low end of the range assumes continued choppiness with COVID hospitalizations and staffing pressure at hospitals globally throughout the year. In addition, it assumes ongoing staffing, significant challenges with COVID in China and uncertainty with the timing of the new capital quota. At the high end of the range, we assume no new significant impact from COVID throughout 2023, and assume continued growth in general surgery in the US and diversified growth beyond urology outside of the US. The range does not reflect significant material, supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints similar to what we experienced at the start of the pandemic.Beyond the uncertainty with COVID in China, we expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2023 as we have experienced before the pandemic, with the first quarter being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset. With respect to revenue, as we have mentioned previously, capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand, catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity. Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors, including national health care policies, hospital capital spending cycles, reimbursement and government quotas, product cycles, economic cycles and competitive factors. Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2022 pro forma gross profit margin was 69.2%.In 2023, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2023 reflects the impact of higher infrastructure investment costs, higher supply chain costs, and a greater mix of new products, in particular, from our Ion platform. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trade-in mix, procedure mix and volumes, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the potential impact of competitive pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2022, our pro forma operating expenses grew 23%. In 2023, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 9% and 13%. The operating expense growth reflects investments to advance our platform capabilities, digital products, along with continued expansion into markets outside of the US and spending to support regulatory clearances and clinical trials.We expect our non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $610 million to $640 million in 2023. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $140 million and $160 million in 2023. With regard to income tax, in 2022, our pro forma income tax rate was 21.8%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.See also 12 Hot Penny Stocks On the Move and 11 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The bottom line declined 4.7% year over year. However, the adjusted EPS beat our estimate for EPS by 3.4%.GAAP EPS in the quarter was 91 cents compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.04 per share.Revenue DetailsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported revenues of $1.66 billion, which climbed 7.1% from the prior-year quarter. Growth in da Vinci procedure volume contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by lower system placements and foreign currency impacts. The top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It missed our estimate for total revenues by 0.32%.Segment DetailsInstruments &amp; AccessoriesRevenues at the segment totaled $940.7 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 11.6%. This can be attributed to da Vinci procedure’s 18% volume growth. This was partially offset by foreign currency impacts. The procedure volume growth in the United States reflects a favorable comparison with the year-ago quarter, given the impact of the Delta variant last year. Procedure volume in China had shown a recovery during the third quarter, which likely had raised investors’ sentiments of continued recovery in the country. However, procedure volume was adversely impacted in China during the fourth quarter, following a resurgence in COVID-19. The company believes that the adverse impact of COVID-19 may continue in China. The negative impact on procedure volume in China is also likely to have contributed to the fall in the price of ISRG stock during after-hours trading on Jan 24.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The company displayed strong segmental performance in the quarter under review. It witnessed growth in da Vinci procedure volume in the fourth quarter. However, resurgence of COVID-19 raises uncertainty.The contraction in both gross and operating margins reflects rising costs and expenses amid inflationary pressure. However, the margins are likely to improve moving forward in 2023 as operating expenses are anticipated to decline.Lower-than-expected earnings coupled with adverse impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volume in China seem to have dismayed investors. Shares of Intuitive Surgical declined 9.1% during after-hours trading on Jan 24 following dismal fourth-quarter earnings.

However, a decrease in expenses was a tailwind.Navient’s GAAP net income was $105 million against the net loss of $11 million in the prior-year quarter.For 2022, core earnings per share were $3.19, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago core earnings of $3.21 and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.39.

328,aeded7f6-07a5-3738-8952-0545c4f439b4,WRK,2023-01-26,Analysts Estimate WestRock (WRK) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-westrock-wrk-report-150003544.html,1674658803,STORY,"['WRK', 'IP']","[WestRock (WRK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.7%.Revenues are expected to be $5.09 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for WestRock?For WestRock, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WestRock will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that WestRock would post earnings of $1.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.43, delivering a surprise of +2.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.WestRock doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Paper and Related Products industry, International Paper (IP) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -11.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.18 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for International Paper has been revised 7.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.83%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Paper will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thursday's release of preliminary data on gross domestic product for the fourth quarter is expected to show an increase from the third quarter, though a narrower one.The Fed is meeting next week for its first policy decision of 2023, and analysts expect it will raise rates again, but at a lower increment. The consensus is that rates will go up a quarter of a percentage point, which is a lower amount than at its previous meetings. Fed officials have talked about wanting to get the terminal rate, now around 4.25% to 4.50% up above 5%, which means there would probably be at least one more rate hike after next week if the Fed sticks to expectations.In the meanwhile, corporate earnings continue, with some corporate executives sounding cautious for now. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example, said the fourth quarter slowdown in growth within its cloud services business would likely continue into the current quarter as customers rein in their spending to brace for tougher economic times ahead.Next week brings another key economic data point, though it will be after the Fed announces its decision on Wednesday. That would be the jobs report for January, which will be released Friday Feb. 3.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Economic outputThe preliminary reading of fourth quarter gross domestic product is due out at 8:30 ET (13:30 GMT). Analysts are expecting it to say the economy grew 2.6% from the third quarter, but that would be less than the 3.2% growth for the third quarter.2. Jobless claimsAs the Fed decides what to do with interest rates, a tight labor market still factors into its process. Initial jobless claims for last week will be released at 8:30 ET. Analysts expect 205,000, which would be more than the previous week.Story continues3. Card earningsCredit card giants Visa Inc Class A (NYSE:V) and Mastercard are both slated to report earnings, and analysts will be listening to what they say about credit quality and consumer spending. Visa is seen reporting earnings per share of $2.01 on revenue of $7.7 billion. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is seen reporting a profit of $2.58 a share on revenue of $5.8B.Related ArticlesEconomic output, jobless claims, card earnings: 3 things to watchShareholders can sue McDonald's ex-executive in landmark rulingExplainer-Who is behind Hindenburg, the company that is shorting Adani?]"

However, escalating expenses stemming from technology and platform investments are likely to have acted as a drag on the margins of the industry players. Some of the financial transaction services companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA and Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. BFH are set to report their quarterly earnings on Jan 26.The financial transaction services space is housed within the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). The latest Earnings Preview indicates that the total earnings of business services companies in the December quarter are projected to decline 1.5% year over year, while revenues of these companies are expected to jump 3.6%.Factors at PlayThe top line of financial transaction services industry participants is likely to have benefited from growing transaction volumes, resulting from improved consumer spending in the December quarter. Despite continued inflationary headwinds, consumer spending might have witnessed an uptick in the to-be-reported quarter, thanks to strong wage gains (attributable to a tight labor market) and increased personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic.One of the long-lasting trends resulting from the pandemic – digitization – is expected to have boosted quarterly performances of financial transaction services’ stocks in the December quarter. To harness the trend of growing inclination toward digital means, numerous efforts in the form of partnerships and significant investments pursued by the companies in discussion are likely to have contributed to their performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The abovementioned efforts have equipped the industry players to come up with upgraded debit or credit card offerings as well as an enhanced contactless payment solutions suite. Increased utilization of these advanced offerings and solutions while pursuing any transaction is expected to have contributed to the revenue growth of financial transaction services stocks.Story continuesThe easing of border restrictions and gradual gaining of confidence in traveling are expected to have led to rebounding cross-border travel. These, in turn, might have aided cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers during the December quarter.In an attempt to come up with enhanced digital offerings, the companies in discussion frequently resort to substantial investments for pursuing technology upgrades. An escalating expense level arising from continuous technology investments is likely to have dampened their margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Let’s find out how the following financial transaction services stocks are placed before their December quarter earnings on Jan 26.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Visa: This leader in digital payments is expected to have been aided by increased travel and entertainment-related spending in the to-be-reported quarter.

342,f04afda2-3ef2-342b-aef1-587acc17cb6d,V,2023-01-26,Visa (NYSE:V) Is Investing Its Capital With Increasing Efficiency,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-nyse-v-investing-capital-140018080.html,1674655218,STORY,['V'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Visa's (NYSE:V) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Visa is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$20b ÷ (US$86b - US$21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Visa has an ROCE of 31%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Visa roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Visa compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Visa here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEVisa has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 43% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Our Take On Visa's ROCEAs discussed above, Visa appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And with a respectable 86% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Visa  that we think you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

V may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Visa is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for V in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.02 per share for V, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for V, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.77% heading into earnings season.Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that V has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion.

We anticipate that the acquired businesses will generate full year 2023 sales of approximately $100 million and we expect to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter of 2023, subject to satisfying certain standard closing conditions.""First Quarter 2023 OutlookThe current economic environment remains uncertain. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we have seen some continued moderation in demand in the communications-related markets. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter of 2023, Amphenol expects sales to be in the range of $2.840 billion to $2.900 billion. This represents a 2% to 4% decline over the first quarter of 2022 and includes a two percentage point negative currency impact. Adjusted Diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67, representing a 3% decline to flat over the first quarter of 2022.""Despite the ongoing challenges and uncertainties around the world, we are very pleased with the Company’s strong fourth quarter and full year 2022 results,"" Mr. Norwitt continued. ""The revolution in electronics continues to accelerate, creating exciting and dynamic long-term growth opportunities for Amphenol across each of our diversified end markets. Our ongoing drive to leverage our competitive advantages and create sustained financial strength, as well as our initiatives to expand our product offerings, both organically and through our acquisition program, have created an excellent base for the Company’s future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to continue to dynamically adjust to changing market conditions, to capitalize on the wide array of growth opportunities that arise in all market cycles and to continue to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Most importantly, I remain truly grateful to our team for their extraordinary efforts in navigating the myriad of challenges around the world while continuing to strongly support our customers and drive outstanding operating performance.""Conference Call and Webcast DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results at 1:00 PM (EST) on Wednesday, January 25, 2023.

risks and difficulties in trying to compete successfully on the basis of technology innovation, product quality and performance, price, customer service and delivery time; the Company’s dependence on end market dynamics to sell its products, particularly in the communications, automotive and military end markets, pricing pressures resulting from large customers that regularly exert pressure on their suppliers, including the Company, and changes in defense expenditures of the U.S. and non-U.S. governments, which are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, all of which could adversely affect our operating results; difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; events beyond the Company’s control that could lead to an inability to meet its financial and other covenants and requirements, which could result in a default under the Company’s revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan credit facility or any of our various senior notes; risks associated with the Company’s inability to access the global capital markets on favorable terms, including as a result of significant deterioration of general economic or capital market conditions, or as a result of a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating;

governmental export and import controls as well as sanctions and trade embargoes that certain of our products may be subject to, including export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws;

(TSE:ELEF) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 22% in the last month. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Silver Elephant Mining Silver Elephant Mining hasn't yet reported any revenue, so it's as much a business idea as an actual business. This state of affairs suggests that venture capitalists won't provide funds on attractive terms. So it seems shareholders are too busy dreaming about the progress to come than dwelling on the current (lack of) revenue. It seems likely some shareholders believe that Silver Elephant Mining will discover or develop fossil fuel before too long.Companies that lack both meaningful revenue and profits are usually considered high risk. There was already a significant chance that they would need more money for business development, and indeed they recently put themselves at the mercy of capital markets and raised equity. So the share price itself impacts the value of the shares (as it determines the cost of capital). While some such companies do very well over the long term, others become hyped up by promoters before eventually falling back down to earth, and going bankrupt (or being recapitalized). Silver Elephant Mining has already given some investors a taste of the bitter losses that high risk investing can cause.Silver Elephant Mining had liabilities exceeding cash when it last reported, according to our data. That made it extremely high risk, in our view. But since the share price has dived 31% per year, over 5 years , it looks like some investors think it's time to abandon ship, so to speak, even though the cash reserves look a little better with the capital raising. You can click on the image below to see (in greater detail) how Silver Elephant Mining's cash levels have changed over time.Story continuesdebt-equity-history-analysisIn reality it's hard to have much certainty when valuing a business that has neither revenue or profit. What if insiders are ditching the stock hand over fist? It would bother me, that's for sure. It costs nothing but a moment of your time to see if we are picking up on any insider selling.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Silver Elephant Mining's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. We note that Silver Elephant Mining's TSR, at 947% is higher than its share price return of -84%. When you consider it hasn't been paying a dividend, this data suggests shareholders have benefitted from a spin-off, or had the opportunity to acquire attractively priced shares in a discounted capital raising.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Silver Elephant Mining had a tough year, with a total loss of 73%, against a market gain of about 3.4%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 60%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Silver Elephant Mining (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

On average across the 50 largest U.S. metros in December, a typical renter faced a 41.4% ($792) lower monthly payment than a starter homeowner.1The markets with the largest monthly savings for renters, ranked by the percent difference between monthly mortgage payments and asking rents, include:Austin, Texas (121.3% or $2,013)San Francisco, Calif. (97.0% or $2,855)Seattle, Wash. (86.1% or $1,772)San Jose, Calif. (83.0% or $2,621)San Diego, Calif. (77.2% or $2,085)Los Angeles, Calif. (74.9% or $2,150)Boston, Mass. (73.1% or $2,097)Portland, Ore. (71.2% or $1,246)Phoenix, Ariz. (70.1% or $1,116)Sacramento, Calif (67.7% or $1,241)""Despite the fact that renting will likely be cheaper than buying in 2023, rental affordability will remain a key issue throughout the year. We expect rents will keep hitting new highs, driven by factors including still-low vacancy rates, lagging new construction and demand from would-be first-time buyers,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""For prospective first-time buyers, the key consideration when figuring out whether to buy or rent is how long you plan to live in your next home. If you're looking for flexibility to move in the shorter term, renting may be your best bet, and still offer opportunities to save if you're able to compromise on factors like proximity to the downtown area. Whereas buying could be the better option if you're planning to stay put for at least five years. Market conditions will play a role, but ultimately the timing comes down to your personal situation, and tools like the Realtor.com® Rent vs. Buy Calculator can help you organize and make sense of the many considerations.""Story continuesIn December, renters faced lower monthly costs than first-time buyers, on average across the 50 largest U.S. metros and in the vast majority (45) of these markets. Additionally, the gap between the cost of renting and buying a similar-sized home widened significantly compared to December 2021. While this was partly attributed to the slowdown in rent growth seen over the past year, December trends indicate that the increase in relative rental affordability was primarily driven by skyrocketing mortgage rates.In December, the U.S. median rental price, $1,712, was $792 lower than a typical monthly starter home payment. Just 12 months ago, the difference was -$174.The widening gap between rents and first-time buying costs is largely attributed to higher starter homeownership monthly costs ($2,504), which grew 37.4% year-over-year in December – more than 10 times faster than rents (+3.2%) during the same period. Furthermore, despite the slowdown in year-over-year rent growth seen in recent months, typical asking rents ended the year up an average of 11.6% year-over-year.Renting was more affordable than first-time buying in 45 of the 50 largest markets in December, up from 30 markets at the same time last year. In the top 10 metros that favored renting over first-time buying (see table below), monthly starter homeownership costs were an average of 82.2% (+$1,920) higher than rents.Just five markets favored starter homeownership over renting in December, in terms of offering lower monthly costs; these were: Memphis, Tenn. (-32.7%), Pittsburgh (-24.1%), Birmingham, Ala. (-23.5%), St. Louis, Mo. (-6.9%) and Baltimore, Md.

It is in talks to sell the stake in Move for more than $3 billion, Reuters has reported.Since the move to renuite Fox and News Corp was first announced in October last year, a number of large shareholders on both sides had opposed the deal.T. Rowe Price, the biggest investor in News Corp with a roughly 12% stake, had previously expressed concerns that the deal would undervalue News Corp. On Wednesday, portfolio manager Vincent DeAugustino cheered News Corp's decision to scrap the deal.""We applaud the decision to forgo such a transaction as News Corp considers other options to unlock value,"" he said in a statement.On Tuesday, activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which had also opposed the proposed reunion of Fox and News Corp, applauded the decision to not move forward.Cowen &amp; Co's Doug Creutz said investors were pleased by the decision to walk away from a potential combination, saying that pressure from investors like T Rowe Price weighed on the Murdoch's decision to pursue the deal.A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders. Fox shares were up about 2% on Wednesday.Story continuesWhile News Corp's decision to sell Move has been positively received, questions now remain on the future of the company's non-media assets, which include its stake in Australian real estate company REA Group Ltd.""The other big question is – does News Corp give their shareholders their pro-rata shares of REA in addition to selling Move? That would clean out the real estate holdings of the company and simplify the structure of News Corp, which is greatly needed as the company is overly complicated,"" said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research.(Reporting by Milana Vinn and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Writing by Anirban Sen; Editing by Daniel Wallis)]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Large cap stocks are preferred by investors because they are typically well-established companies with a strong track record of performance and stability. These stocks are considered less risky than small-cap stocks, which are issued by newer or smaller companies that may be more volatile. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer behavior shifted towards technology-based activities such as online shopping and streaming services. However, as the economy started to recover and people returned to their pre-pandemic habits, some of these tech companies may have seen a decline in business. Despite that, large-cap stocks, including tech plays, have always been an attractive option for investors, since they protect portfolios from market volatility relatively well. Gradient Investments’ Mariann Montagne joined CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ on January 19, and she explained that investors should look for companies that meet or exceed earnings expectations and grow backlogs faster than the overall market. She noted that now is the time to load up on high quality large-cap names, which are reasonably priced and offer a lot of value. Some of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 large cap stocks — companies which have market capitalizations of between $10 billion and $200 billion — that have P/E ratios of less than 10 as of January 24. That means the stocks mentioned in the article are the most popular undervalued large-cap stocks among the elite hedge funds operating in financial markets. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues15 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMost Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 8.51Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar initiated coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve its capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should draw investors' attention to its strong cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks popular among smart investors. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”14. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 4.39Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a Texas-based company that manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services in the United States. On November 28, Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) announced the expansion of its existing stock repurchase plan by $1 billion to a total of nearly $1.5 billion, inclusive of the remaining outstanding authorization at the end of the third quarter of 2022. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds.  On January 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) from $72 to $90 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. He now has more confidence in his belief that residential new construction will ""remain surprisingly resilient"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were bullish on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 5.76 million shares worth $340 million.Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”13. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.37Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

Overall, 50 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of September 2022. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”12. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.75Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. It operates through two segments, Refining &amp; Marketing, and Midstream. In Q3 2022, the company announced a dividend increase of approximately 30% to $0.75 per share.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 24: 6.76Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily focuses on the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company reported Q3 net earnings of $1.9 billion, or $2.88/ per share, and operating cash flow rose 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to consider. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The company's recent purchases and current resources are in line with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s aim of producing up to 5% more annually. However, the rating is neutral because the market is aware of the stock's recent performance, according to the analyst. Additionally, the analyst noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) should use more of its free cash flow to buy back shares in order to improve metrics over time.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 51 hedge funds were bullish on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $642 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.60Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products.

(NYSE:NTR) and has designated it as a Top Pick in a research note titled ""2023 Fertilizer Outlook"". The analyst believes that while fertilizer prices are expected to be lower, it will be partially offset by lower input costs for natural gas. Additionally, the analyst noted that the seasonal peak in demand during spring will provide support for pricing and act as a positive catalyst for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), compared to 48 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $701.8 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“However, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”9. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.98Diamondback Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:FANG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as the oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B.

The company is the largest U.S. natural gas producer and one of the biggest exploration and production companies by volume and resource base. The analyst anticipates modest growth for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) through 2025 due to market access limitations but views the company's overreliance on gas as a ""modest headwind for equity performance"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the largest position holder in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of September 2022, with 6.5 million shares worth $263.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy  has to say about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”7.

(NYSE:VZ)’s investments in building out its 5G network will start to pay off in the future, leading to improved operational and financial performance.

SWK is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2, before the market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stanley Black’s fourth-quarter earnings has remained steady in the past 60 days. SWK delivered better-than-expected results thrice in the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the earnings surprise being 4.1%, on average.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Stanley Black this earnings season.Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseStanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHealthy demand for aerospace fasteners, recovery in narrow-body and wide-body OEM production and robust Engineered Fastening business are expected to have benefited the Industrial Segment in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across most of the portfolio are likely to have aided the segment’s growth in the fourth quarter. Our estimate for the segment’s revenues in the fourth quarter indicates a 4.1% rise from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same indicates a 4.6% rise from the year-ago figure.Stanley Black acquired Excel Industries and MTD Holdings in December 2021. The buyouts boosted its channel opportunities, strengthened innovation capabilities and enhanced product offerings so far and are expected to have contributed to its top-line growth in the fourth quarter.However, persistent weakness in the company’s Tools &amp; Outdoor segment, caused by reduced retail and consumer demand, is expected to have dented its fourth-quarter performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s revenues indicates a 2.3% decrease from the year-ago figure.Also, supply-chain restrictions (primarily semiconductor constraints) and logistics and input cost increases are likely to have exerted pressure on the company’s margins and profitability in the fourth quarter. Adverse foreign currency movements are expected to have impacted SWK’s overseas business revenues.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Stanley Black this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.

In the reported quarter, SWK’s adjusted earnings were 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. However, the bottom line decreased 72.6% from the year-ago quarter’s $2.77. In the quarter under review, Stanley Black’s net sales were $4,119.6 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9%. SWK’s top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,116 million.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies within the broader Industrial Products sector which according to our model have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Caterpillar CAT has an Earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained more than 30% from a two-year low in mid-October, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, which added about 10% in the same period.As such, Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH and First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL have gained 25.7%, 26.3%, 29.2% and 23.3%, respectively, over the past three months. The strong trend is likely to continue in the weeks ahead as the Q4 earnings season picks up pace. Texas Instruments TXN came up with robust results, beating revenue and earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. The result is expected to add fuel to the sector.Easing inflation and hopes of a less hawkish Fed fueled the rally in the overall tech sector. Additionally, the analyst Barclays Capital upped its stance on some chip stocks ahead of earnings, suggesting that the worst might be over for semiconductors (read: Is the Worst Over for Semiconductor Stocks &amp; ETFs?).Semiconductors have been the most important drivers of the overall growth in technology, given the use of chips in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets, to planes and weapons. The demand will continue to trend higher given the increased digitization in various corners like healthcare, transport, financial systems, defense, agriculture and retail, among others.The rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology like cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, 5G and other advanced information technologies should continue to fuel growth. Further, the introduction of expensive and new-generation chips has been leading to an enhancement in the product mix for semiconductors.Some other well-known players in the space, such as Intel INTC, Qualcomm QCOM, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, will report earnings in the coming days. Let’s delve into the financial picture of the companies that have a higher allocation in the above-mentioned ETFs and the power to move the funds up or down as Q4 earnings unfold. SOXQ is largely concentrated on four firms with a combined share of 28.2%, followed by 24.6% for SOXX, 23.1% for SMH and 13.6% for FTXL.Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesInside Our Earnings PredictionIntel is slated to release earnings after market close on Jan 26. It has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter.

While AI has been a well-known buzzword for years, the rollout of ChatGPT has catapulted it to the mainstream. ChatGPT (stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is an AI-powered chatbot that was launched in November 2022 by OpenAI – a company co-founded by some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent names such as Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn founder), Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel (co-founder of Paypal PYPL).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: The BOTZ ETF is up 19% in the past few months and attempting to rebound from a weak 2022.Though ChatGPT is still merely a prototype, users are flocking to the tool due to its surprisingly deep knowledge across many areas and its in-depth responses to queries. Just how powerful is ChatGPT? The bot has passed the medical license, MBA operations, and bar exams – and it will only improve from here.Today we will cover 5 companies at the forefront of the AI revolution:Microsoft MSFT: In 2019, Microsoft backed ChatGPT creator OpenAI with $1 billion in funding. After the hugely successful launch of the ChatGPT prototype, Microsoft announced earlier this week that the software giant would invest another $10 billion over the next ten years. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is converting from a free service to a “freemium” service. The tool is available for free to all. However, premium users can enjoy more rapid response speeds and availability when the bot’s demand is high for $42 per month. Microsoft’s Azure is the primary cloud service provider for ChatGPT. Last night during MSFT's EPS call CEO Satya Nadella confirmed the company's commitment to AI by saying, ""We are committed to help customers use our platforms and tools to do more with less today and innovate for the future in the new era of AI."" Shares rose 5% initially.Nvidia NVDA: Though AI has been in use for years, it has only recently exploded in popularity because the masses are using it. What was holding AI back before? AI platforms such as ChatGPT require immense computing power to process intricate computing tasks. Nvidia is the leader in PC graphic processors, and its technologies are already being used in several AI realms, such as high-performance computing and virtual reality platforms. Nvidia competitors such as Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD also stand to benefit.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: NVDA has soared 50% in 6 months as AI technology goes viral. NVDA is a huge beneficiary of AI adoption.Alphabet GOOGL: Google parent Alphabet is currently the biggest user of AI in its many businesses. Alphabet utilizes AI to:·      Optimize its search engine Google.·      Moderate content that violates policies on its YouTube video platform.·      Spearhead its autonomous driving division Waymo.·      Turn image data into actionable insights in its robotics company Boston Dynamics.Tesla TSLA: Considering that Elon Musk is a co-founder of OpenAi, it should be no surprise that Tesla makes it onto the list. Tesla’s autonomous driving division is at the heart of AI use in real-life situations. Tesla’s autopilot system uses cameras, sensors, and GPS to record information and then uses its AI technology to interpret the information and make decisions at lightning speed. Once the information is used, it is not discarded but instead recorded and leveraged for future use. In other words, the more people use Tesla’s technology, the smarter and safer it will get.The best option for investors looking for a pure play on AI and autonomous driving would be Mobileye MBLY. Mobileye is a leader in the autonomous driving space and supplies its technologies to automakers such as Nio Inc NIO, Ford Motor F, and General Motors GM. Mobileye and Tesla should continue to lead in this space as demand grows due to the drastic increase in distracted driving deaths. Several months ago, CEO Elon Musk hinted that Tesla would soon look to manufacture a futuristic “Robotaxi” which will be an Uber UBER – like rideshare service that can operate without a human driver.Intuitive Surgical ISRG: Like driving, there are many realms that AI proponents believe will be better handled by machine rather than man. One such area is minimally invasive surgery – a medical practice where precision is paramount. Intuitive Surgical is best known for its successful “da Vinci” robotic surgical system which costs $2 million. Currently, surgeons control the device from a console away from the patient and can complete a variety of complex procedures. However, the company is using AI to collect and curate data to lead to better patient outcomes in the future.ConclusionIn the long run, stocks are driven by higher earnings, and higher earnings are driven by innovation. Think back to some of the biggest winning stocks over the past few decades. Netflix NFLX brought streaming to the masses – eliminating the need for Blockbuster video stores. Apple AAPL combined a phone, computer, and camera into one device – forever changing the mobile phone landscape. For this reason, investors need to begin tracking the AI space. Though the space is in its infancy and the use cases have only scratched the surface, investors should expect an influx of investment dollars following the recent success of ChatGPT and more game-changing technology to be unveiled in the coming years. While few public pure plays exist now, in the future, investors should expect new companies to come public and existing companies to derive more and more revenue from this groundbreaking industry.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Research and development expenses climbed 1.2% year over year to $19.6 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $65.8 million fell 1.2% year over year.Adjusted operating profit totaled $17.5 million, reflecting a 2.5% uptick from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the fiscal third quarter contracted 59 bps to 10.8%.Financial PositionNextGen exited third-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $241.6 million compared with $70.7 million at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023 was $35.9 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $36.6 million a year ago.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceNextGen has included the TSI acquisition and the convertible note issuance in its financial outlook for fiscal 2023.NextGen now projects revenues in the range of $642 million-$650 million, up from the earlier projection of $630 million-$640 million for the full fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $639.9 million.Adjusted EPS is continued to be projected in the band of 93-99 cents for the full fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at 98 cents.Our TakeNextGen exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected revenues. The solid uptick in the top line, along with strength in Recurring revenues, is impressive. Robust increases in Subscription services, Managed services, and Transactional and data services revenues in the quarter are encouraging. The improvement in Other non-recurring services revenues is also promising. The buyout of TSI Healthcare also looks promising for the stock.However, NextGen’s lower-than-expected earnings in the quarter are disappointing. The year-over-year decline in Software, hardware, and other non-recurring revenues and lower Support and maintenance revenues are worrying. A decline in Software license and hardware revenues is also worrying. The contraction of both margins also does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Key PicksNextGen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some better-ranked medical stocks with the right combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3, which are expected to post an earnings beat this quarter.McKesson Corporation MCK has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

The bottom line declined 4.7% year over year. However, the adjusted EPS beat our estimate for EPS by 3.4%.GAAP EPS in the quarter was 91 cents compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.04 per share.Revenue DetailsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported revenues of $1.66 billion, which climbed 7.1% from the prior-year quarter. Growth in da Vinci procedure volume contributed to the improvement, which was partially offset by lower system placements and foreign currency impacts. The top line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It missed our estimate for total revenues by 0.32%.Segment DetailsInstruments &amp; AccessoriesRevenues at the segment totaled $940.7 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 11.6%. This can be attributed to da Vinci procedure’s 18% volume growth. This was partially offset by foreign currency impacts. The procedure volume growth in the United States reflects a favorable comparison with the year-ago quarter, given the impact of the Delta variant last year. Procedure volume in China had shown a recovery during the third quarter, which likely had raised investors’ sentiments of continued recovery in the country. However, procedure volume was adversely impacted in China during the fourth quarter, following a resurgence in COVID-19. The company believes that the adverse impact of COVID-19 may continue in China. The negative impact on procedure volume in China is also likely to have contributed to the fall in the price of ISRG stock during after-hours trading on Jan 24.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 188 systems in the fourth quarter, compared with 150 in the prior-year quarter.

The company displayed strong segmental performance in the quarter under review. It witnessed growth in da Vinci procedure volume in the fourth quarter. However, resurgence of COVID-19 raises uncertainty.The contraction in both gross and operating margins reflects rising costs and expenses amid inflationary pressure. However, the margins are likely to improve moving forward in 2023 as operating expenses are anticipated to decline.Lower-than-expected earnings coupled with adverse impact of COVID-19 resurgence on procedure volume in China seem to have dismayed investors. Shares of Intuitive Surgical declined 9.1% during after-hours trading on Jan 24 following dismal fourth-quarter earnings.

382,a2f1ce61-305f-3451-9ef8-a4a582370c7f,MCK,2023-01-26,Reasons to Retain AmerisourceBergen (ABC) in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reasons-retain-amerisourcebergen-abc-portfolio-155903321.html,1674662343,STORY,"['ABC', 'AMN', 'MCK']","[AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC is well-poised for growth on the back of its robust U.S. Healthcare Solutions business and product launches. Intense competition, though, remains a concern.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player have gained 12% compared with the industry’s increase of 4.7% in the past six months. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 0.7% in the same time frame.With a market capitalization of $33.26 billion, AmerisourceBergen is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies, focused on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. The company’s earnings are anticipated to improve 8.6% over the next five years. It beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 2.51%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving Growth?AmerisourceBergen made a strategic evaluation of its reporting structure to represent its expanded international presence, following the buyout of Alliance Healthcare in 2021. As a result, ABC realigned its reporting structure under two reportable segments, namely U.S. Healthcare Solutions and International Healthcare Solutions in fiscal 2022.Following the segment realignment, U.S. Healthcare Solutions consists of the legacy Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment (excluding Proforma), MWI Animal Health, Xcenda, Lash Group and ICS 3PL. The segment benefits from increasing volume and an expanding customer base.Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the segment in the coming quarters.In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, revenues at this segment totaled $54.8 billion, indicating a rise of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis on the back of higher specialty product sales and overall market growth. However, lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments partially offset this upside. Segmental operating income was $578.4 million, up 14% year over year.Story continuesHigher gross profit (which included fees earned from the distribution of government-owned COVID-19 treatments and a gross profit on sales from specialty physician practices) contributed to the upside. With respect to the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenues are expected to grow 6-8%. Operating income at the segment is anticipated to grow 2-4%.In September 2022, AmerisourceBergen signed a definitive agreement to acquire Germany-based PharmaLex Holding GmbH for €1.28 billion ($1.3 billion) in cash. PharmaLex is a leading provider of specialized services for the life sciences industry, owned by funds advised by AUCTUS Capital Partners AG. It has a global reach, with a significant footprint in Europe and the United States, and a growing presence in other parts of the world. The acquisition of this Germany-based company will enhance ABC’s global portfolio of solutions to support manufacturer partners across the pharmaceutical development and commercialization journey.Last year, ABC collaborated with TrakCel, the leading innovator of cellular orchestration solutions, to launch an integrated technology platform for accelerating patient access to prescribed cell and gene therapies and providing complete visibility throughout the treatment process.The acquisition of Alliance Healthcare strongly drove AmerisourceBergen’s international segment revenues in fiscal 2022.Adjusted EPS is estimated to be in the range of $11.30-$11.60 for fiscal 2023, implying 2-5% growth from the fiscal 2022 level. ABC estimates revenue growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2023.What’s Hurting the Stock?AmerisourceBergen operates in a highly competitive pharmaceutical distribution and related healthcare services market. The generic industry is facing consolidation of customers and manufacturers, global competitors and regulatory challenges. ABC encounters additional competition from manufacturers, chain drugstores, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. Increased competition will affect its business.Estimate TrendAmerisourceBergen has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved north to $11.50 per share from $11.48.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $62.24 billion, suggesting growth of 4.4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported number. The earnings estimate of $2.59 per share for the same time-period implies an increase of 0.4% year over year.AmerisourceBergen Corporation PriceAmerisourceBergen Corporation PriceAmerisourceBergen Corporation price | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

383,faadde8a-cd15-3153-bee9-2043cb1f4a52,MCK,2023-01-26,McKesson (MCK) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-mck-reports-next-week-150003415.html,1674658803,STORY,['MCK'],"[The market expects McKesson (MCK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $70.48 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.19% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson?For McKesson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of $6.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.06, delivering a surprise of -1.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McKesson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 24, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.Abbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 results.

Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.Story continuesReconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.Alan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report this morning a solid bottom line for the quarter, exceptional results in our commercial businesses, with higher full year core income and another quarter of attractive margins and strong growth, continued progress addressing the industry-wide loss pressures impacting the Personal Insurance business. Very strong production in all three of our business segments, resulting in consolidated net written premium growth of 10% for the quarter and another quarter of successful execution on the number of important strategic initiatives. Core income for the quarter was $810 million or $3.40 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 12.3%.These results include $362 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year period. Our solid underlying combined ratio of 91.4% reflects very strong performance in both of our commercial segments. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88.3% for the quarter. You will hear from Michael shortly about the progress we are making in Personal Insurance and the roadmap to improve profitability. For the full year, core income of $3 billion or $12.42 per diluted share benefited from higher core income in our commercial segments that was driven by record net earned premiums and strong profitability, including our best ever underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance.Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to return nearly $3 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including more than $2 billion of share repurchases. At the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business. Turning to the top line, thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 10% this quarter to $8.8 billion with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 11% to $4.4 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at an historically high 10.1%. In the property line, which has received a lot of attention post-Ian, renewal premium change accelerated month-by-month in the quarter.Even with continued strong pricing across the board, retention in BI reached a record high 88%. As you have heard us say before, strong retention is a sign of a stable and rational pricing environment. New business in the segment of $558 million increased 10% from the prior year period. Given the attractive returns in the segment, we are pleased with the very strong retention of our high-quality book of business and the strong level of new business. In Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by excellent production in our market leading surety business, where net written premiums were up 18%. Production was also strong in our management liability business, with renewal premium change of 6.3%, retention of 90% and new business, up 23% from a year ago.In Personal Insurance, top line growth was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to address the industry-wide loss pressure. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio over the past year. With another quarter of impressive production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You will hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Our 2022 results cap off a decade of strong and consistent performance. We posted a double-digit return on equity in every year over the last decade with the exception of 2017, a difficult cat year for the industry in which we posted a 9% ROE.In every one of those years, we comfortably covered our cost of equity. And over the last 6 years, we have significantly increased our rate of top line growth. We have accomplished all of this with industry low volatility. Successfully investing in differentiating capabilities has been a significant focus for us and an important contributor to our success. As you can see on Slide 24, over the past 5 years, we have meaningfully increased our overall technology spend. At the same time, through our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency, we have significantly reduced our expense ratio. In addition, we have improved the mix of our technology spend, increasing our spending on strategic initiatives by nearly 70%, while holding routine, but necessary expenditures about flat.The consistency of our results also benefits from the diversification of our business across our three segments. If we look back at the combined ratio over the last 10 years, in 5 of those years, Personal Insurance outperformed business insurance. In the other 5 years, Business Insurance outperformed personal insurance. And our Bond &amp; Specialty business delivered spectacular results in every one of those years. The depth and breadth of our diversified businesses is a key advantage and would be very difficult to replicate. Speaking of our business profile, given the economic instability and geopolitical risk around the world, we feel very good about our concentration in North America, the largest, most advanced and most stable economy in the world, where we have the pole position and plenty of room to grow.With uncertain economic conditions ahead, I will also note we have a strong track record of performance through a variety of challenging environments over many years. We have got the experience, the know-how and the capabilities along with an efficient operating model and a rock solid balance sheet to manage through whatever comes our way. To sum things up, I am grateful to my more than 30,000 colleagues for all they have accomplished this year and over time. Given our strong foundation, our track record of successful innovation and our ambitious roadmap, we are very confident in the outlook for Travelers. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Dan.Dan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $810 million, a very strong result considering the significant impact of cat 73, the winter storm that occurred in late December. Core income for the full year was $3 billion. For the quarter, core return on equity was 12.3%, including the 5.9 percentage point adverse impact of cat 73. For the full year, core ROE was 11.3%. As you heard from Alan, our consistently strong performance has delivered double-digit core ROE in 9 of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6% over that timeframe and our adjusted book value per share has nearly doubled over the past decade. For the quarter, underlying underwriting income of $723 million pre-tax reflected higher levels of earned premium in all three segments and a consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.Terrific underlying combined ratios in both Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty were offset by results in Personal Insurance. Results in all three segments reflected the benefit of earned price that exceeded loss trend. One additional comment on underlying underwriting income. Prior to 2020, the highest level of full year underlying underwriting income we had ever reported was $1.5 billion after-tax. Despite the significant adverse impact of elevated inflation on profitability in Personal Insurance, 2022 marks the third consecutive year with underlying underwriting income above $2 billion after tax. Simply put, our increased premium volumes and diversified portfolio of businesses are generating underwriting profit dollars at a completely different level than where we were just a few years ago.The fourth quarter expense ratio of 27.9% brings the full year expense ratio of 28.5%, our lowest full year expense ratio ever. As we have discussed previously, the improvement in the expense ratio has not been achieved through cutting corners or artificially managing expenses for the short-term. Rather, we have made and continue to make significant investments in technology and other strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our continued success. Our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency has improved our operating leverage. Looking ahead to 2023, we are very comfortable with an expected full year expense ratio in the range of 28.5% to 29%. Our fourth quarter cat losses were $459 million pre-tax. Activity in the quarter was driven by $512 million from the large winter storm in late December, which impacted most of the U.S. as well as Canada while our losses from this event were significant, but were not outsized relative to our modeled estimates for a storm of this size and intensity.Turning to prior year reserve development, we had net favorable development of $185 million pre-tax on a consolidated basis. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $127 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by increased loss estimates for general liability coverages, primarily umbrella, where year-over-year inflation has resulted in more losses reaching excess layers of coverage. The Bond &amp; Specialty segment saw a net favorable development of $51 million, while in Personal Insurance we recorded net favorable PYD of $7 million. After-tax net investment income of $531 million reflected another quarter of improving returns and higher invested assets in the fixed income portfolio and modest returns in the alternative portfolio, which we expected given the downturn in the broader equity markets that occurred during the third quarter.Looking forward to 2023, we expect after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to average above $535 million per quarter with an estimated $515 million in Q1, growing to an estimated $560 million in Q4. Page 21 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our longstanding corporate cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. Consistent with the increase in our annual net written premium volume for property, we increased our retention level to $3.5 billion from the prior $3 billion level. The treaty provides 100% coverage for the $2 billion layer above the $3.5 billion dollar retention.Photo by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashThe per occurrence loss deductible remains unchanged at $100 million. We did not renew the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty, which was only 45% placed in 2022. As we have said previously, we believe that hardening a reinsurance market provides a relative advantage for Travelers. Our consistently strong underwriting results give us an advantage in terms of reinsurance pricing and capacity. That, combined with the fact that we buy less reinsurance than most of our peers, gives us a cost of good sold advantage. We can let that fall to the bottom line or reflected in pricing without compromising our return objectives, making us more competitive for attractive new business opportunities. Overall, while property reinsurance pricing was higher when we consider the level of price increase as well as changes in terms and conditions we are obtaining on our direct written business, we do not expect a noticeable impact on our net underlying loss ratio for property.Also related to the overall reinsurance market as well as the E&amp;S market, you will recall that in 2021 we took a minority ownership stake in Fidelis. Effective January 1, 2023, we have separately entered into an agreement with Fidelis, whereby Travelers will take a 20% quota share on policies issued by Fidelis with effective dates in 2023. The market for Fidelis products is probably as favorable as it has been in 20 years or so and the market was impacted by 9/11, dot-com collapse and Hurricane Katrina. This quota share arrangement allows us to participate in the hard market, while also accelerating our understanding of this marketplace. While strategically valuable and expected to be accretive to earnings, the quota share deal is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results.Our portion of net written premiums from Fidelis is expected to be around $550 million to $600 million for the full year and those premiums will be reflected within the international results of Business Insurance. Detailed terms of the quota share have not been disclosed, but we can share that there is a loss ratio cap to ensure that even a worst case underwriting scenario is boxed to a very manageable impact on Travelers. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $1.3 billion was again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow was once again very strong at $6.5 billion, reflecting the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, strong profitability and paid losses that for the full year were once again less than 90% of incurred losses.As we have said previously, we are assuming that this lower level of payment activity is ultimately a timing issue. In establishing our reserves and pricing our products, we assume that elevated severity related to social inflation has not abated at all. Our substantial cash flows give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio, which increased to $86.7 billion, excluding net unrealized losses at year end. Interest rates increased slightly during the fourth quarter, but spreads narrowed. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.3 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.9 billion after tax at year-end.Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $114 at year-end, up 4% from a year ago. We returned $721 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $220 million and share repurchases of $501 million. For the year, we returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share repurchases. Overall, we had another very good year with strong top line growth in all three business segments, excellent and improved margins in our commercial businesses, our best ever expense ratio and a very strong balance sheet that has us well positioned for whatever economic conditions the future may bring. And now, I will turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.Greg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. We are firing on all cylinders. Segment income for the quarter was $725 million with an all-in combined ratio of 89.5%, both great results. We are once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio, which was also 89.5%, an all-time best fourth quarter result. The underlying loss ratio increased by a little more than 0.5 point as the benefit of earned pricing was more than offset by the comparison to the prior year quarter, which benefited from both a particularly low level of property losses and the favorable impact associated with the pandemic.The increase in the underlying loss ratio was more than offset by a lower expense ratio that benefited from our ongoing strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 11% from the prior year quarter to a fourth quarter record of $4.4 billion, benefiting from strong renewal premium change, high retention and an increase in new business levels. Turning to domestic production for the quarter, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1%, with renewal rate change of 4.5% and record growth in exposure. Retention reached an all-time high at 88%. New business of $558 million was the strongest fourth quarter we have ever produced. At the product level, in addition to what you heard from Alan about pricing in the property line, terms and conditions and the line tightened over the course of the quarter, further improving the price per unit of risk.While not reflected in our production metrics, this improvement in the price per unit of risk will contribute to our profitability over time. In workers' comp, renewal rate change was a little more negative than we have seen in recent quarters, which is a reflection of the strong profitability in the line and the benefit of continued strong exposure growth. Overall, workers' comp renewal premium change was positive in the mid single-digit range and actually a little higher year-over-year. We are pleased with these strong production results and the excellent execution by our colleagues in the field. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases, together with improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to achieve this historically strong retention levels.The pricing gains we achieved in the quarter reflect our deliberate execution, which balanced the persistent headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment with the improvement in profitability across our portfolio after several years of strong pricing. As always, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to maintain profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in select, both renewal premium change of 10.8% and retention of 83% were strong. New business was up 6% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product as well as growth in other lines. We're pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of this business over the last couple of years, while continuing to invest for future growth.In middle market, renewal premium change remained historically strong at 8.8%, while retention of 91% reached an all-time best. New business was up 13% from the prior year quarter. As for full year results, segment income of more than $2.5 billion was exceptional, benefiting from record earned premium in our best-ever underlying combined ratio. In addition, the top line of $17.6 billion and full year retention were both record highs, while new business premiums were near an all-time high. These results were driven by the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages, designed to enable us to continue delivering profitable growth over time.For example, during the year, we advanced our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 46 states as well as launching our new commercial auto product in a handful of states. Both products contain industry-leading segmentation. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing industry-leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. And in our Small Commercial segment, we launched our new front-end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, all while maintaining the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes.And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, as I referenced earlier. I'll note that our full year expense ratio of 29.7% is down more than 2.5 points from the 2016 level. We're proud of these results and the team that produce them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond &amp; Specialty ended a terrific 2022 with another great quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $221 million, up 30% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong and higher earned premium and an exceptionally strong combined ratio, which benefited from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was also strong and improved about 1.5 points from the prior year quarter to a terrific 81.7%, driven by the benefit of earned pricing. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 5%, excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Domestic Surety grew an outstanding 18% in the quarter, driven by an increase in the number of bonds issued and higher average bond premiums.In domestic management liability. Given the strong returns, we're very pleased that we increased retention of point from last quarter to a near record 90%. That's a 4-point improvement from the prior year quarter. Renewal premium change was solid at 6.3%, and we're also pleased that we increased new business 23% from the prior year quarter. Excluding FX, net written premium in our international business contracted modestly from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the impact of the significant decline in merger and acquisition activity on our transactional liability book of business. For the full year, Bond &amp; Specialty produced record earned premiums and an outstanding combined ratio of 75.3%, driving segment income above $900 million for the first time ever.So for both the quarter and year, our results were terrific, driven by excellent execution, returns from our ongoing strategic investments in our competitive advantages and the market-leading value proposition that we offer our customers and distribution partners. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the fourth quarter loss of $61 million and a combined ratio of 105.3% were negatively impacted by the weather event in late December as well as elevated underlying loss activity in both automobile and homeowners and other. While our results aren't meeting our target returns, we are encouraged by our strong marketplace execution as we continue to respond to the loss environment with both increased pricing and non-rate actions. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners, reflecting our focus on improving profitability. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 111.4%.As a reminder, while there is some seasonality in auto every quarter, the fourth quarter typically has an elevated loss ratio driven by things like holiday driving in Northeast winter weather. Over the last 10 years, the fourth quarter underlying loss ratio has been approximately 6 to 7 points above the average for the first three quarters. Seasonality aside, the underlying combined ratio of 110.5% increased 6.7 points from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily related to the continued inflationary impact on vehicle replacement and repair costs, as well as increased claim frequency, which returns to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and higher bodily injury severity. These loss impacts were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a 1-point reduction in the expense ratio.Separately, the current quarter results included a modest impact for the reestimation of prior quarters. We continue to factor our latest view of loss experience into our pricing actions going forward. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 99.4%. This was 21.6 points higher relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses that were 13 points, 2 points higher than the prior year period and a higher underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 82.2% increased 8.8 points. This increase was primarily driven by higher loss severity related to continued labor and material price increases as well as higher non-catastrophe weather losses. This loss pressure was partially offset by the current quarter benefit of earned pricing.Turning to production. Quarterly results reflect our rate and non-rate actions as we seek to manage growth and improve profitability. In domestic automobile, retention moderated this quarter as renewal premium change increased 3 points from the third quarter to 11.4%. New business written premiums declined 3% prior to the prior year compared to the prior year, and policies in force were essentially flat with last quarter as our additional rate and non-rate actions are taking effect. In domestic homeowners and other, we achieved renewal premium change of 14.5% in the fourth quarter. The retention remained strong at 84%. Slide 17 provides a graphical representation of renewal premium change in domestic automobile and homeowners and other. We added this view to highlight our progress with respect to renewal premium change over the last several quarters.The magnitude and speed of our pricing actions simultaneously across both lines of business is significant. As Alan mentioned, we have added over $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio in 2022 as a result of the high levels of renewal premium change. The benefits of this increased pricing will continue to earn into our results over time. Looking ahead to 2023, renewal premium change in both lines of business will increase above these already very strong levels as we continue to take action to improve profitability. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states representing the majority of our business by midyear 2023. In 2022, our team met a challenging environment head-on and took action to address rising costs.We are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will drive improved profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.Abbe Goldstein: Thanks very much, and we're happy to open up for your questions now.See also 15 Most Undervalued NASDAQ Stocks and 12 Cheap Bank Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

387,c44b5690-2245-30c0-a967-0022cc63caa7,APD,2023-01-26,Here's Why Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-air-products-chemicals-120012051.html,1674734412,STORY,['APD'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals What Is Air Products and Chemicals's Net Debt?As you can see below, Air Products and Chemicals had US$7.73b of debt, at September 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$3.34b, its net debt is less, at about US$4.39b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Air Products and Chemicals' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Air Products and Chemicals had liabilities of US$3.47b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$10.0b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.34b as well as receivables valued at US$1.94b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$8.21b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Air Products and Chemicals has a humongous market capitalization of US$69.3b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Air Products and Chemicals has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.2. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 19.2 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Fortunately, Air Products and Chemicals grew its EBIT by 4.4% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Air Products and Chemicals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Looking at the most recent three years, Air Products and Chemicals recorded free cash flow of 27% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That's not great, when it comes to paying down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Air Products and Chemicals's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit to convert EBIT to free cash flow. Considering this range of data points, we think Air Products and Chemicals is in a good position to manage its debt levels. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

It is in talks to sell the stake in Move for more than $3 billion, Reuters has reported.Since the move to renuite Fox and News Corp was first announced in October last year, a number of large shareholders on both sides had opposed the deal.T. Rowe Price, the biggest investor in News Corp with a roughly 12% stake, had previously expressed concerns that the deal would undervalue News Corp. On Wednesday, portfolio manager Vincent DeAugustino cheered News Corp's decision to scrap the deal.""We applaud the decision to forgo such a transaction as News Corp considers other options to unlock value,"" he said in a statement.On Tuesday, activist investment firm Irenic Capital, which had also opposed the proposed reunion of Fox and News Corp, applauded the decision to not move forward.Cowen &amp; Co's Doug Creutz said investors were pleased by the decision to walk away from a potential combination, saying that pressure from investors like T Rowe Price weighed on the Murdoch's decision to pursue the deal.A rally in News Corp shares in recent weeks meant Fox would have had to pay a significant premium for the merger to be agreed, something that the Murdochs did not believe they could justify to shareholders. Fox shares were up about 2% on Wednesday.Story continuesWhile News Corp's decision to sell Move has been positively received, questions now remain on the future of the company's non-media assets, which include its stake in Australian real estate company REA Group Ltd.""The other big question is – does News Corp give their shareholders their pro-rata shares of REA in addition to selling Move? That would clean out the real estate holdings of the company and simplify the structure of News Corp, which is greatly needed as the company is overly complicated,"" said Craig Huber, media analyst at Huber Research.(Reporting by Milana Vinn and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Writing by Anirban Sen; Editing by Daniel Wallis)]"

Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-c-h-robinson-150003816.html,1674658803,STORY,['CHRW'],"[The market expects C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis trucking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -22.4%.Revenues are expected to be $5.6 billion, down 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.64% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for C.H. Robinson?For C.H. Robinson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that C.H. Robinson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that C.H. Robinson would post earnings of $2.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of -17.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.C.H. Robinson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is expected to report EPS of $4.83, up 69.47% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.36 billion, up 25.82% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 2.96% lower. Cummins is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Investors should also note Cummins's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 12.19. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.57, so we one might conclude that Cummins is trading at a discount comparatively.We can also see that CMI currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.34 based on yesterday's closing prices.Story continuesThe Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 226, which puts it in the bottom 11% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

The estimated figure indicates a 280% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 68.2% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the company’s North America Solutions segment generated revenues of $552.3 million, up 88.3% year over year. The positive momentum is most likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, thanks to HP’s impressive scale, technology and further growth in the region’s drilling activity. Considering the improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues of North America Solutions is pegged at $606 million, indicating a significant increase from the prior-year quarter’s level of $341 million.HP is also expected to have benefited from the powerful performance of its International Solutions unit. The company’s fiscal fourth-quarter segment revenues increased to $42.4 million from $17.3 million in the corresponding three-month period of fiscal 2021. With more drilling work in South America, the favorable revenue story is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. As a reflection of this, the consensus mark for fiscal first-quarter International Solutions revenues stands at $46.4 million compared to $37.2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2022.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Helmerich &amp; Payne this season.

Broadband user base increased in the last reported quarter on October 27th (the company is scheduled to report Q4 results on Thursday, January 26th). Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy.

A Boston Consulting Group study found more than 65% of survey participants gained access to home Internet or a device thanks to a Digital Navigator.To demonstrate the impact of these essential change agents, Comcast enlisted teens from a Boys &amp; Girls Club in Detroit to act as Digital Navigators and help local seniors use the Internet more confidently.Comcast is investing in community-based, Digital Navigator and broadband adoption programs across the country through Project UP.The Age of ConnectivityThe Internet connects us to the people and things we love. But, according to a study from the Pew Research Center, Internet users over age 65 are the least likely group to be online. Seniors face unique barriers when it comes to getting online and using new technology due to a digital skills gap. They are also more likely to say they need help learning how to properly use new devices.In ‘The Age of Connectivity,' Comcast brought together two generations and two Lift Zones - community centers which provide free WiFi access and digital resources. The goal was to help seniors feel more comfortable accessing the Internet and discover its unlimited possibilities. Teens from the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan acted as Digital Navigators to help members of St. Patrick Senior Center get online more confidently- because who knows how to navigate the digital world better than teenagers?The teens taught the seniors various digital skills - from surfing the web and creating an email account to ordering groceries online and making video calls with friends and family. They also shared some of their favorite social media apps and helped the seniors create their very first TikTok video. Follow their journey as they put their new skills into practice on the Senior Center's new TikTok account.Story continuesFor seniors, this is probably on a bucket list they didn't even know they had.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. Large cap stocks are preferred by investors because they are typically well-established companies with a strong track record of performance and stability. These stocks are considered less risky than small-cap stocks, which are issued by newer or smaller companies that may be more volatile. During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer behavior shifted towards technology-based activities such as online shopping and streaming services. However, as the economy started to recover and people returned to their pre-pandemic habits, some of these tech companies may have seen a decline in business. Despite that, large-cap stocks, including tech plays, have always been an attractive option for investors, since they protect portfolios from market volatility relatively well. Gradient Investments’ Mariann Montagne joined CNBC’s ‘Power Lunch’ on January 19, and she explained that investors should look for companies that meet or exceed earnings expectations and grow backlogs faster than the overall market. She noted that now is the time to load up on high quality large-cap names, which are reasonably priced and offer a lot of value. Some of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds include General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 15 large cap stocks — companies which have market capitalizations of between $10 billion and $200 billion — that have P/E ratios of less than 10 as of January 24. That means the stocks mentioned in the article are the most popular undervalued large-cap stocks among the elite hedge funds operating in financial markets. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues15 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayMost Undervalued Large Cap Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 8.51Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texas-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company. The company explores for, develops, and produces oil, natural gas liquids, and gas. On January 9, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar initiated coverage of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) with a Buy rating and a $294 price target. He believes that the company will improve its capital efficiencies and focus on higher return projects in 2023, which should draw investors' attention to its strong cash return program and large reserve base in U.S. shale.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 49 hedge funds were long Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management is one of the leading stakeholders of the company, with 686,869 shares worth $148.7 million. Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks popular among smart investors. Here is what Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund has to say about Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) performed well in a strong energy sector. Pioneer stood out recently with a pledge to return a large majority of free cash flow to share owners through dividends and stock buybacks, and ended hedging to give share owners more earnings and dividend potential should oil and gas prices continue to rise.”14. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49P/E Ratio as of January 24: 4.39Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) is a Texas-based company that manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services in the United States. On November 28, Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) announced the expansion of its existing stock repurchase plan by $1 billion to a total of nearly $1.5 billion, inclusive of the remaining outstanding authorization at the end of the third quarter of 2022. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds.  On January 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer raised the firm's price target on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) from $72 to $90 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. He now has more confidence in his belief that residential new construction will ""remain surprisingly resilient"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 49 hedge funds were bullish on Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 53 funds in the prior quarter. Christopher Shackelton and Adam Gray’s Coliseum Capital held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 5.76 million shares worth $340 million.Praetorian Capital made the following comment about Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) produces and distributes building materials, primarily for the home building industry. It trades at a low-single digit cash flow multiple on recent earnings and is using that cash flow to rapidly repurchase shares. One could say that the low multiple is due to peak cyclical earnings. I take a different view and believe that we’re in the early stages of a long-term housing boom caused by migration to low tax states along with a catch-up phase as home construction rates were below trendline over the past decade. I believe that the US needs in excess of 1 million new single-family homes each year, just to provide for population growth, ignoring the other factors. As a result, this business does not appear to be at peak earnings; instead, I believe we are seeing a new baseline for earnings—though the earnings will be quite volatile—particularly if interest rates remain elevated or increase further.”13. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.37Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was founded in 1887 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.

The company returned $1,176 million to equity holders in the third quarter of 2022, a record for shareholder distributions, including $1,122 million of share repurchases and $54 million of base dividends. Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to monitor.  On January 13, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear reiterated an Overweight rating on Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $40 from $42. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), with 8.3 million shares worth $188 million. Overall, 50 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of September 2022. Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers had to say about Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) in its “Carillon Clarivest Capital Appreciation Fund” first-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Stock selection contributed the most while sector allocation was also positive. An underweight to communication services and an overweight to energy helped performance, while an underweight to consumer staples and an overweight to materials detracted. Stock selection was strong within healthcare and materials but was weak within information technology and industrials. Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) increased its quarterly dividend and executed an impressive share buyback that blew by the target it originally announced.”12. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.75Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) is an integrated downstream energy company primarily in the United States. It operates through two segments, Refining &amp; Marketing, and Midstream. In Q3 2022, the company announced a dividend increase of approximately 30% to $0.75 per share.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51P/E Ratio as of January 24: 6.76Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is an independent energy company that primarily focuses on the exploration, development, and production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids in the United States. The company reported Q3 net earnings of $1.9 billion, or $2.88/ per share, and operating cash flow rose 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. It is one of the most undervalued large cap stocks to consider. On January 24, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read initiated coverage of Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) with an Equal Weight rating and a $70 price target. The company's recent purchases and current resources are in line with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)’s aim of producing up to 5% more annually. However, the rating is neutral because the market is aware of the stock's recent performance, according to the analyst. Additionally, the analyst noted that Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) should use more of its free cash flow to buy back shares in order to improve metrics over time.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 51 hedge funds were bullish on Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 10.6 million shares worth $642 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, GoodHeaven Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long-time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high-return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies led us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is most variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”10. Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.60Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) offers potash, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate products.

(NYSE:NTR) and has designated it as a Top Pick in a research note titled ""2023 Fertilizer Outlook"". The analyst believes that while fertilizer prices are expected to be lower, it will be partially offset by lower input costs for natural gas. Additionally, the analyst noted that the seasonal peak in demand during spring will provide support for pricing and act as a positive catalyst for the company.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), compared to 48 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 8.4 million shares worth $701.8 million. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“However, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”9. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55P/E Ratio as of January 24: 5.98Diamondback Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:FANG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as the oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom lines. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating the consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372 mboe/d1 (up from 363-370 mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B.

The company is the largest U.S. natural gas producer and one of the biggest exploration and production companies by volume and resource base. The analyst anticipates modest growth for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) through 2025 due to market access limitations but views the company's overreliance on gas as a ""modest headwind for equity performance"" in 2023.According to Insider Monkey’s data, Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners is the largest position holder in EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) as of September 2022, with 6.5 million shares worth $263.6 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy  has to say about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”7.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.67bUS$3.71bUS$3.57bUS$2.83bUS$3.28bUS$3.17bUS$3.10bUS$3.08bUS$3.08bUS$3.10bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -3.61%Est @ -1.94%Est @ -0.76%Est @ 0.06%Est @ 0.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$4.3kUS$3.1kUS$2.7kUS$2.0kUS$2.1kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.0%) = US$41bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$41b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$38b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$64.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.281. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Devon EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityDVN's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 4 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The increase reflects the broad-based strength of demand across the end-markets served by the company. Year-over-year, fleet productivity increased 5.9% while average original equipment at cost (""OEC"") increased 14.2%. The increases in rental revenue, fleet productivity and average OEC include the impact of the December 2022 Ahern Rentals acquisition.Used equipment sales in the quarter increased 26.2% year-over-year. These sales generated $409 million of proceeds at a GAAP gross margin of 58.9% and an adjusted gross margin8 of 61.6%; this compares with $324 million at a GAAP gross margin of 49.4% and an adjusted gross margin of 52.2% for the same period last year. The gross margin increases were primarily due to strong pricing on used equipment sales and improved channel mix.Net income for the quarter increased 32.8% year-over-year to $639 million, while net income margin increased 210 basis points to 19.4%. Both net income and net income margin were fourth quarter records excluding the fourth quarter of 2017, which included a one-time net income benefit of $689 million associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The year-over-year improvements primarily reflected higher gross margins from rental revenue and used equipment sales, and a reduction in non-rental depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher interest and income tax expenses. Interest expense increased $39 million, or 42%, primarily due to increased average debt, including the debt issued to partially fund the Ahern Rentals acquisition as discussed below, and higher variable debt interest rates. Income tax expense increased $93 million, or 57%. While the effective income tax rate of 28.6% for the quarter reflects a year-over-year increase of 330 basis points, primarily due to the settlement in the quarter of non-recurring prior year tax adjustments, the full-year effective income tax rate was flat year-over-year at 24.9%.Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 25.8% year-over-year to a fourth quarter record of $1.647 billion, while adjusted EBITDA margin increased 280 basis points to 50.0%. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflected a 100 basis point increase in rental margin (excluding depreciation), a 940 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin from used equipment sales and revenue mix benefits.General rentals segment had an increase of 19.1% year-over-year in rental revenue to a fourth quarter record of $2.023 billion. Rental gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 41.6%, primarily due to better fixed cost absorption on higher revenue.Specialty rentals segment rental revenue increased 18.1% year-over-year to a fourth quarter record of $724 million. Rental gross margin increased by 410 basis points to 49.3%, primarily due to better cost performance and fixed cost absorption on higher revenue.Cash flow from operating activities increased 20.2% year-over-year to $4.433 billion for the full-year, and free cash flow, including merger and restructuring related payments, increased 16.5% to $1.764 billion. The increase in free cash flow was mainly due to higher net cash from operating activities, partially offset by higher net rental capital expenditures (purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment), which increased $441 million, and increased purchases of non-rental equipment.Capital management. The company's net leverage ratio was 2.0x at December 31, 2022, as compared to 2.2x at December 31, 2021. In 2022, net debt increased by $1.723 billion, primarily reflecting the use of borrowings to fund the Ahern Rentals acquisition. In 2022, the company executed the following capital management transactions: 1) repurchased $1 billion of common stock, completing the repurchase program that commenced in the first quarter of 2022, 2) redeemed $500 million principal amount of its 5 1/2 percent Senior Notes due 2027, 3) amended and extended its ABL facility, increasing its size by $500 million to $4.25 billion and extending its expiration to June 2027, 4) amended and extended its accounts receivable securitization facility, increasing its size by $200 million to $1.1 billion and extending its expiration to June 2024, 5) entered into an uncommitted short-term financing facility9 pursuant to which it may borrow up to $100 million and 6) issued $1.5 billion principal amount of 6 percent Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (this issuance, together with drawings under the ABL facility, was used to fund the Ahern Rentals acquisition).Total liquidity was $2.896 billion as of December 31, 2022, including $106 million of cash and cash equivalents.Return on invested capital (ROIC)10 increased 240 basis points year-over-year, and 50 basis points sequentially, to a record 12.7% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year and sequential increases in ROIC were primarily due to increased after-tax operating income.Share Repurchase ProgramOn October 24, 2022, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program. The program was subsequently paused through the initial phase of the integration of the $2.0 billion Ahern Rentals acquisition, which closed in December 2022. The company plans to begin repurchases under the program in the first quarter of 2023, and intends to repurchase $1.0 billion of common stock during 2023.Quarterly Dividend ProgramAs part of United Rentals' commitment to a balanced and effective capital allocation strategy intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, the company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend program on January 25, 2023. Under the program, subject to quarterly approval and declaration by the Board of Directors, the dividends will be payable on the fourth Wednesday of the second month of each calendar quarter to stockholders of record as of the second Wednesday of that same month.

The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call.Non-GAAP MeasuresFree cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset purchases and proceeds represent cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charges, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort (as specified in the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K). The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.About United RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the impact of global economic conditions (including inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain constraints, potential trade wars and sanctions and other measures imposed in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and public health crises and epidemics on us, our customers and our suppliers, in the United States and the rest of the world; (2) declines in construction or industrial activity, which could adversely impact our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability; (3) rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; (4) changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix; (5) excess fleet in the equipment rental industry; (6) inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects; (7) trends in oil and natural gas, including significant increases in the prices of oil or natural gas, could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; (8) competition from existing and new competitors; (9) the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate and the industries of our customers, such as those in the construction industry; (10) costs we incur being more than anticipated, including as a result of inflation, and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; (11) our significant indebtedness, which requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; (12) inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, including as a result of volatility and uncertainty in capital markets or increases in interest rates, or at all; (13) incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; (14) noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; (15) restrictive covenants and the amount of borrowings permitted under our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; (16) inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require, including as a result of uncertainty in capital or other financial markets; (17) the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire could have undiscovered liabilities, or that companies or assets that we have acquired or may acquire could involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities, or may be difficult to integrate, and that we may not realize the expected benefits from an acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all; (18) incurrence of impairment charges; (19) fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated; (20) our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; (21) inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; (22) turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel, as well as loss, absenteeism or the inability of employees to work or perform key functions in light of public health crises or epidemics; (23) inability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all, as a result of supply chain disruptions, insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors; (24) increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment; (25) inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect; (26) risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, failure to protect personal information, compliance with data protection laws and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; (27) risks related to climate change and climate change regulation; (28) risks related to our ability to meet our environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal; (29) the fact that our holding company structure requires us to depend in part on distributions from subsidiaries and such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; (30) shortfalls in our insurance coverage; (31) increases in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; (32) incurrence of additional expenses (including indemnification obligations) and other costs in connection with litigation, regulatory and investigatory matters; (33) the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk, and tariffs; (34) the outcome or other potential consequences of regulatory matters and commercial litigation; (35) labor shortages and/or disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, which may impact our productivity and increase our costs, and changes in law that could affect our labor relations or operations generally; and (36) the effect of changes in tax law.For a more complete description of these and other possible risks and uncertainties, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as to our subsequent filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date hereof, and we make no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations._______________A discussion of the company’s full-year 2022 results of operations is included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.Rental revenue includes owned equipment rental revenue, re-rent revenue and ancillary revenue.Fleet productivity reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization and mix on owned equipment rental revenue. See the table below for more information.Net income margin and adjusted EBITDA margin represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), adjusted EPS (earnings per share) and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures as defined in the tables below. See the tables below for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below.The net leverage ratio reflects net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Total liquidity reflects cash and cash equivalents plus availability under the asset-based revolving credit facility (""ABL facility"") and the accounts receivable securitization facility.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below.Used equipment sales adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the fair value mark-up of fleet acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold, as explained further in the tables below.The company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC includes a discussion of this facility, which is referred to therein as the ""Repurchase facility.""The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate of 21% was used to calculate after-tax operating income.UNITED RENTALS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)(In millions, except per share amounts)Three Months EndedYear EndedDecember 31,December 31,2022202120222021Revenues:Equipment rentals$2,747$2,312$10,116$8,207Sales of rental equipment409324965968Sales of new equipment3950154203Contractor supplies sales3229126109Service and other revenues6961281229Total revenues3,2962,77611,6429,716Cost of revenues:Cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation1,0579134,0183,329Depreciation of rental equipment4914391,8531,611Cost of rental equipment sales168164399537Cost of new equipment sales3141124169Cost of contractor supplies sales18218478Cost of service and other revenues4337168139Total cost of revenues1,8081,6156,6465,863Gross profit1,4881,1614,9963,853Selling, general and administrative expenses3783221,4001,199Merger related costs———3Restructuring charge—1—2Non-rental depreciation and amortization8693364372Operating income1,0247453,2322,277Interest expense, net13293445424Other (income) expense, net(3)8(15)7Income before provision for income taxes8956442,8021,846Provision for income taxes256163697460Net income$639$481$2,105$1,386Diluted earnings per share$9.15$6.61$29.65$19.04UNITED RENTALS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)(In millions)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021ASSETSCash and cash equivalents$106$144Accounts receivable, net2,0041,677Inventory232164Prepaid expenses and other assets381166Total current assets2,7232,151Rental equipment, net13,27710,560Property and equipment, net839612Goodwill6,0265,528Other intangible assets, net452615Operating lease right-of-use assets819784Other long-term assets4742Total assets$24,183$20,292LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYShort-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt$161$906Accounts payable1,139816Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,145881Total current liabilities2,4452,603Long-term debt11,2098,779Deferred taxes2,6712,154Operating lease liabilities642621Other long-term liabilities154144Total liabilities17,12114,301Common stock11Additional paid-in capital2,6262,567Retained earnings9,6567,551Treasury stock(4,957)(3,957)Accumulated other comprehensive loss(264)(171)Total stockholders’ equity7,0625,991Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$24,183$20,292UNITED RENTALS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)(In millions)Three Months EndedYear EndedDecember 31,December 31,2022202120222021Cash Flows From Operating Activities:Net income$639$481$2,105$1,386Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization5775322,2171,983Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts441313Gain on sales of rental equipment(241)(160)(566)(431)Gain on sales of non-rental equipment(3)(4)(9)(10)Insurance proceeds from damaged equipment(7)(6)(32)(25)Stock compensation expense, net3230127119Merger related costs———3Restructuring charge—1—2Loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities——1730Increase in deferred taxes407111537268Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of amounts acquired:Increase in accounts receivable(68)(76)(329)(300)Decrease (increase) in inventory81(25)9(Increase) decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets(234)(58)(164)248(Decrease) increase in accounts payable(28)(241)304307Increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities1655323887Net cash provided by operating activities1,2516684,4333,689Cash Flows From Investing Activities:Purchases of rental equipment(980)(690)(3,436)(2,998)Purchases of non-rental equipment and intangible assets(72)(58)(254)(200)Proceeds from sales of rental equipment409324965968Proceeds from sales of non-rental equipment9102430Insurance proceeds from damaged equipment763225Purchases of other companies, net of cash acquired(2,017)(1)(2,340)(1,436)Purchases of investments(2)1(7)—Net cash used in investing activities(2,646)(408)(5,016)(3,611)Cash Flows From Financing Activities:Proceeds from debt4,6661,3349,8858,364Payments of debt(3,215)(1,768)(8,241)(8,462)Payments of financing costs(15)—(24)(8)Common stock repurchased, including tax withholdings for share based compensation (1)(10)(1)(1,068)(34)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,426(435)552(140)Effect of foreign exchange rates(1)(1)(7)4Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents30(176)(38)(58)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period76320144202Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$106$144$106$144Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information:Cash paid for income taxes, net]"

436,b491c024-2576-3983-8ce1-5146f1782726,URI,2023-01-26,MDC Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdc-gears-report-q4-earnings-163204537.html,1674664324,STORY,"['MDC', 'URI', 'OTIS']","[M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.6% and fell 0.5% from the year-ago period. Yet, revenues of this homebuilding company grew 10.8% year over year and topped the consensus mark by 2.6%.Markedly, MDC reported better-than-expected earnings in seven of the last 10 quarters.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has remained stable at $1.53 per share. This indicates a 30.8% decrease from the year-ago earnings of $2.21 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $1.34 billion, suggesting an 8.4% year-over-year decline.M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseM.D.C. Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteMDC’s Homebuilding revenues are expected to have declined in the fourth quarter from the year-ago level due to soft housing demand and prevailing industry headwinds. The U.S. housing market has been grappling with uncertainties arising from high mortgage rates. This may have impacted the company’s revenues and orders in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Home Sales revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, suggesting an 8.2% decrease from a year ago. The same for units delivered is pegged at 2,284 units, implying a decline from 2,663 units reported in the year-ago period. The company expects homes deliveries between 2,200 and 2,500 for the to-be-reported quarter, depicting a fall from 2,564 units a year ago.It expects the average selling price or ASP, of homes delivered for the quarter to be between $570,000-$580,000, indicating an increase from $461,000 a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling price is pegged at $572,000 per home, suggesting 6.1% year-over-year growth.The consensus estimate for net new orders is currently pegged at 1,278, which suggests a 51.7% decrease from a year ago. The consensus estimate for backlog is 4,332 units, implying a 43.3% decline from fourth-quarter 2021.Also, higher land, labor and material costs are expected to reflect on fourth-quarter’s margins to some extent. The company has been witnessing significant supply-chain disruptions, including shortages and delayed delivery of certain building materials and a tight labor market. These may have created difficulties for MDC in fulfilling customer demand, thereby affecting deliveries. MDC anticipates Housing gross margin (excluding impairments and warranty adjustments) to be 20-22% compared with 22% reported in the prior-year period.For the fourth quarter, lower lumber prices and a higher average price of settlements are likely to have helped this leading homebuilder. In addition, the company’s Build-to-Order process and affordable product offerings may have somewhat aided the top line.Furthermore, MDC’s consistent focus on the mortgage business is expected to have aided revenues in the quarter to be reported. Also, its Financial Services revenues are improving year over year. Yet, the consensus mark for Financial Services revenues of $28.5 million suggests a fall from $32.18 million reported a year ago.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MDC for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.02% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.03%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 5.44%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the software maker had gained 10.77% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 11.1% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.57% in that time.Oracle will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Oracle is projected to report earnings of $1.19 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.31%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the year-ago period.ORCL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.91 per share and revenue of $49.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +0.2% and +17.19%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.18% lower. Oracle is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Oracle is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 18.28. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.47.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that ORCL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.29. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. ORCL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.07 as of yesterday's close.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 108, putting it in the top 43% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(MU): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-micron-technology-140002293.html,1674655202,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +22.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has gained 22.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -129.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.09 points to a change of -125% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -11.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.08 indicates a change of +151.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -31.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -51.1%. The $16.4 billion and $22.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -46.7% and +39.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $4.09 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -46.9%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was -100%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Comcast have declined -17.4% over the past year against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -23.1% and the S&amp;P 500 index's -8.9% pullback. The company persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.On the positive side, Comcast should continue to benefit from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the third quarter. Broadband user base increased in the last reported quarter on October 27th (the company is scheduled to report Q4 results on Thursday, January 26th). Comcast’s plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast’s profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Aon shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the past year (+21.2% vs. +14.4%). The company’s top line has been growing on buyouts and alliances, which have enhanced its capabilities and made it one of the largest insurance brokers. Solid Reinsurance Solutions and Commercial Risk Solutions segments continue to drive the top line.Aon has been divesting non-core operations to streamline its business. It expects that focusing on more profitable operations will generate a higher return on equity. Its pooled employer plan has reached the milestone of $1 billion in U.S. assets and commitments.The company engages in prudent capital deployment. It had around $6.7 billion fund left under its share buyback program as of Sep 30, 2022. Yet, elevated operating costs can put pressure on margins.

The company remains focused on improving the quality of its products and services and operating efficiencies to achieve sustained improvement in earnings and cash flow. It prioritizes improving its business operating system and innovation through business transformation initiatives and prudent investments.Trane has a track record of repurchasing shares and paying dividends consistently. Such moves instil investor confidence and positively impact the company's bottom line.However, product and service diversity put's Trane in the face of fierce competition in terms of price, quantity, delivery, service, support, technology and innovation. The company’s business experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Lower liquidity remains a concern.

(Reuters) - Shareholders can sue McDonald Corp's former global chief people officer for the damage they claim he caused to the restaurant chain by allegedly allowing a culture of sexual harassment to flourish, according to a groundbreaking legal ruling.The decision marks the first time the influential Delaware Court of Chancery has recognized that corporate officers owe the company a legal duty of oversight, which has traditionally been an obligation solely of directors.The decision by Vice Chancellor Travis Laster allows McDonald's shareholders to proceed to trial to try to prove that David Fairhurst, global chief people officer from 2015 to 2019, breached his oversight duties by allegedly acting in bad faith and ignoring signs of a toxic culture.Fairhurst had argued he could not be sued because Delaware judges had always held that oversight obligations sit with the board of directors, who monitor the officers.Laster said that much of the day-to-day operations of a company are carried out by its officers and that arguing they have no oversight obligations would produce almost illogical outcomes.""It would seem hard to argue that, simply by virtue of being an officer, the chief compliance officer could not owe a duty of oversight,"" Laster wrote.An attorney for shareholders declined to comment and McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shareholders are suing Fairhurst on behalf of McDonald's in what is known as a derivative lawsuit. Any damages that are awarded are paid to the company and might include clawing back Fairhurst's remuneration or compensation for damage done to McDonald's reputation, which will be determined at trial.Fairhurst became the global chief people officer soon after Stephen Easterbrook was named chief executive officer.Both were fired in 2019 in the wake of allegations of personal sexual misconduct.Easterbrook agreed in December to pay the company $105 million to settle allegations that he lied to cover up sexual relationships with employees. As a result, he was dismissed from the shareholder lawsuit.(Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Bradley Perrett)]"

BJRI is poised to benefit from digital efforts, off-premise business and sales-building initiatives. Also, the emphasis on the expansion of the remodel program bodes well. However, the rise in food cost inflation and marketing expenses are headwinds.Let us delve into the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Driving GrowthBJ’s Restaurants is investing in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. To attract more customers, the company rolled out several initiatives like digital check-ins, digital menus and digital payment options. Notably, the company continues to drive awareness in its key markets through greater and more targeted marketing. This company emphasized on refreshing its e-commerce platform with a new modern user experience and advanced functionality. The new platform focuses on a personalized and one-to-one approach to digital marketing. It also offers personalized content and dynamic recommendations for the enhancement of guest interaction. Given the applied learnings coupled with fine-tuning of the program, the company anticipates the initiative to drive growth in the upcoming periods.Even though the company reopened the majority of its dining rooms with limited capacity, its off-premise operations continue to be a driving factor for overall sales. The company is working on a number of initiatives to boost its off-premise experience. To this end, it initiated the piloting of a digital order tracker and integrated it with the digital curbside check-in portal. Also, the company upgraded its front-end order and pickup technology to boost convenience and order accuracy. The initiatives are likely to benefit the company, going forward.Moreover, the company implemented several sales-building initiatives to boost sales from its dine-in services. The company began testing its beer subscription service in a group of Northern California restaurants. Notably, high customer engagement is being witnessed on the back of new beer releases along with program benefits. The company plans to expand this program at most of its California restaurants and other states.The company focuses on pilot remodels, concerning dining room capacity expansion and new design elements, to drive growth. It expanded the initiative to seven restaurants and reported solid sales from the remodeled locations. Backed by positive customer feedback, the company is optimistic in this regard and expects to proceed with the initiative in the upcoming period. It intends to remodel two patios in the fourth quarter to boost its operational capacity and drive growth.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 36.8% compared with the industry’s 15% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsBJ’s Restaurants is continuously shouldering increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. Higher food inflationary costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are weighing on the company’s margins. In the fiscal third quarter, labor costs (as a percentage of sales) were 37.7%, up 50 basis points year over year. Occupancy and operating costs (as a percentage of sales) were 24.7%, up from 24.4% reported in the year-ago quarter.Although most dining services are open, traffic is still low compared with the pre-pandemic level.

It is also forecasting a better-than-expected earnings per share number for the quarter, estimating $2.54 a share, which is above the average Wall Street estimate of $2.45.“The company’s unmatched scale and operational resilience has created strong global momentum, particularly in U.S., where traffic is positive,” the analysts wrote in a note. “We believe MCD is positioned to win regardless of the economic situation.”They noted that in the 2008-2009 recession, Mcdonald's was the only public restaurant company to show positive earnings revisions throughout the downturn.Shares of Mcdonald's rose 0.5% on Wednesday and are up 2.7% for this year and 8% over the past 12 months. Oppenheimer rates the stock an outperform with a price target of $304, implying a 12% upside from current trading levels.McDonald’s latest strategy, which it is calling “Accelerating the Arches 2.0” puts a focus on marketing, core products and an emphasis on delivery, digital, drive-thru and development, including ways to improve its classic menu selections such as the Big Mac and the Chicken McNugget.The strategy “represents an under-appreciated catalyst to elevate unit growth and enhance operating margins,” Oppenheimer wrote in a note on Wednesday.For the fourth quarter, Oppenheimer forecasts an 8.5% jump in same store sales, versus the Street consensus of 8.1%.The firm is also modeling earnings for 2023 in excess of the Street consensus, at $10.73 a share versus the average analyst estimate of $10.59 a share.Related ArticlesStory continuesMcDonald's seen getting a Q4 boost from same store sales, analysts sayU.S. safety board chair rebukes Ethiopia over Boeing 737 MAX reportFDA classifies recall of Getinge's heart devices as most serious]"
447,60b1d3e4-c068-310c-9cca-1d41c54bda7f,MCD,2023-01-26,Analysts Estimate Brinker International (EAT) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-brinker-international-eat-150003975.html,1674658803,STORY,"['EAT', 'MCD']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Brinker International (EAT) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis operator of restaurant chains Chili's Grill &amp; Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.6%.Revenues are expected to be $987.59 million, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Brinker International?For Brinker International, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Brinker International will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Brinker International would post a loss of $0.60 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.57, delivering a surprise of +5%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Brinker International doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMcDonald's (MCD), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.45 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.71 billion, down 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for McDonald's has been revised 1.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.59%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McDonald's will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 4.3%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.45 per share, indicating growth of 9.9% from $2.23 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. For revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5,713 million, suggesting a deterioration of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Let's take a look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.Factors at PlayMCD's fourth-quarter top line is likely to have negatively impacted by decline in international operated markets revenues. The company’s performance in China is likely to have affected by softening economy and COVID-19-related restrictions. We expect total international operated markets revenues in fourth-quarter 2022 to be down nearly 31.5%, year over year.However, robust performance of the U.S. segment is likely to have boosted the top line. We expect total U.S. segment revenues in fourth-quarter 2022 to be up nearly 3%, year over year.Robust comps growth is likely to drive the company’s performance. In fourth-quarter 2022, we expect comps to improve 0.8%.Digital efforts, strong marketing campaigns, robust drive-thru presence and expansion initiatives are likely to have aided the results. Moreover, increase in average check growth, menu price increases and compelling value programs also bode well.  Over the past year, the delivery sales mix has doubled in Australia, Canada and the United States.McDonald's Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcDonald's Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMcDonald's Corporation price-eps-surprise | McDonald's Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for McDonald's this time around.

This compares to earnings of $2.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 45.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electronic storage maker would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of -29.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Seagate , which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $1.89 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.58%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.12 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Seagate shares have added about 18.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Seagate?While Seagate has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Seagate: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.42 on $1.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.68 on $7.96 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the bottom 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.IQVIA Holdings (IQV), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This clinical testing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.2%.

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company.These non-GAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company’s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry.SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLCRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)(Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedFor the Six Months EndedDecember 30,2022December 31,2021December 30,2022December 31,2021GAAP Gross Profit$246$948$728$1,904Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts39—39—Amortization of acquired intangible assets1122Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees108—108—Share-based compensation891618Other charges1—1—Non-GAAP Gross Profit$403$958$901$1,924GAAP Gross Margin13.0%30.4%18.6%30.6%Non-GAAP Gross Margin21.4%30.7%23.0%30.9%GAAP Operating Expenses$406$368$781$738Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts——(22)—Amortization of acquired intangible assets—(3)(3)(6)Restructuring and other, net(81)(1)(90)(2)Share-based compensation(25)(27)(46)(52)Other charges(6)—(12)(2)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses$294$337$608$676GAAP (Loss) Income From Operations$(160)$580$(53)$1,166Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts39—61—Amortization of acquired intangible assets1458Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees108—108—Restructuring and other, net811902Share-based compensation33366270Other charges7—132Non-GAAP Income From Operations$109$621$293$1,248GAAP Operating Margin(8.5)%18.6%(1.4)%18.7%Non-GAAP Operating Margin5.8%19.9%7.5%20.0%SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLCRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)(Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedFor the Six Months EndedDecember 30,2022December 31,2021December 30,2022December 31,2021GAAP Net (Loss) Income$(33)$501$(4)$1,027Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts39—61—Amortization of acquired intangible assets1458Net (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and debt modification costs(204)1(204)1Pandemic-related lockdown charges——7—Purchase order cancellation fees108—108—Restructuring and other, net811902Share-based compensation33366270Strategic investment losses (gains) recognized—2—(7)Other charges7—132Income tax adjustments2(2)(3)(16)Non-GAAP Net Income$34$543$135$1,087GAAP Diluted Net (Loss) Income Per Share$(0.16)$2.23$(0.02)$4.50Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts0.19—0.29—Amortization of acquired intangible assets—0.020.020.04Net (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and debt modification costs(0.99)—(0.98)—Pandemic-related lockdown charges——0.03—Purchase order cancellation fees0.52—0.52—Restructuring and other, net0.39—0.430.01Share-based compensation0.160.160.300.31Strategic investment losses (gains) recognized—0.01—(0.03)Other charges0.04—0.070.01Income tax adjustments0.01(0.01)(0.01)(0.07)Non-GAAP Diluted Net Income Per Share1$0.16$2.41$0.65$4.77Shares used in diluted net (loss) income per share calculationGAAP206225207228Non-GAAP207225209228GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities$251$521$496$1,017Acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements7995212212Free Cash Flow$172$426$284$8051 For the three and six months ended December 30, 2022, GAAP diluted net loss per share is computed using weighted average basic shares of 206 million and 207 million, respectively, as a result of the net loss reported during these periods.The Company’s Non-GAAP measures are adjusted for the following items:Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving effortsThese expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures due to the inconsistency in amount and frequency and are excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Amortization of acquired intangible assetsThe Company records expense from amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations over their estimated useful lives. Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Net (gain) recognized from early redemption of debt and debt modification costsFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments. The gains and losses represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished less the write-off of any unamortized debt issuance costs and discount. Fees include certain costs associated with a debt extinguishment or modification. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods' operating performance.Pandemic-related lockdown chargesPandemic-related lockdown charges are factory under-utilization costs incurred due to the pandemic-related lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Purchase order cancellation feesPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Restructuring and other, netRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company’s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Share-based compensationThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.Strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment chargesFrom time to time, the Company incurs losses, gains or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Other chargesThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods’ operating performance.Income tax adjustmentsProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.Free cash flowFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities, and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230125005212/en/ContactsInvestor Relations Contact: Shanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600shanye.hudson@seagate.comMedia Contact: Gregory Belloni, (415) 235-9092gregory.belloni@seagate.com]"

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.Ken Hastings: Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller. As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.Preston Feight: Hey, good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our record fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as other business highlights. First, I appreciate our outstanding PACCAR employees. They consistently deliver the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions to our customers and excellent financial results for our shareholders. They're truly an impressive team. In 2022, PACCAR achieved record annual revenues of $28.8 billion and record net income of $3.01 billion. PACCAR's financial performance benefited from strong business growth across all of PACCAR's major truck markets, and record results in our parts and financial services divisions. PACCAR has achieved 84 consecutive years of net income and has paid a dividend every year since 1941.Story continuesIn 2022, PACCAR declared dividends of $4.19 per share and announced a 50% stock dividend. PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were record $8.1 billion and quarterly net income increased from the prior year by 78% to a record $921 million. PACCAR Parts achieved fourth quarter revenues of $1.47 billion and record pretax profits of $380 million, which was 23% increase compared to the same period last year. PACCAR delivered 51,600 trucks during the fourth quarter. This was 7,300 more than the third quarter and was a result of higher truck production, and the completion of nearly all the vehicles that were awaiting components. The supply chain is improving, though there may be some supplier constraints throughout the year. In the first quarter of 2023 deliveries are forecast to be strong and in the range of 49,000 to 53,000.In 2022, US and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 283,500 units. PACCAR's market share increased to 29.8%. The US economy is projected to expand modestly in 2023. In this truck sector, there's pent-up demand from the prior three years of industry under production, and customers need to replace aging fleets to benefit from the superior performance of the newer Kenworth and Peterbilt models. The 2023 US and Canadian Class 8 truck market deliveries are forecast to be in a range of 270,000 to 310,000 vehicles. European above 16-ton truck registrations were 298,000 last year, and DAF market share increased to a record 17.3% reflecting the success of the new generation of DAF trucks. In 2023, confidence in the European economy is growing and with pent up demand for new trucks we expect the above 16-ton truck registrations to be in the range of 270,000 to 310,000.In 2022, the South American above 16-ton truck market was 138,300. And this year, the South American market is expected to be in the range of 125,000 to 135,000 units. In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 6.9% share in the above 16-ton market, up from 5.7% last year. DAF Brazil has gross steadily since we opened the factory 10 years ago, and makes a healthy contribution to PACCAR's global success. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins expanded to 15.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong global performance, higher truck deliveries, excellent parts of business and supply chain improvements. We estimate PACCAR's worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to be in the range of 16% to 17%. In 2022, PACCAR and its customers realize the financial benefits of the new range of heavy and medium duty Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks.Photo by Zetong Li on UnsplashThese new trucks are successful in the market due to their premium quality, excellent fuel efficiency and low operating costs. Last year, PACCAR earned recognition in several areas. The new DAF XG distribution and vocational truck was named the 2023 International Truck of the Year. Kenworth and Peterbilt earn six manufacturing leadership awards from the National Association of Manufacturers. The reporting firm CDP again recognized PACCAR as an environmental leader with an elite A rating. This rating places PACCAR in the top 1.5% of over 18,000 reporting companies. And PACCAR was recognized as a top place for Women to Work by the Women and Trucking Organization for the fifth consecutive year. Demand is strong in all markets for PACCAR's industry leading new trucks and transportation solutions.And we look forward to 2023 being another excellent year. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?Harrie Schippers: Thank you, Preston. In 2022, PACCAR Parts set new records for annual revenues and profits. Annual revenues increased by 17% to $5.8 billion and annual pretax profit increased by 30% to $1.45 billion. Annual gross margins expanded to 30.4% from 28.6% in the prior year. PACCAR Parts is a high margin and high growth business. PACCAR Parts expanded its global distribution network in 2022 by opening a new parts distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky, and its 18 PDCs worldwide. We estimate Parts sales to grow by 10% to 13% in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same quarter last year, as high truck utilization contributes to strong global demand for parts. PACCAR Financial Services' fourth quarter pretax income increased to a record $151 million which is a 12% increase from last year.Annual pretax income increased 35% to a record $589 million. Portfolio assets increased to $17.2 billion. The portfolio continues to perform well with very low past due and low credit losses. PACCAR Financial benefited from strong used truck prices in 2022. Last year, PACCAR Financial opened a new retail used truck center in Madrid, Spain, bringing the total to 13 used truck facilities worldwide. This retail used truck centers contribute to higher price realization compared to wholesale channels. In 2023, we expect used truck prices to moderate but remain historically strong. With its larger portfolio and superb credit quality, PACCAR Financial should have another very good year. In 2022, PACCAR invested $505 million in capital project and see another $41 million in research and development.PACCAR's return on invested capital improved to an industry leading 35.2%. In 2023, we are planning capital investments in the range of $525 million to $575 million and R&amp;D expenses will be in the range of $360 million to $410 million as we invest in key technology and innovation projects. These include next generation clean diesel and hydrogen conversion engines, battery and hydrogen electric power trains, autonomous driving systems, connected vehicle services, advanced manufacturing and enhanced distribution capabilities. PACCAR's independent Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers continue to invest in their businesses to provide our customers the highest level of service in the industry. These investments are enhancing our industry leading distribution network, making a significant contribution to PACCAR's long-term success and supporting the growth of PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services.PACCAR had an outstanding year in 2022. And we're very positive about 2023. Thank you, we'd be pleased to answer your questions.See also 12 Best Low Priced Dividend Stocks To Buy and 11 Most Undervalued Foreign Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Rowe Price Group, Inc. TROW may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because T. Rowe is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TROW in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.73 per share for TROW, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TROW, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.52% heading into earnings season.T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

460,2fa59666-9e1d-3bf0-bfc2-8cecd36bc13a,NTAP,2023-01-26,NetApp's (NASDAQ:NTAP) investors will be pleased with their favorable 33% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netapps-nasdaq-ntap-investors-pleased-111502010.html,1674731702,STORY,['NTAP'],"[Vanguard founder Jack Bogle helped spearhead the low-cost index fund, putting average returns within reach of every investor. But you can make superior returns by picking better-than average stocks. For example, the NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) share price is up 21% in the last three years, slightly above the market return. In contrast, the stock is actually down 21% in the last year, suggesting a lack of positive momentum.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for NetApp There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.NetApp was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 7% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.70.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of NetApp, it has a TSR of 33% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that NetApp shareholders are down 18% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 6.9%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NetApp better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  NetApp is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit concerning...NetApp is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230125005793/en/Company Delivered Strong Fourth Quarter Net Sales Increase of 20.7% and Comparable Store Sales Increase of 8.6% Driven by Both Ticket and Transaction GrowthFiscal Year Net Sales Increased 11.6%; Fiscal Year Comparable Store Sales Increased 6.3% with Continued Market Share Gains Across Product CategoriesFourth Quarter Diluted Earnings per Share (""EPS"") Increased 25.9% to $2.43 and Fiscal Year 2022 Diluted EPS Increased 12.8% to $9.71Returned $1.11 Billion of Capital to Shareholders in Fiscal Year 2022""Tractor Supply had another remarkable year in 2022 as we continued to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, while we had an incremental benefit from the late December winter storm, our underlying results were at the high end of our expectations. Our strong results throughout 2022 are directly attributable to the dedication of the more than 50,000 Tractor Supply Team Members who are passionate about Life Out Here. The team achieved significant milestones in the history of Tractor Supply including record sales and profitability and executed meaningful investments to enable future growth. In just over two years since introducing our Life Out Here strategy, we have executed Project Fusion in nearly 30% of our store base, built more than 300 garden centers, expanded our digital and supply chain capabilities and grown our Neighbor’s Club membership 47% to more than 28 million members. These investments are resonating with our customers as we exited the year with strong traffic growth,"" said Hal Lawton, Chief Executive Officer of Tractor Supply.Story continuesLawton continued, ""Tractor Supply’s needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time with consistent and sustainable growth. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, our future couldn’t be brighter. With a solid foundation, we plan to build on our momentum in 2023. We believe we have the right strategies to manage through the near-term and to deliver long-term compounding growth and value creation.""Fourth Quarter 2022 ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 20.7% to $4.01 billion from $3.32 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter included an extra sales week as part of the Company’s 53-week calendar in 2022, which represented 6.8 percentage points of the 20.7% sales growth. Comparable store sales increased 8.6%, as compared to an increase of 12.7% in the prior year’s fourth quarter, driven by comparable average ticket growth of 6.3% and comparable average transaction count increase of 2.3%. Comparable store sales growth reflects continued strength in every day, needs-based merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible (""C.U.E."") products, winter seasonal goods and year-round product categories. The Company estimates comparable store sales in the quarter benefited by approximately two percentage points from the late December winter storm. The acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home in October 2022 added approximately $80 million to net sales in the fourth quarter.Gross profit increased 21.7% to $1.36 billion from $1.12 billion in the prior year’s fourth quarter, and gross margin increased 28 basis points to 34.0% from 33.8% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to the Company’s price management actions and other margin driving initiatives that were able to offset the impact from year-over-year product cost inflation pressures, product mix from the robust growth of C.U.E. products and higher transportation costs.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 21.4% to $1.00 billion from $827.5 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 14 basis points to 25.1% from 24.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to the impact of transaction expenses and early integration costs associated with the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition. Additionally, the Company’s strategic growth initiatives, including related depreciation and amortization, and investments in team member compensation and benefits contributed to the increase. These items were partially offset by a reduction of COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales.Operating income increased 22.6% to $359.2 million compared to $293.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Given the transaction expenses and early integration costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, the impact of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition was relatively neutral to operating income in the fourth quarter and reduced the operating margin rate by approximately 20 basis points.The effective income tax rate improved to 22.4% compared to 22.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021.Net income increased 22.4% to $270.9 million from $221.3 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 25.9% to $2.43 from $1.93 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The benefit of the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.16 to diluted EPS.The Company repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of its common stock for $92.0 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $101.7 million, returning $193.7 million of capital to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2022.The Company opened 39 new Tractor Supply stores and six new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the fourth quarter of 2022. In October 2022, Tractor Supply acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home that will be rebranded to Tractor Supply by the end of 2023.Fiscal 2022 ResultsNet sales for fiscal 2022 increased 11.6% to $14.20 billion from $12.73 billion in fiscal 2021. The fiscal year included an extra sales week as part of the Company’s 53-week calendar in 2022, which represented 1.8 percentage points of the 11.6% sales growth. Comparable store sales increased 6.3% versus a 16.9% increase in fiscal 2021.Gross profit increased 11.1% to $4.97 billion from $4.48 billion in fiscal 2021, and gross margin decreased 17 basis points to 35.0% from 35.2% in fiscal 2021.SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 11.6% to $3.54 billion from $3.17 billion in fiscal 2021. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses were flat at 24.9% compared to fiscal 2021.Operating income increased 9.8% to $1.43 billion compared to $1.31 billion in fiscal 2021.The effective income tax rate was 22.5% compared to 22.1% in fiscal 2021.Net income increased 9.2% to $1.09 billion from $997.1 million, and diluted EPS increased 12.8% to $9.71 from $8.61 in fiscal 2021. The benefit of the 53rd week contributed approximately $0.16 to diluted EPS.In fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of its common stock for $700.1 million. The Company also paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $409.6 million during fiscal 2022, returning $1.11 billion of capital to shareholders.During fiscal 2022, the Company opened 63 new Tractor Supply stores and nine new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores and closed one Petsense by Tractor Supply store. In October 2022, Tractor Supply acquired 81 stores from Orscheln Farm and Home that will be rebranded to Tractor Supply by the end of 2023.Fiscal 2023 Financial OutlookThe Company is providing its financial guidance for fiscal 2023, a 52-week year compared to fiscal 2022, a 53-week year. This outlook is based on what the Company can reasonably predict at this time.For fiscal 2023, the Company expects the following:Net Sales$15.0 billion to $15.3 billionComparable Store Sales+3.5% to +5.5%Operating Margin Rate10.1% to 10.3%Net Income$1.13 billion to $1.17 billionEarnings per Diluted Share$10.30 to $10.60Capital Expenditures$700 million to $775 millionShare Repurchases$575 million to $675 millionAnticipated capital expenditures include plans in 2023 to open approximately 70 Tractor Supply stores, complete the Orscheln Farm and Home conversions to Tractor Supply, continue the Project Fusion remodels and garden center transformations, and open 10 to 15 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.44%.Coming into today, shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had gained 0.16% in the past month. In that same time, the Oils-Energy sector gained 2.6%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.57%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Occidental Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 27, 2023. On that day, Occidental Petroleum is projected to report earnings of $1.85 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 25%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.82 billion, up 10.16% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Occidental Petroleum should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

468,aef4b1ab-7ca3-33d2-b96f-f7d191f995c4,BSX,2023-01-26,Boston Scientific (BSX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-bsx-earnings-expected-150003229.html,1674658803,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific (BSX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.24 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific?For Boston Scientific, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Boston Scientific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of -2.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Boston Scientific appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Andrew?Andrew Young: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $3.03 per diluted common share. For the full year, Capital One earned $7.4 billion or $17.91 per share. Included in the results for the fourth quarter were two adjusting items, which collectively benefited pretax earnings by $105 million. Net of these adjustments, fourth quarter earnings per share were $2.82 and full year earnings performance share were $17.71. On a linked quarter basis, period-end loans grew 3% and average loans grew 2%, driven by growth in our domestic car business. This loan growth coupled with net interest margin expansion drove revenue up 3% on a linked quarter basis.Noninterest expense grew 3% in the linked quarter, driven by an increase in marketing expenses while operating expenses were largely flat. Net of the adjustments I mentioned earlier, operating expenses were up 2.4%. Provision in the quarter -- provision expense in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by net charge-offs of $1.4 billion and an allowance build of about $1 billion. Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $1 billion increase in allowance in the fourth quarter brings our total company year-end allowance balance up to $13.2 billion, increasing the total company coverage ratio by 22 basis points to 4.24%. I'll cover the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $795 million, bringing our coverage ratio to 6.97%.Three things put upward pressure on our card allowance. The first factor was the continued credit normalization in our portfolio. The second factor was a modestly worse economic outlook than our assumption a quarter ago. And finally, we built allowance for the loan growth in the quarter. The impact of the fourth quarter loan growth on the allowance is more muted than typical loan growth given the seasonal nature of these balances. These three factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance increased by $129 million, driving a 20 basis-point increase in coverage to 2.8%. The build was primarily driven by continued credit normalization in our auto business, including lower recovery rates.The second factor also putting upward pressure on our allowance is the impact of a modestly worse economic outlook. These two factors were modestly offset by a release in our qualitative factors. And finally, in our Commercial business, the allowance increased $73 million, resulting in a 9 basis-point increase in coverage to 1.54%. This was largely driven by reserve builds for our office portfolio. Turning to page 6, I'll discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was 143%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Total liquidity reserves increased by $14 billion to $107 billion. Strong consumer deposit growth throughout the quarter drove cash balances higher and allowed us to pay down prior FHLB borrowings.Photo by Scott Graham on UnsplashTurning to page 7, I'll cover our net interest margin. Our net interest margin was 6.84% in the fourth quarter, 24 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and 4 basis points higher than the prior quarter. The 4 basis-point linked quarter increase in NIM was driven by higher asset yields and a balance sheet mix shift towards car loans. This impact was mostly offset by higher deposit and wholesale funding costs. Turning to slide 8, I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the fourth quarter, up about 30 basis points relative to last quarter. The $1.2 billion of net income in the quarter was partially offset by growth in risk-weighted assets, dividends and share repurchases.We repurchased approximately $150 million of common stock in the quarter, bringing the repurchases for the full year to $4.8 billion. We continue to estimate that our longer term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?Richard Fairbank: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome, everybody. I'll begin on slide 10 with fourth quarter results in our Credit Card business. Year-over-year growth in purchase volume and loans, coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which are shown on slide 11. In the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year growth in every top line metric continued in our Domestic Card business. Purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Ending loan balances increased $22.9 billion or about 21% year-over-year. Ending loans grew 8% from the sequential quarter.And revenue was up 19% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin. Both the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate continued to normalize and were below pre-pandemic levels. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 3.2%, up 173 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter-end was 3.43%, 121 basis points above the prior year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 102 basis points and the delinquency rate was up 46 basis points. Noninterest expense was up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2021, which includes an increase in marketing. Total company marketing expense was about $1.1 billion in the quarter. Our choice in domestic card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing.In our Domestic Card business, we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth. We're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decade-long focus on heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows fourth quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see the effects of our choice to pull back on auto growth in response to competitive pricing dynamics that have pressured industry margins. Auto originations declined 32% year-over-year and 20% from the linked quarter.Driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking loan growth continued to be slower than previous quarters. Fourth quarter ending loans grew 3% compared to the year ago quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 2%. Fourth quarter ending deposits in the Consumer Bank were up 6% year-over-year, and up 5% over the sequential quarter. Average deposits were up 4% year-over-year and up 3% from the sequential quarter. Our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to get good traction. Consumer Banking revenue was up 10% year-over-year as growth in auto loans and deposits was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in auto margins. Noninterest expense was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by investments in the digital capabilities of our auto and retail banking businesses and marketing for our national digital bank.The auto charge-off rate and delinquency rate continued to normalize in the fourth quarter. The charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was 1.66%, up 108 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.62%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate was up 61 basis points, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 77 basis points. Slide 13 shows fourth quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, fourth quarter ending loan balances were down 1% and average loans were flat. Ending deposits were down 1% from the linked quarter. Average deposits grew 7%. Fourth quarter revenue was down 23% from the linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven by an internal funds transfer pricing impact that was offset by an equivalent increase in the other category and was therefore neutral to the Company.Excluding this impact, fourth quarter commercial revenue would have been down about 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% year-over-year. Noninterest expense was up 2% from the linked quarter. The Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was 6 basis points. The criticized performing loan rate increased 74 basis points from the linked quarter to 6.71%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was up 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 0.74%. In closing, we continue to drive strong growth in card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the fourth quarter. Loan growth in our Consumer Banking business was slower compared to previous quarters as we continued to pull back on auto originations. Consumer deposits grew. And in our Commercial Banking business, ending loans and deposits were roughly flat compared to the linked quarter.Charge-off rates and delinquency rates continue to normalize across our business and were below pre-pandemic levels. Total company operating expense net of adjustments was up 2.4% from the linked quarter. Our annual operating efficiency ratio for full year 2022 was 44.5% net of adjustments, a 15 basis points improvement from full year 2021. And we expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, we continue to see opportunities for resilient asset growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities. We continue to closely monitor and assess competitive dynamics and economic uncertainty. Powered by our modern digital technology, we're continuously improving our proprietary underwriting, marketing and product capabilities.We're focusing on efficiency improvement and we're managing capital prudently. As a result of our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, we're in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?Jeff Norris: Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&amp;A session. As a courtesy to our other investors and analysts who might wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up.

Adjusted earnings of $2.82 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.81. The bottom line plunged 47.9% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $3.66.Results were adversely impacted by significantly higher provisions. Also, an increase in operating expenses acted as a headwind. Yet, a robust improvement in loan balances and higher interest rates aided net interest income (NII). A rise in non-interest income was another positive.Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.16 billion, plunging 49.4% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $1.40 billion.Adjusted earnings of $17.71 per share for 2022 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.65. The bottom line plunged 34.7% from the year-ago period. Our estimate for earnings was $18.44. Net income (GAAP basis) was $7.04 billion, plunging 41.1% from the prior year. Our estimate for the metric was $7.28 billion.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal quarterly net revenues were $9.04 billion, up 11.4% from the prior-year quarter. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9 billion. We had projected revenues of $8.56 billion.For 2022, revenues were $34.25 billion, up 12.5% from the previous year. The top line marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.20 billion. We had projected revenues of $33.77 billion.Quarterly NII improved 11.6% from the prior-year quarter to $7.20 billion. The net interest margin (NIM) increased 24 basis points (bps) year over year to 6.84%. Our estimates for NII and NIM were $6.83 billion and 6.82%, respectively.Non-interest income of $1.84 billion rose 10.5% year over year. This was primarily attributable to growth in net interchange fees (up 17%) and other income (up 19%). Service charges and other customer-related fees declined 9%. Our estimate for non-interest income was pegged at $1.72 billion.Non-interest expenses were $5.08 billion, rising 8.6% year over year. The increase was due to a rise in almost all cost components, except for other expenses, which declined 33%.

This compares to earnings of $0.94 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters would post earnings of $0.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of 12.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Textron , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $3.64 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.93%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.32 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Textron shares have lost about 1.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for Textron?While Textron has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Textron: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

484,056b854a-1794-3000-b7ec-67557e853662,NSC,2023-01-26,We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) Passed With Ease,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ran-stock-scan-earnings-growth-120156276.html,1674734516,STORY,['NSC'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern How Quickly Is Norfolk Southern Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Norfolk Southern grew its EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Norfolk Southern maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$12b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Norfolk Southern's future profits.Are Norfolk Southern Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Norfolk Southern, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$57m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Story continuesWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Norfolk Southern, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.Norfolk Southern's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$4.4m in the year prior to December 2021. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Norfolk Southern To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Norfolk Southern is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Norfolk Southern, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for Norfolk Southern  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Since its IPO in 2010, Teslawent from being an obscure automotive start-up (the first successful one in the U.S. in over 100 years) to the unquestionable leader in the fastest-growing segment of the car manufacturing market – electric vehicles. The company's success has catapulted CEO Elon Musk to be one of the richest people on the planet, and one of the most popular followers on Twitter, a microblogging social media platform that Musk recently bought.The success of Tesla hasn't gone unnoticed. Traditional automakers are producing more electric vehicles than ever before. They are doing their best to dethrone Musk and Tesla, while startups like Rivian Automotivedo their best to scale.The Ultimate ""Battleground"" StockRecently, shares of Tesla have retreated as the overall equity market fell in 2022, inflation rose rapidly, and demand for EVs slowed. Since its inception, the stock has been a top battleground. Infamous short sellers such as Jim Chanos, famous for shorting Enron before its collapse and Michael Burry who shorted housing in 2008 and was played by Christian Bale in ""The Big Short"" have been outspoken critics. Meanwhile, others have made a fortune on the long side, such as Ron Barron, who founded Barron's, and Larry Ellison, who cofounded Oracle.Regardless of one's view of the stock currently, it is worth paying attention to for all market participants - at the very least. Tesla has been a top performer over the past decade, is worth half a trillion dollars, and is consistently one of the most traded public stocks today.Story continuesTesla Earnings Call: What to Watch ForAs with any Tesla earnings release, there will be new announcements and headlines. Below are the top 5 things to watch in Tesla's Q1 EPS release:1.   Twitter CEO Update: In 2022, Elon Musk ventured into the social realm by purchasing Twitter for $44 billion. Since the acquisition closed, Musk is enjoying himself and has been spending time revamping the microblogging service. However, many Tesla investors and critics do not share Musk's enthusiasm. They want his attention brought back to Tesla and away from his other ventures, such as Twitter and his rocket company SpaceX.Recently, Musk announced that he would be stepping down and ending his controversial time as CEO of Twitter and finding a replacement. Investors should be watching to see if Musk provides any updates in the earnings call on the matter.2.   Clean Energy Update: Investors who have not followed Tesla long may have forgotten about another massive acquisition by Musk: Solar City. As the name implies, Solar City is Tesla's solar company. Thus far, compared to Tesla's EV business, the solar panel business has been disappointing. However, lately, the solar industry has produced several market leaders, including but not limited to First Solar. 3.   New Products &amp; Projects Updates: Tesla followers should be paying attention to updates to:·      Semi-Trucks: Late last year, Tesla delivered the first batch of its semi-truck to a European subsidiary of Coca-Cola·      Full-self Driving: The company may provide updates on the progress of the project from a safety and regulatory perspective.·      Cyber Truck: Tesla is shooting to deliver the first batch of its flashy and Martian-looking SUV concept, the Cyber Truck.·      Gigafactory: While the pace of demand has slowed somewhat recently, the root of Tesla's issues remain supply -driven rather than demand-driven. To fix this issue, the company is expanding its Gigafactory in Texas and planning to add another Gigafactory,4.    EV Credit Commentary: Certain qualifying Tesla models and Tesla customers will be eligible for a $7,500 Federal Tax Credit for the first time in years.5.   China Price Cut: Tesla's China business is seeing massive demand amid a decision by the company to slash prices in the country. Following the announcement a few weeks ago, TSLA shares have soared. Management will likely give color on that decision and the Chinese economy in general. Chinese ADRs such as Alibaba have been on fire to start the new year.As of the time of this writing, the options market is implying a $14 move in shares of Tesla, which is currently trading at $142. After a vicious countertrend rally in January, shares are approaching the underside of the 50-day moving average – a spot that is likely to make or break shares in the short term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

To skip our detailed analysis of the biotech sector, you can go directly to see 5 Cheap Biotech Stocks To Buy.The biotechnology sector has been on the rise over the past three decades. Several forecasts expect the sector to make significant headway through developing cures for various diseases.Some of the more famous names in the biotech space include companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). These companies have steadily been making a name for themselves by producing medical cures and vaccines. Consequently, biotech stocks began soaring last year. According to a Wall Street Journal article published in August 2022, the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF, an equal-weighted fund of biotech stocks, was up by 41.4% in August from its low on May 11. Another fund, iShares Biotechnology ETF, also rose by 21.8% from its low on June 16. A comparison with the S&amp;P 500's performance between June and August shows that the broader benchmark index was only up by 16.9% over the same period. This representation of the biotech sector's outperformance in the market resulted in renewed optimism among investors eyeing the sector, leading to stronger support for biotech stocks on Wall Street.According to a Global Trends report published by the National Intelligence Council's Strategic Futures Group in April 2021, the global bio-economy accounted for about $5 trillion, or nearly 6% of global GDP at the time. The global bio-economy refers to all activity enabled by research and innovation in the life sciences and biotech. The report also mentioned that the global bio-economy could exceed $20 trillion by 2023, based on 10%-15% annual revenue growth trends in the sector. This growth in the biotech sector is expected to arise from a more multidisciplinary and data-intensive approach to the life sciences and biotech over the next two decades. By 2023, we are already beginning to observe an increased usage of biotech by medical professionals and medical diagnostics.  Personal Internet of Things (IoT) devices are also being used to collect higher volumes of health data to be used in predicting new diseases and treatment outcomes in the biotech space. As such, we can expect the sector to continue soaring in the years to come.Story continues12 Cheap Biotech Stocks To Buylouis-reed-pwcKF7L4-no-unsplashLet's now take a look at the 12 cheap biotech stocks to buy.Our MethodologyWe scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 12 biotech stocks with P/E ratios less than 20.

498,839e9f2d-5537-39bf-9091-cc78bb7d5039,WM,2023-01-26,Waste Management (WM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-wm-reports-next-150003450.html,1674658803,STORY,['WM'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Waste Management (WM) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis garbage and recycling hauler is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.98 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.95% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waste Management?For Waste Management, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Waste Management will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Waste Management would post earnings of $1.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.56, delivering a surprise of +4%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Waste Management doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

499,c592a4bd-05a9-3a69-ba03-0494f303c0c2,DVA,2023-01-26,Here's Why You Should Retain DaVita (DVA) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-davita-dva-162704206.html,1674664024,STORY,"['DVA', 'CAH', 'AMN']","[DaVita Inc. DVA is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of strength in its DaVita Kidney Care. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance, along with the acquisition of dialysis centers, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding stiff competition and dependence on commercial payers persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 29.4% compared with 13.9% decline of the industry and an 8.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider has a market capitalization of $6.97 billion. The company projects 8.4% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DaVita’s earnings yield of 8.4% is favorable to the industry’s yield of 3.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.DaVita Kidney Care: We are optimistic about DaVita Kidney Care, the major revenue-generating segment of DVA. It specializes in a broad array of dialysis services, significantly contributing to the company's top line. With respect to DaVita Integrated Kidney Care, as of Sep 30, 2022, the company had approximately 43,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements, representing approximately $3.3 billion in annualized medical spend. DaVita also had an additional 12,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements.Acquisition of Dialysis Centers: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate dialysis centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have boosted the company’s top line to a large extent, raising our optimism.As of Sep 30, 2022, DaVita provided dialysis services to around 243,800 patients at 3,128 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,776 were U.S. centers while 352 were located across 11 other countries. During the third quarter of 2022, the company acquired five dialysis centers in the United States and three dialysis centers outside the United States.Story continuesDaVita’s international dialysis operations have continued to grow steadily and expand on the back of acquiring and developing outpatient dialysis centers in various strategic markets.Strong Q3 Results: DaVita’s solid third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and both its segments’ revenues during the quarter. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and opening of others, both within the United States and overseas, were also encouraging. The increased hospital inpatient dialysis revenues registered during the third quarter were also promising.DownsidesDependence on Commercial Payers: A significant portion of DaVita’s dialysis and related lab services’ revenues are generated from patients who have commercial payers as the primary payers. The payments received from commercial payers are the primary generators of profit. However, there remains a risk of people shifting from commercial insurance schemes to government schemes due to the wide disparity in payment rates in case of a rise in unemployment.Stiff Competition: DaVita, in its U.S. dialysis business, faces intense competition from large and medium-sized providers, among others. U.S. regulations require medical directors for each center. As the company and its competitors continue to grow and open new dialysis centers, DaVita may not be able to retain an adequate number of nephrologists to serve as medical directors.Estimate TrendDaVita is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 17.7% south to $6.32.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, suggesting a 0.1% dip from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fourth-quarter revenue estimate of $2.83 billion, suggesting a 0.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH and Merit Medical Systems, Inc. MMSI.AMN Healthcare, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 3.3%.

The household appliance company is expected to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.For fourth-quarter revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.1 billion, suggesting a 13.2% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has moved up 0.7% in the past 30 days to $3.43, indicating a 44.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter total revenues to decrease 9.6% year over year to $5.3 billion and the bottom line to plunge 47.4% to $3.23 per share.For 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $19.9 billion, suggesting a 9.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings of $19.25 indicates a 27.6% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. We expect the company’s 2022 total revenues to decline 8.8% year over year to $20.1 billion and the bottom line to decrease 28.5% to $19.00 per share.The company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 19.7% in the last reported quarter. However, the bottom line beat estimates by 1.8%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.Key Points to NoteWhirlpool has been reeling under a challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. Global supply-chain disruptions and rising raw material costs, along with the ongoing war in Ukraine and unfavorable currency, are likely to have acted as other headwinds.The company has been witnessing elevated raw materials, freight and logistics costs, as well as energy costs. Management earlier expected cost inflation to persist throughout the first half of 2023. Consequently, raw material inflation was forecast to hurt its margin by 750 bps in 2022.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management trimmed the 2022 view. For 2022, Whirlpool envisioned a net sales decline of 9% to $20.1 billion, which compares unfavorably with the earlier stated $20.7 billion. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool expected earnings per share of $5, down from the $9.50-$11.50 mentioned earlier. On an ongoing basis, the metric was predicted to be $19, down from the prior stated $22-$24.However, the company has been undertaking cost-based pricing efforts to help offset raw material inflation. It has also been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWhirlpool Corporation price-eps-surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Whirlpool this time around.

503,aabab816-52ae-3cfc-a97b-fc0c2b4ee6be,LYB,2023-01-26,What Does LyondellBasell Industries N.V.'s (NYSE:LYB) Share Price Indicate?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-lyondellbasell-industries-n-v-113239398.html,1674732759,STORY,['LYB'],"[Let's talk about the popular LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on LyondellBasell Industries’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries What Is LyondellBasell Industries Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 14% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy LyondellBasell Industries today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $108.13, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that LyondellBasell Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from LyondellBasell Industries?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for LyondellBasell Industries, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? LYB seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LYB for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on LYB should the price fluctuate below its true value.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Be aware that LyondellBasell Industries is showing 5 warning signs in our investment analysis and 1 of those is potentially serious...If you are no longer interested in LyondellBasell Industries, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Additionally, the bottom line advanced 1.8% year over year.ELV’s operating revenues improved 10.1% year over year to $39,667 million in the quarter under review. The top line missed the consensus mark by a whisker but came higher than our estimate of $37,919.9 million.The quarterly performance benefited on the back of growing premiums stemming from rate increases coupled with membership growth across its Medicaid and Medicare Advantage businesses. Additionally, higher consumers served and increased utilization of prescription drugs, paving way for improved pharmacy product revenues across ELV’s CarelonRx unit, contributed to the upside. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level.Elevance Health, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Elevance Health, Inc.

The total operating margin improved 10 bps year over year to 3.4% in the fourth quarter.Total expenses increased 10.2% year over year to $38,775 million due to increased benefit expenses, cost of products sold, and selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses. Our estimate indicated total expenses of $36,844.6 million for the fourth quarter.Story continuesThe SG&amp;A expense ratio was at 11.5%, which improved 20 bps year over year on the back of operating expense leverage linked with growing operating revenues.Segmental ResultsCommercial &amp; Specialty BusinessThe segment has reported operating revenues of $10,350 million, which advanced 4.5% year over year in the fourth quarter but fell short of our estimate of $10,759.6 million.Operating gain increased nearly four-fold year over year to $260 million, owing to better medical underwriting performance within its commercial risk-based business and reduced business optimization costs.

The improvement came on the back of Carelon’s improved affiliated and unaffiliated earnings.Segmental UpdateElevance Health will have four reportable segments in 2023 — Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services, and Corporate &amp; Other. The Health Benefits segment will be an amalgamation of ELV’s prevailing Commercial &amp; Specialty Business and Government Business.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on LKQ's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for LKQ How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LKQ is:22% = US$1.2b ÷ US$5.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.22 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.LKQ's Earnings Growth And 22% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that LKQ has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 24% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 21% net income growth seen by LKQ was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared LKQ's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 26% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LKQ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is LKQ Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?LKQ's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 16%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 84% of its profits. So it looks like LKQ is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.While LKQ has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 33% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with LKQ's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.02%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.03%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 5.44%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the beauty products company had gained 11.63% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 1.82% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.57% in that time.Estee Lauder will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 2, 2023. On that day, Estee Lauder is projected to report earnings of $1.29 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 57.14%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $4.57 billion, down 17.56% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.37 per share and revenue of $16.7 billion. These totals would mark changes of -25.83% and -5.83%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Estee Lauder should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.48% higher. Estee Lauder is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesDigging into valuation, Estee Lauder currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 51.6. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 32.96, which means Estee Lauder is trading at a premium to the group.Meanwhile, EL's PEG ratio is currently 5.36. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Cosmetics industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.94 as of yesterday's close.The Cosmetics industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 18, which puts it in the top 8% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

It is worth considering Estee Lauder (EL), which belongs to the Zacks Cosmetics industry.This beauty products company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 18.73%.For the last reported quarter, Estee Lauder came out with earnings of $1.37 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share, representing a surprise of 6.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.42 per share, delivering a surprise of 31.25%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Estee Lauder lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Estee Lauder has an Earnings ESP of +0.45% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 2, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Helen of Troy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HELE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than EL has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HELE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.92, while EL has a forward P/E of 51.60. We also note that HELE has a PEG ratio of 1.49. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EL currently has a PEG ratio of 5.36.Another notable valuation metric for HELE is its P/B ratio of 1.83. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, EL has a P/B of 17.92.Based on these metrics and many more, HELE holds a Value grade of B, while EL has a Value grade of F.Story continuesHELE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

ADM.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Q4 Earnings Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, BHP and AccentureThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily a real-time scorecard of the ongoing Q4 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., BHP Group Ltd. and Accenture plc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardIncluding all the reports that came out this morning, we now have Q4 results from 72 S&amp;P 500 or 14.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 72 index members are down -7.5% from the same period last year on +7.2% higher revenues, with 68.1% beating EPS estimates and 65.3% beating revenues estimates.Relative to historical periods, the Q4 beats percentages are on the low side, particularly for EPS beats.The 68.1% EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members compares to 72.2% in the preceding quarter (2022 Q3) and a 20-quarter average of 78.2%. Over the preceding 20-quarter period, the EPS beats percentage for this group of 72 index members has been as high as 88.9% (in 2021 Q2) and as low as 61.1% (2020 Q1).The beats pecentages on the revenue side are also on the lower side relative to the preceding 20-quarter period, but not as pronounced as with the EPS beats percentages.Story continuesThis trend of lower beats percentages could change as we go through the remainder of the Q4 reporting cycle. But if it persists, it would indicate that Q4 estimates hadn't fallen as much as was warranted by underlying business conditions.Since management teams are typically quite adept at anchoring such expectations, one could even argue that the shortfall likely took even management teams by surprise.We will see how this trend evolves over the remainder of this reporting cycle, but we are not seeing its direct follow through in estimates for the current period (2023 Q1).S&amp;P 500 earnings for 2023 Q1 are currently expected to be down -4.3% from the same period last year on +2.6% higher revenues. This is down from -4% on January 6th and -2.9% in mid-December 2022.For complete details about the Q4 earnings season and the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Good Enough Start to the Q4 Earnings SeasonToday's Featured Research ReportsShares of Berkshire Hathaway have gained +1.0% over the past year against the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's gain of +2.4%.

The stock has declined 7.9% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why PG Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 29.15 for PG is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PG in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, PG currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

519,70702538-a8e0-3357-809f-a39b36ebd71b,PG,2023-01-26,Wall Street Analysts Think P&G (PG) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-p-143002823.html,1674657002,STORY,['PG'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.P&amp;G currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 58.3% and 16.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PGBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PGCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for P&amp;G here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying P&amp;G, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PG?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for P&amp;G, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $5.84.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for P&amp;G may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

520,55c56962-45d4-38ec-8e3e-2c564f388644,PG,2023-01-26,Procter & Gamble Company The (PG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-pg-trending-140002755.html,1674655202,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has lost 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +0.5%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +7.4% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for P&amp;G.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.64 billion and $83.86 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.9%. EPS of $1.59 for the same period compares with $1.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.81%. The EPS surprise was +0.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure fell 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.52.The results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues and a fall in occupancy. However, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) improved year over year.SLG clocked in net rental revenues of $172.89 million in the fourth quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $173.06 million.

The reported figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $588.9 million.Concurrent with the earnings release, SL Green unveiled that it signed leases totaling 343,186 square feet in the early weeks of 2023. The company’s new leases include a 15-year lease with 777 Partners, an alternative investment platform encompassing 18,476 square feet at One Madison Avenue’s entire 27th floor.

This excludes the lease termination income.For its Manhattan portfolio, SL Green signed 33 office leases encompassing 196,421 square feet of space in the reported quarter. The mark-to-market on signed Manhattan office leases fell 4.7% from the previous fully-escalated rents on the same spaces for the quarter.The average lease term for the Manhattan office leases signed was eight years, while average tenant concessions were 7.4 months of free rent with a tenant improvement allowance of $59.58 per rentable square foot. This excludes the leases signed at One Vanderbilt Avenue.As of Dec 31, 2022, Manhattan’s same-store office occupancy, inclusive of 58,143 square feet of leases signed but not yet commenced, was 91.2%, decreasing 90 basis points from the prior quarter’s level.As of the same date, the carrying value of the company’s debt and preferred equity portfolio was $623.3 million.LiquiditySL Green exited fourth-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $203.3 million, up from $201.3 million recorded as of Sep 30, 2022.Investment ActivityIn December, SLG completed the earlier announced disposition of 414,317 square feet of office leasehold condominium units at 885 Third Avenue, popularly known as “The Lipstick Building”, to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for $300.4 million. Net cash proceeds generated from the transaction were $281 million. Further, SLG retained the remaining 218,796 square feet of the building.In the same month, the company entered into an agreement to sell the retail condominiums at 121 Greene Street, together with its joint venture partner, for $14 million.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this commercial real estate investment trust would post FFO of $1.64 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1.66, delivering a surprise of 1.22%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.SL Green , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $224.87 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 29.94%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $135.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.SL Green shares have added about 9.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.6%.What's Next for SL Green?While SL Green has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for SL Green: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $1.43 on $162.81 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.53 on $666.5 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Outfront Media (OUT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This billboard, transit and digital display advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.2%.

DISCLOSURESFunds from Operations (FFO)FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company’s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based bonuses for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including the Company's ability to make cash distributions.Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as FFO plus non-real estate depreciation, allowance for straight line credit loss, adjustment for straight line operating lease rent, non-cash deferred compensation, and pro-rata adjustments for these items from the Company's unconsolidated JVs, less straight line rental income, free rent net of amortization, second cycle tenant improvement and leasing costs, and recurring capital expenditures.FAD is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. FAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate FAD the same way, the presentation of FAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. FAD does not represent cash flow from operating, investing and finance activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre)EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in September 2017 defines EBITDAre as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus (minus) losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, plus adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated joint ventures.The Company presents EBITDAre because the Company believes that EBITDAre, along with cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities, provides investors with an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indication of the Company’s financial performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOINOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating income before transaction related costs, gains/losses on early extinguishment of debt, marketing general and administrative expenses and non-real estate revenue. Cash NOI is also a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated by subtracting free rent (net of amortization), straight-line rent, and the amortization of acquired above and below-market leases from NOI, while adding operating lease straight-line adjustment and the allowance for straight-line tenant credit loss.The Company presents NOI and Cash NOI because the Company believes that these measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and reconciliations, provide investors with meaningful information regarding the operating performance of properties. When operating performance is compared across multiple periods, the investor is provided with information not immediately apparent from net income that is determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI and Cash NOI provide information on trends in the revenue generated and expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties, unaffected by the cost of leverage, straight-line adjustments, depreciation, amortization, and other net income components. The Company uses these metrics internally as performance measures. None of these measures is an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) and same-store performance should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income performance.Coverage RatiosThe Company presents fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios to provide a measure of the Company’s financial flexibility to service current debt amortization, interest expense and operating lease rent from current cash net operating income. These coverage ratios represent a common measure of the Company’s ability to service fixed cash payments; however, these ratios are not used as an alternative to cash flow from operating, financing and investing activities (determined in accordance with GAAP).SLG-EARNPress Contactslgreen@berlinrosen.com]"

(NYSE:DHI) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript January 24, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. There will be an opportunity to ask questions on today's call.

Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.David Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid first quarter, highlighted by earnings of $2.76 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.3 billion, on a 3% increase in revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 39.5% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 31.5%. Beginning in June 2022 and continuing through today, we have seen a moderation in housing demand due to affordability challenges caused by the significant rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty.Story continuesDespite these pressures, we still closed over 17,000 homes and sold more than 13,000 homes in what is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. We have seen increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January. While higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and resale homes at a portable price points remains limited, and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate the current challenging market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great creative supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility.We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to meet market, optimize returns, consolidate market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike?Mike Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 13% to $2.76 per diluted share compared to $3.17 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 16% to $958.7 million, on a 3% increase in consolidated revenues to $7.3 billion. Our first quarter home sales were $6.7 billion, on 17,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $386,900, up 7% from the prior year quarter and down 4% sequentially. Paul?Paul Romanowski: During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our home buyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our cancellation rate for the first quarter was 27%, down from 32% sequentially, but still elevated from our typical. Our net sales orders in the first quarter decreased 38% to 13,382 homes, and our order value decreased 40% from the prior year to $4.9 million. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was down 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $367,900, down 4% from the prior year quarter.We are continuing to offer mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs and other incentives to drive traffic to our communities, and we are reducing home prices where necessary to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. Our second quarter sales volume will depend on the strength of its spring selling season, and we currently expect significantly higher levels of net sales orders in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter based on historical seasonal trends, current market conditions and our inventory of completed homes available for sale. Bill?Bill Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 23.9%, down 440 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 4% sequentially, stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 2% and lock costs were flat. The decrease in our gross margin from September to December was in line with our expectations and reflects the increased construction costs we incurred during 2022, along with higher sales incentives and home price reductions. We expect both our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease further in our second quarter for fiscal 2023. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making progress in these efforts, but we do not expect to see much benefit from lower costs on homes closed in fiscal 2023. Jessica?Jessica Hansen: In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&amp;A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. We are controlling our SG&amp;A during this market transition while ensuring our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?Paul Romanowski: We slightly increased our home starts from the last quarter to 13,900 homes and ended the quarter with 43,200 homes in inventory, down 21% from a year-ago and down 7% sequentially. 27,800 of our homes at December 31 were unsold, of which 7,100 were completed. We are focused on improving our housing inventory turnover. With more completed homes not available for sale, we expect our mix of homes sold and closed in the same quarter to increase back towards our normal historical levels. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time fully increased by a few days compared to fourth quarter, which reflects lingering supply chain issues. However, we are seeing some stabilization in cycle times on homes that we have recently started and we expect the cycle times to improve during fiscal 2023. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike?Photo by Brett Jordan on UnsplashMike Murray: Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 551,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding loss position decreased by 22,000 lots from September to December. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchased them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on future expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land, land and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our homebuilding segment incurred $4.8 million of inventory impairments and wrote off $19.4 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts.We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1.7 billion, down 21% from the prior year quarter and up 16% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $900 million for finished lots, $690 million for land development, and $130 million to acquire land. Bill?Bill Wheat: Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $18.2 million on $137 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit conversion of 13.3%. The lower profitability of our financial services business this quarter was primarily due to lower gains on sales and mortgages, increased competitive conditions, and a lower volume of interest rate lots by homebuyers during the December quarter. We expect our financial services to pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the first quarter, but lower than the full year of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter, 99% from mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed to buyer home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our homebuyers.FHA and VA loans are accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 7.2 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike?Mike Murray: Our rental operations generated $328 million of revenues during the first quarter from the sale of 694 single-family rental homes and 300 multi-family rental units, earning pre-tax income of $110 million. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $2.9 billion, which included approximately $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1 billion of multi-family rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the second quarter, we currently expect no multifamily rental sales and to close fewer single-family rental homes than in the first quarter. Paul?Paul Romanowski: Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $216.7 million on 2,263 lots sold and pre-tax income of $27.9 million for the first quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,300 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $190 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 28.7%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet the current challenging market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill?Bill Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operated platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders. During the first three months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $313.9 million, and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $829.1 million. At December 31st, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 12.8% at the end of December, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 22% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 13.3%. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $20.2 billion and book value per share was $58.71, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 31.5%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $86.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $118.1 million. Jessica?Jessica Hansen: As we look forward, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. We are providing detailed guidance for the second quarter as is our standard practice, but it is still too early to know what housing market conditions will be during the height of the spring selling season, so we are not providing specific guidance for the full year yet. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 20% to 21% and homebuilding SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 8% to 8.3%.We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 20%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24% in the second quarter. We are well positioned to aggregate market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations. Our goal remains to generate consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 or slightly higher than fiscal 2022. However, it is realistic to expect that our full year revenues will decline year-over-year, given the environment and pricing actions we are taking. The low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage, which is unchanged from last quarter. We forecast an income tax rate for the year of approximately 23.5% to 24%.We expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations and on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. We also plan to repurchase shares at a similar dollar amount as last year to reduce our share count during this year with the volume of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities. We have $700 million of senior notes that matured during the remainder of fiscal 2023, which we are currently preparing to repay from cash. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares.David?David Auld: In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in providing homeownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks.

Gains were held in check as some investors were disappointed with first-quarter outlooks, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said.JetBlue forecast expenses excluding fuel to rise 1.5% to 4.5% in 2023. Negotiations with pilots, along with other issues ""could result in some adjustments to (JetBlue's) 2023 outlook"", Citi analysts warned in a note.Alaska Air on Thursday warned that it would face pressures from higher labor costs and expenses related to pilot training as it phases out Airbus SE jets in favor of Boeing Co planes.Story continuesIn a sign that travel demand was losing some steam, credit card giant Mastercard Inc forecast current-quarter revenue growth short of Wall Street estimates on Thursday, saying the boost from pent-up demand for travel will diminish going forward.The U.S. economy, meanwhile, grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter but some analysts are warning that the pace of growth may slow as the impact from the U.S. central bank's interest rate hikes take hold.China's recent reopening may also boost international travel, but demand remains uncertain and U.S. airlines face challenges toward cashing in.""The airline industry will benefit as travel reopens, but we anticipate more outbound travel from China to the West than from the West to China as Chinese consumers take their turn at 'revenge travel,'"" Cowen's Becker said in a note.American Airlines forecast an adjusted profit of $2.50 to $3.50 per share for 2023, handily beating analyst expectations of $1.77, according to Refinitiv data.The resilient demand has allowed Fort Worth, Texas-based American to focus on fixing its debt-laden balance sheet. It has outlined a goal of paying down $15 billion of totaldebt by the end of 2025.Earlier this month, rival carriers United Airlines and Delta Air Lines reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and gave a bullish outlook amid recessionary fears.(Reporting by Aishwarya Nair and Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru.

Excluding net special items1, fourth-quarter and full-year net income of $827 million and $328 million, or $1.17 per diluted share and $0.50 per diluted share, respectively.Record fourth-quarter revenue of $13.2 billion, which represents a 16.6% increase over the same period in 2019, despite flying 6.1% less capacity.Ended the year with $12 billion of total available liquidity, after prepaying a $1.2 billion term loan during the fourth quarter.Company continues to execute on its plan to pay down $15 billion of total debt2 by the end of 2025.“The American Airlines team has produced outstanding results over the past year,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “We committed to running a reliable operation and returning to profitability, and our team is delivering on both. We’re proud to have led the industry in operational performance over the holidays while producing record full-year and fourth-quarter revenues, resulting in a third consecutive quarterly profit and a profit for the full year. As we turn our attention to 2023, we will continue to prioritize reliability, profitability and debt reduction.”Running a reliable operationAmerican and its regional partners operated more than 475,000 flights in the fourth quarter, with an average load factor of 83.9%. For the quarter, American ranked first in completion factor among the nine largest U.S. carriers.The American team delivered an even stronger performance over the holidays, despite challenging conditions in many parts of the country. American outperformed the industry over the December holiday period, ranking first in completion factor. The momentum has continued into 2023 as American has delivered the best on-time arrival performance of the nine largest U.S. carriers so far this year.Story continuesReturning to profitabilityAmerican produced revenues of $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16.6% versus the same period in 2019 and the highest fourth-quarter revenue in company history, driven by the continued strength of the demand environment. This record revenue was achieved while flying 6.1% less capacity than the same period in 2019. On both a GAAP basis and excluding the impact of net special items, the company produced an operating margin of 10.5% in the quarter. American also produced record revenues of $49 billion for the full year, resulting in full-year profitability.Liquidity and balance sheetIn the fourth quarter, American made approximately $539 million in debt and finance lease payments and prepaid a $1.2 billion term loan. The company ended the year with $12 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of cash and short-term investments plus undrawn capacity under revolving and other credit facilities. Total debt2 reduction continues to be a top priority, and the company is more than halfway to its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. As of Dec. 31, 2022, American had reduced its total debt by more than $8 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.Guidance and investor updateBased on demand trends and the current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be approximately breakeven. Based on today’s guidance, American expects its full-year 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $2.50 and $3.50.For additional financial forecasting detail, please refer to the company’s investor update, furnished with this press release with the SEC on Form 8-K.

(the Company) sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.The tables below present the reconciliations of the following GAAP measures to their non-GAAP measures:- Operating Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Operating Income (Loss) Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Operating Margin (GAAP measure) to Operating Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Pre-Tax Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Income (Loss) Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Pre-Tax Margin (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Net Income (Loss) (GAAP measure) to Net Income (Loss) Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)- Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (GAAP measure) to Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Excluding Net Special Items (non-GAAP measure)Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand the Company’s core operating performanceAdditionally, the tables below present the reconciliations of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure) and total operating costs per ASM (CASM) to CASM excluding net special items and fuel. Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel and CASM excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the Company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze the Company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance.                  3

Investors will remain busy sorting through quarterly results for some time, with plenty of companies unveiling what’s transpired behind closed doors.We’ve received quarterly results from several notable companies, including titans Netflix NFLX and Microsoft MSFT.And we’ve received results from several airliners, including Delta Air Lines DAL.Now, American Airlines AAL is gearing up to unveil its quarterly results tomorrow on Thursday, January 26th, before the market open.American Airlines, the largest airline internationally, provides passenger and cargo services. Currently, the company sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).How does the company currently shape up? We can use quarterly results received from DAL as a small gauge.Delta Air Lines Q4Delta Air Lines posted better-than-expected results thanks to a continued recovery in travel demand, reporting EPS of $1.48, which exceeded our consensus estimate by more than 14.7%.In addition, Delta generated roughly $13.4 billion in revenue throughout the period, more than enough to exceed the Zacks Consensus Sales estimate of $13 billion and reflecting a sizable 41% Y/Y increase. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDemand remained hot throughout the quarter, resulting in a 7% uptick in Domestic total passenger revenue compared to the December 2019 quarter. It’s worth noting that many airliners base their growth comps on pre-pandemic levels.Further, operating cash flow totaled $1.2 billion, and the company made $285 million in payments on debt and finance lease obligations throughout the period.Ed Bastian, CEO, on the results, “As we move into 2023, the industry backdrop for air travel remains favorable and Delta is well positioned to deliver significant earnings and free cash flow growth.  We expect to grow 2023 revenue by 15 to 20 percent and improve unit costs year-over-year, supporting a full-year outlook for earnings of $5 to $6 per share and keeping us on track to achieve more than $7 of earnings per share in 2024.”Story continuesDelta Air Lines shares are up nearly 20% YTD.American AirlinesQuarterly Estimates – Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s quarterly outlook, with six positive earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last several months.Look out – the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.84 suggests an uptick of nearly 160% Y/Y.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s top line also looks to bounce back, with our $12.9 billion quarterly revenue estimate suggesting an improvement of nearly 40% Y/Y. Clearly, the recovery is in full swing.Valuation – Presently, AAL shares trade at a 0.2X forward price-to-sales ratio, beneath the 0.3X five-year median and Zacks Transportation sector average of 1.6X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly Performance –American Airlines has primarily exceeded quarterly estimates, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in three of its last four releases. In its latest release, the airliner beat earnings expectations by more than 25%.Top-line results have also been positive, with AAL beating revenue estimates in six consecutive quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPutting Everything TogetherInvestors remain busy with earnings season, undoubtedly one of the most critical periods of the entire year for stocks.And tomorrow, we’ll receive quarterly results from American Airlines AAL. A peer, Delta Air Lines DAL, has already reported quarterly results, exceeding estimates handily.Analysts have been bullish for AAL’s quarter, with estimates suggesting a sizable recovery within earnings and revenue.Further, the company has consistently beat expectations as of late, and the company’s forward price-to-sales-ratio remains below the five-year median.Heading into the release, American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an Earnings ESP Score of 9.8%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

542,c9b4cb51-8f83-3c27-878f-98ea0c785910,AFL,2023-01-26,Aflac (AFL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-afl-expected-beat-earnings-150003991.html,1674658803,STORY,"['AFL', 'UNM']","[The market expects Aflac (AFL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.49 billion, down 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.85% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aflac?For Aflac, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Aflac will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aflac would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of +0.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aflac appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Unum (UNM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +64%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Unum has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.06%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Unum will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In Performance Coatings Group, sales increased in nearly all business units, and adjusted segment margin improved 250 basis points year-over-year.""FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTSThree Months Ended December 31,20222021$ Change% ChangeNet sales$      5,230.5$      4,762.1$         468.49.8 %Income before income taxes$         494.9$         308.9$         186.060.2 %As a % of sales9.5 %6.5 %Net income per share - diluted$           1.48$           1.15$           0.3328.7 %Adjusted net income per share - diluted$           1.89$           1.34$           0.5541.0 % Consolidated net sales increased primarily due to selling price increases in all segments and higher architectural sales volume in The Americas Group, partially offset by lower sales volumes outside of North America in the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings Groups. Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales by approximately 1.5%, while currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales by 2.0%.Income before income taxes increased primarily due to selling price increases in all segments and higher sales volume in The Americas Group. These factors were partially offset by higher raw material costs across all three segments, increased SG&amp;A spending in The Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group, costs associated with our previously announced targeted restructuring actions including non-cash trademark impairment charges and higher interest expense.Diluted net income per share included a charge of $0.21 per share for acquisition-related amortization expense and charges totaling $0.20 per share related to restructuring actions including non-cash trademark impairments.FOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTSThe Americas Group (""TAG"")Three Months Ended December 31,20222021$ Change % ChangeNet sales$      3,071.1$      2,653.5$         417.615.7 %Same-store sales (1)15.5 %1.0 %Segment profit$         526.7$         400.3$         126.431.6 %Reported segment margin17.2 %15.1 %(1) Same-store sales represents net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open more than twelve calendar months. Net sales in TAG increased due primarily to selling price increases and higher architectural sales volume in most end markets.

Currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 1.7%. CBG segment profit decreased primarily due to the lower sales volume, increased raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, and the costs associated with targeted restructuring actions including non-cash trademark impairments.

Acquisitions increased PCG's net sales by approximately 4.5% in the quarter, while currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 4.3%. PCG segment profit increased due primarily to selling price increases, partially offset by increased raw material costs and higher costs to support increased sales levels.

This strong cash generation, along with an increase in our short-term borrowings and long-term debt, allowed the Company to return cash of approximately $1.50 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and close five acquisitions during the year. The Company purchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock during the year. At December 31, 2022, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 45.2 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases.2023 GUIDANCEFirst QuarterFull Year20232023Net salesFlat to up mid-single digit %Down mid-single digit % to flatEffective tax rateLow twenty percentDiluted net income per share$6.79-$7.59Adjusted diluted net income per share (1)$7.95-$8.65(1) Excludes $0.81 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, and $0.25 to $0.35 per share of restructuring expense. ""We enter 2023 with confidence and energy. We have clarity of mission, the right strategy and a focus on solutions for our customers,"" said Mr. Morikis. ""Above all, we have the right people, and we expect to outperform the market in 2023 just as we have in the past.""At the same time, we will not be immune from what we expect to be a very challenging demand environment in 2023. Visibility beyond our first half of the year is limited. On the architectural side, U.S. housing will be under significant pressure this year. Slowing existing home sales and continued high inflation also will be headwinds. On the industrial side, we have already seen a slowdown in Europe, and the same is beginning to appear in the U.S. across several sectors. In China, COVID remains a factor and the trajectory of economic recovery is difficult to map. The U.S housing slowdown also will impact some of our industrial businesses, namely Industrial Wood and Coil. Our team is focused on winning new accounts and growing share of wallet in this challenging environment, while leveraging our exposure in more resilient end markets, including residential repaint, property maintenance, auto refinish, and packaging.""Against this backdrop, we expect 2023 first quarter consolidated net sales growth to be flat to up a mid-single digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, relying on indicators we see at this time, we expect consolidated net sales to be down a mid-single digit percentage to flat compared to 2022. With annual sales at this level, we are introducing diluted net income per share guidance in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share, including acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.81 per share and restructuring expense of $0.25 to $0.35 per share. Full year 2023 adjusted diluted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $7.95 to $8.65 per share compared to $8.73 per share in 2022.""We expect raw material costs to decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage, while other costs, including wages, are expected to increase by a mid-to-high single digit percentage. We will continue to execute the targeted restructuring actions we announced last quarter, while investing in growth initiatives and maintaining our balanced capital allocation strategy. The slide deck accompanying our press release provides other assumptions underlying our guidance. Should we see the year playing out differently than our current assumptions, we will adjust expectations and leverage opportunities to drive improved performance. I am highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles. We remain steadfast in our focus on creating shareholder value.""CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATIONThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, and its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, at 11:00 a.m. EST on Thursday, January 26, 2023.

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,341 million. The results were hurt by lower copper and gold prices. The company, however, witnessed higher copper and gold sales in the reported quarter. FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFreeportMcMoRan Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Quote Operational UpdateCopper production rose roughly 4% year over year to 1,070 million pounds in the reported quarter.Consolidated sales rose 2% year over year to 1,042 million pounds of copper. The company sold 458,000 ounces of gold (up around 16% year over year) and 19 million pounds of molybdenum (stable year over year) during the quarter. Gold sales rose primarily due to increased operating rates and recoveries at the Grasberg minerals district.Consolidated average unit net cash costs per pound of copper were $1.53, up around 19% year over year.

""Strikingly, that national championship run wasn't even her most memorable performance; she raced to the second-fastest girls high school 5K time in history with her 16:02.10 at the Nike Southeast Regional, eclipsing the 2019 WakeMed course record—previously held by three-time Gatorade National Player of the Year Katelyn Tuohy—by 20 seconds.""In addition to her finishes at the Nike Cross Nationals and Nike Southeast Regional, the 5-foot-8 senior also won the Group 3A individual state championship this season, which sparked the Mohigans to a state title as a team.

The theme of WEF this year was “cooperation in a fractured world.”Azevedo said the issue was of particular importance and interest to him. “Everywhere you go, everybody you talk to, climate change is part of the agenda,” he said. “For us, it’s critical. We’re a food company, so higher temperatures around the world means lower yields for the crops. Every one degree centigrade the Earth warms up, 10% of staple crops go out. It’s an urgent and important topic for survival of the business now.”The rapidly changing climate has long been on the minds of PepsiCo execs. “We are at a crossroads,” Indra Nooyi, former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, wrote in Fortune in 2020. “The time for platitudes and promises is over. We must create a better planet for future generations, and business must be at the vanguard.”Alongside its competitor, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo has been ranked as the world’s leading plastic polluter for four consecutive years. In September 2021, PepsiCo pledged to halve its use of virgin plastic across its portfolio by 2030. And, through a new initiative called PepsiCo Positive, it will incorporate half-recycled content in all its plastic packaging and scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging. The PepsiCo Foundation, for which Azevedo serves as chairman of the board, has thrown its weight behind reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“Addressing packaging waste is a global issue of paramount importance, and it will require systemic change,” Azevedo tells Fortune. Because there is no single way to achieve those ambitions, he added, the company is leaning on “a number” of strategies aimed at eliminating single-use plastics.Story continues“Ultimately, our vision is to help create a world where packaging never becomes waste,” Azevedo said. “It’s the right thing to do for the planet, and the smart thing to do for our business.”Climate takes the cakeClimate change was a hot topic at Davos this year. That might be because, a week prior to the conference, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report confirming that extreme weather caused over $165 billion in damage in 2022—a figure that likely stands to increase if nothing is done.Companies are facing increasing pressure to make operations more environmentally friendly and socially conscious, while dealing with critics who say ESG policies don’t prioritize business interests.The question of whether a recession will lead companies to walk back their ESG goals, or put them on hold, “has been the discussion all week,” George Oliver, CEO of Fortune 500 manufacturing company Johnson Controls, told Fortune CEO Alan Murray. “[Will an economic slowdown] change the commitment that CEOs have made to decarbonization? It hasn’t yet. I don’t even think it has changed the pace…I think there’s a recognition that time is critical, and there is a lot to get done.”John Holland-Kaye, CEO of London’s Heathrow Airport, proposed that high-net-worth people and companies should pay more for plane tickets to cover everyone’s costs of sustainable jet fuel.“We need to be paying the premium for sustainable aviation fuels so that we can get the cost of it down so that the mass market and developing countries don’t have to pay for the energy transition,” Holland-Kaye said. “The wealthy people in this room and wealthy nations should be funding the energy transition in aviation to help support developing countries.”Beyond the ever-present climate risk, numerous urgent issues were on Azevedo’s mind at Davos, he told Vanham: fiscal monetary policies, inflation, unemployment, supply-chain upsets, and political tensions in the U.S., China, and Russia, especially as they relate to oil and commodity prices.But climate change remains first and foremost, both for Azevedo and PepsiCo, as well as the majority of WEF attendees; this year, they arrived to an unseasonably temperate Davos. As Murray reported in his CEO Daily newsletter, “There wasn’t a CEO to be found in Davos who wasn’t fully embracing the business effort to try and reach net-zero [emissions] by 2050.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Olympic legend Usain Bolt lost $12 million in savings to a scam.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned -6.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 points to a change of +8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.26 indicates a change of +7.4% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues.

Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $26.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.2%. The $85.21 billion and $87.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.2% and +3.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the years, dividend companies with resilient business models have helped investors to weather inflationary periods smoothly. Considering the risks of recession and investors’ appetite for dividend stocks, companies are trying to maintain or raise their payouts. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, cash dividends within the S&amp;P 500 set a record payment in the fourth quarter of 2022, growing by 10.2% from the same period last year.

Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American diversified conglomerate that manufactures products related to medical, commercial, and industrial markets.

Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company in Q3.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.”11. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based home improvement company that sells tools and construction-related products to its consumers. In the third quarter of 2022, the company posted revenue of $38.8 billion, up 5.6% growth from the same period last year. It also reported a 4.3% year-over-year growth in comparable sales.

(NYSE:HD) sold earlier this year, after the shares declined sharply on big picture concerns about a softer housing market and lower consumer spending. We believe that HD is a very well-managed company, positioned to continue showing good profits even as the economy decelerates. The products it carries in inventory are in year-round demand from contractors and homeowners wanting to maintain and improve their homes. The company has historically been shareholder friendly, repurchasing shares and increasing the dividend, most recently by 15% earlier this year. On September 30, HD’s current dividend yield was 2.8%.”10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90Another best S&amp;P 500 dividend stock on our list is S&amp;P Global Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9.

As one of the ‘Big Four’ U.S. banks it enjoys scale driven cost advantages and economies of scale which provide meaningful competitive advantages and potential for strong returns in the largely commoditized banking industry. A survivor of the financial crisis, BAC has emerged with a solid capital base and stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

To skip our detailed analysis of the biotech sector, you can go directly to see 5 Cheap Biotech Stocks To Buy.The biotechnology sector has been on the rise over the past three decades. Several forecasts expect the sector to make significant headway through developing cures for various diseases.Some of the more famous names in the biotech space include companies like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). These companies have steadily been making a name for themselves by producing medical cures and vaccines. Consequently, biotech stocks began soaring last year. According to a Wall Street Journal article published in August 2022, the SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF, an equal-weighted fund of biotech stocks, was up by 41.4% in August from its low on May 11. Another fund, iShares Biotechnology ETF, also rose by 21.8% from its low on June 16. A comparison with the S&amp;P 500's performance between June and August shows that the broader benchmark index was only up by 16.9% over the same period. This representation of the biotech sector's outperformance in the market resulted in renewed optimism among investors eyeing the sector, leading to stronger support for biotech stocks on Wall Street.According to a Global Trends report published by the National Intelligence Council's Strategic Futures Group in April 2021, the global bio-economy accounted for about $5 trillion, or nearly 6% of global GDP at the time. The global bio-economy refers to all activity enabled by research and innovation in the life sciences and biotech. The report also mentioned that the global bio-economy could exceed $20 trillion by 2023, based on 10%-15% annual revenue growth trends in the sector. This growth in the biotech sector is expected to arise from a more multidisciplinary and data-intensive approach to the life sciences and biotech over the next two decades. By 2023, we are already beginning to observe an increased usage of biotech by medical professionals and medical diagnostics.  Personal Internet of Things (IoT) devices are also being used to collect higher volumes of health data to be used in predicting new diseases and treatment outcomes in the biotech space.

We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future.

The bottom line reflects a rise of 13% from the year-ago quarter. We had projected the same to be $6.20.Results were aided by lower expenses. However, the tough operating backdrop hurt the assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) balance. This, in turn, hampered top-line growth.After considering significant items, net income (GAAP basis) was $494 million or $4.43 per share, down from $701 million or $5.96 per share in the prior-year quarter.In 2022, adjusted operating earnings of $25.14 outpaced the consensus estimate of $24.54 and grew 11% year over year.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ameriprise: favorable.

This strong performance was a result of continued significant organic growth with flows into advisory and brokerage accounts. The strategy to expand Ameriprise Bank and Certificate Company drove 59 percent asset growth for these businesses. The advisor base continues to build with excellent advisor retention, strong recruiting and increased productivity.Net revenues increased 5 percent as client inflows, higher investment income from bank growth and rising interest rates more than offset lower fees related to market depreciation and lower client activity, consistent with industry trends.Adjusted operating expenses declined 5 percent to $1.6 billion compared to a year ago. Distribution expenses declined 10 percent primarily from lower markets. G&amp;A and other expenses were $408 million, reflecting investments for business growth, including the bank, as well as higher volume-related activity from client inflows. Prior year G&amp;A expenses included unusually low staffing levels and limited travel and entertainment expense. The company continues to manage expenses prudently.Wealth Management delivered robust organic growth. Clients and advisors remained engaged and focused on positioning portfolios to meet financial planning goals in the face of a challenging market environment.Total client net flows were strong at $12.4 billion, evenly split between flows into advisory and non-advisory accounts, a mix shift that was consistent with the current market environment.

Earnings from performance fees were $30 million higher in the prior year. Net pretax adjusted operating margin was 29 percent in the quarter.Adjusted operating expenses decreased 12 percent. G&amp;A and other expenses continue to be well managed, down 6 percent. Distribution expenses decreased 22 percent primarily from market depreciation and lower sales.Total AUM decreased 23 percent to $584 billion primarily from market depreciation. Investment performance remained strong in a volatile environment with 131 funds with 4- and 5-star Morningstar ratings.In the quarter, net outflows were $0.4 billion and included $1.7 billion of outflows related to legacy insurance partners. Institutional inflows continued to offset elevated retail outflows.Retail net outflows were $3.7 billion, which included reinvested dividends. In North America, there were outflows in equity and fixed income strategies, similar to industry trends. In EMEA, outflows persisted as investor sentiment remained weak from higher interest rates and geopolitical strain.Global institutional net inflows were $5.0 billion primarily from liability-driven investing mandates.Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions Segment Adjusted Operating ResultsQuarter Ended December 31,% Over/(Under)(in millions, unaudited)20222021Adjusted operating net revenues$816$815-Adjusted operating expenses5876327%Pretax adjusted operating earnings$229$18325%Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions continues to generate strong free cash flow with a differentiated risk profile. We took strategic actions in the quarter to reposition the investment portfolio to extend duration to capture benefits from higher interest rates, a portion of which was recognized in the quarter.Pretax adjusted operating earnings were $229 million, up 25 percent from last year, primarily due to higher investment income, lower amortization of deferred acquisition cost and lower sales levels.Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions sales continued to reflect muted overall industry sales levels as well as management actions to optimize our business mix. Protection sales decreased 30 percent to $68 million, primarily related to the market environment. The majority of sales remain in higher-margin accumulation VUL products.

Since she joined Cisco three years ago, Karen has been involved in co-ordinating Cisco teams in community activity for a local domestic violence shelter and for gathering and repurposing food supplies for the homeless. She recently joined the ONEx Communities Global Day2Give as a Local Leader as well as joining the AppD Cares ANZ Chapter.Volunteering began in my life with the local district netball club. Led by mother's tradition of giving back to the community, our whole family assisted with the running of netball in northern Sydney, spending long nights checking scoresheets and registrations. My mother was recognised as the first Life Member of Ku-ring-gai Netball Association for her untiring services.In my first job as a junior public relations consultant, I offered to create a logo and write and produce newsletters for the prestigious organisation, VOLUNTEERING AUSTRALIA. I notice that the logo still sits proudly on their masthead some 35 years later, as they lead the country's largest volunteering activities. This group opened my eyes to how vast the movement is in our country.Thereafter in my public relations career I made it a goal to encourage my international corporate clients to support volunteering. This extended from celebrity visits to hospitals, to providing my communication services pro bono to community groups.I am a fourth-generation family member of people from Denmark and Scotland who settled here in 1864. Australia is known as ""the sunburnt country…a land of droughts and flooding plains"" from a famous poem ""My Country"" written in 1906 by Dorothea Mackellar. Our heritage as a country is to pull together during crises.Over the last four years Australia has struggled with droughts, bushfires, and floods as well as the pandemic. Joining Cisco during these crises, I helped raise awareness to raise donations for misplaced families and collect books and supplies for flood and bushfire victims. I recall driving to a pickup point with boxes of urgently needed headache medication for the firefighters.Story continuesThe Cisco CX Centre in Sydney won a CX ""Best of We"" Award for travelling to a rural high school to teach the students about robotics and the role it can play in everyday farming during droughts, etc. in managing water sprinkling systems. I wrote the submission for the award, and it was an incredibly proud moment for them to win.During the pandemic, repurposing food supplies to reach those in need became an urgent focus. Cisco teams would collect left over bread supplies from supermarkets and deliver them to a central repackaging group at a local Catholic church before distributing them to families in need the next day. Everyone in our team, including directors and engineers, spent hours packing bread products into family packs.Most recently, the AppDynamics teams have gone to several locations to cook up meals for distribution to the homeless in Sydney, the majority being women.I personally find the teamwork one of the best rewards. Seeing the enthusiasm of my co-workers to join the volunteering group is a wonderful feeling to experience. I love seeing the senior members working side by side with us all, peeling potatoes or using a bread slicing machine. In our new hybrid working era, it is great to be with each other achieving such great goals.And then to stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues and see the results of the freshly cooked food is the icing on the cake. Towering stacks of meals. Bags of food going to those who most need it. Food that would have ended up in landfill had it not been saved by the inspiring work of the volunteering organisations in Australia. It gives me great satisfaction to see left over vegetables being made into tasty curries. My colleagues are teaching me a lot about their traditional dishes. I know that these experiences are also creating great bonds between us all.Our collaboration will continue with these well-organised Australian charities such as Our Big Kitchen at Bondi and Gift of Bread based in Tempe in Sydney. Dignity Giving Back specialises in packing support hampers for return-to-school or other groups needing basic supplies during difficult times.Mary's House Services provides relief for domestic violence victims on the northside. The pink-themed, Australia's Biggest Morning Tea raises money for Breast Cancer care and research. St Kilda Mums in Melbourne assists their local community by providing car seats and other support for new families. There are many groups that Cisco Australia teams have assisted that focus on mental health including Movember for Men's Mental Health, R U OK and Lifeline.During work-from-home Covid-19 lockdowns, we spent many hours online providing wildlife research on Zooniverse watching video footage from cameras to log animal movement such as elephants and gorillas. In addition, we helped identify buildings and roads from aerial maps of villages in India for an organisation called Missing Maps. This provides security for young people, especially girls walking home from school as well as for emergency assistance.The greatest reward for us at Cisco, is the satisfaction and teamwork derived from volunteering. We are forging bonds that draw us together so we can support those that are less fortunate. A great tip to encourage team members is to visually communicate by posting photos in Webex Team Spaces. Joining the many Cisco groups that are passionate about giving-back also helps network the message and increase participation. I am so grateful that Cisco encourages volunteering. Many of my friends make the comment that companies like mine are what the world needs.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736687/How-Cisco-Employees-in-Australia-Step-Up-To-Volunteer]"
