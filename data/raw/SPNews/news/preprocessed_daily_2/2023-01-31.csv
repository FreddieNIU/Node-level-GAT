They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab, and has been able to amass over $2.88 billion, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex-U.S. Small Co. Index (Net) before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Small Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the developed ex U.S. companies in the FTSE Global Total Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.39%.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.85%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Whitehaven Coal Ltd (WHC) accounts for about 0.26% of the fund's total assets, followed by Aker Bp Asa (AKRBP) and Andritz Ag (ANDR).The top 10 holdings account for about 1.11% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has gained about 6.85% so far this year and is down about -3.55% in the last one year (as of 01/31/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $26.94 and $36.99.The ETF has a beta of 0.91 and standard deviation of 23.13% for the trailing three-year period, making it a low risk choice in the space. With about 1799 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market.

In its 11th annual report of the Best Online Stock Brokers, Schwab ranked first in seven of the 18 performance categories: Customer Service, Investment Research, Timely Information on Market Shifts, Incentives/Discounts/Pricing, Up-to-the-Minute Data on Inflation &amp; Other Market Influences, Availability of Account Types, and Trade Ideas for a Down Market. Companies named to the list were selected based on objective data from more than 3,446 investors.""Investors today have a wide range of choices and high expectations when it comes to their financial partner,"" said Jonathan Craig, Managing Director, Head of Investor Services &amp; Marketing at Charles Schwab.

Schwab paid a licensing fee for use of this award and logos.Investor’s Business Daily 2023 Best Brokers MethodologyIBD again collaborated with its respected polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, to measure investor sentiment toward brokers' performance in a number of critical service areas. Since 2012, IBD has asked investors to rate their primary online broker based on the most important and desirable broker attributes. This year's study follows the two-phase methodology employed in previous years. Both phases use online surveys to collect data.Phase I, conducted between August and September 2022, examined a total of 29 different attributes to determine which features and services offered by online brokers are most important to investors. Based on these results, the attributes were narrowed to 18 and assigned weights to compute the Best Overall Experience Index for each broker. The attributes for the 2023 Best Online Brokers were (in order of customer importance): Trade Execution Speed/Price, Website Security, Equity Trading Platform, Site Performance, Customer Service, Investment Research, Research Tools, Mobile Trading Platforms/Apps, Portfolio Analysis &amp; Reports, Timely Information on Market Shifts, Coverage of Pre-market &amp; After-hours Trading, Incentives/Discounts/Pricing, Options Trading Platform, Trade Ideas, Educational Resources, Up-to-the-Minute Data on Inflation &amp; Other Market-influencing Statistics, Availability of Account Types and Trade Ideas for a Down Market.Moving into Phase II (September to November 2022), the study measured consumers' experience and satisfaction with their primary online broker based on these 18 specific attributes. To qualify for ranking on the Best Online Brokers list, a broker must have had at least 125 customers participate in Phase II. Seven brokers met this threshold: Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (a subsidiary of The Charles Schwab Corporation), E-Trade Financial (part of Morgan Stanley), Vanguard, Robinhood and Interactive Brokers.DisclosuresInvesting involves risk including loss of principal.About Charles SchwabAt Charles Schwab, we believe in the power of investing to help individuals create a better tomorrow.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

However, an active catastrophe level is likely to have weighed on their performance.Premiums are likely to have benefited from continued improved pricing, strong retention and exposure growth across business lines. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided in better pricing in the fourth quarter.The fourth quarter of 2022 bore the brunt of winter storm Elliot.  Karen Clark &amp; Company estimates industry losses from Elliot to be about $5.4 billion. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are likely to witness improved investment results. The last year saw seven rate hikes, with the fourth quarter witnessing two hikes by the Fed. A larger investment asset base and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income.Accelerated digitalization is expected to have saved costs, thus aiding margins. A solid capital position aided insurers in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand geographically and diversify their portfolio, apart from enhancing shareholders value via share buybacks and raising dividends.Let’s take a sneak peek into how the abovementioned insurers are poised prior to their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 31.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Chubb’s fourth-quarter premiums are expected to have benefited from strong premium retention, new business and renewal retention. The top line is likely to have benefited from improved premium revenues as well as higher investment income.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs US equity strategy chief David Kostin noted in the beginning of November that despite Q3 GDP exceeding expectations, the US economy still appears to be headed towards a recession. During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs. Some firms that are aggressively buying back shares according to Goldman Sachs include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Investors can also check out 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks and 10 Stocks with Biggest Buybacks. Our Methodology Goldman Sachs searched for stocks that have a net buyback yield of at least 5%, which means these companies have repurchased 5% or more of their shares outstanding in proportion to their market capitalization over the past year, and have increased their buyback rate during that period. Below is a list of 20 companies that increased buybacks by at least 5% in the previous 12 months as of November 2, along with net buyback yield for each and share price returns from November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023.

COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

But in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) share price is up 48% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 19% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Qorvo In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, Qorvo became profitable. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the Qorvo share price is up 3.8% in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 48% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 1.2% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Qorvo has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 7.7% in the twelve months, Qorvo shareholders did even worse, losing 19%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued.

CSX is engaged in the transportation of rail freight in the Southeast, East, and Midwest via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of the U.S. and Canada. CSX performed well during the quarter after the company beat market expectations on its third-quarter results. The beats were largely driven by strong pricing, which could be hitting record highs, and healthy commodity/coal volume driven by the current energy crisis.”13. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada. The company operates through Allstate Protection, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Run-off Property-Liability segments. On December 2, The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) announced that it aims to generate long-term adjusted net income ROE of 14% to 17%. It is one of the stocks that are actively repurchasing shares as per Goldman Sachs, with a net buyback yield of 11%. On January 19, BMO Capital analyst Michael Zaremski initiated coverage of The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) with a Market Perform rating and a $130 price target. While the analyst appreciates The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)’s pricing power, he believes the company will rebuild capital with lower buybacks. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 38 hedge funds were bullish on The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), compared to 37 funds in the earlier quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -2.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has gained 9.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +276.4%. This estimate has changed -9% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.73 indicates a change of -14% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $11.41 billion and $9.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.5% and -19.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

WST did reduce full-year guidance by $100 million to account for greater foreign currency headwinds ($75mm impact) and slowing COVID demand ($85mm impact). This implies a guidance raise of $60 million on the base business, which we view as important to driving long term appreciation.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off.

His operating expertise and industry relationships will be invaluable in his role, where he will work directly with Bill O'Neill, Bion's CEO, to build a team and strategy to commercialize Bion's technology and product line.Mr. Rupp spent 25 years with Cargill, the last ten as President of Cargill Beef. He oversaw Cargill's global beef business operations that did over $25 billion in annual sales in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Mr. Rupp also served five years as President of JBS Beef, where he led JBS's North American beef business that did approximately $20 billion in sales. In 2021, Mr. Rupp was inducted into the National Provisioners' Meat Packer Hall of Fame. He is a senior advisor at Sustainable Beef, LLC, a rancher-owned packing plant being developed in western Nebraska, that has attracted an equity investment by Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Bion recently announced an LOI with Olson Farms/TD Angus, a cattle breeding and feeder operation that is a founding member of Sustainable Beef, LLC.Mr. Rupp said, ""The livestock industry – beef in particular – is changing; it must become more sustainable. Today's consumer is well-informed, and they are increasingly health- and environment-conscious. Alternative products, including plant-based, that were billed as sustainable were initially successful but have failed to meet consumer tastes and concerns. Bion's technology and business model provides the industry with a better way to feed cattle and connect the consumer with the real beef they want: beef that will now be truly sustainable, independently verified, and consistent with their tastes. I look forward to helping make it a reality – for the producer, the consumer, and the planet.""Story continuesBill O'Neill said, ""As we build our team, I can't think of anyone better suited to bring an experienced industry voice to our Board and organization. His accomplishments in the industry speak for themselves. We were happy when he joined the Advisory Group. We are thrilled he has the confidence in Bion and our opportunity to join the Board.""_________________________________About Bion: Bion's patented third generation technology (Gen3Tech) was designed to largely mitigate the environmental impacts of large-scale livestock production, increase its resource efficiencies, and deliver a USDA-certified sustainable product to the consumer.

It focuses on adding affluent renters to its roster.The residential REIT has also been making concerted efforts to diversify its portfolio and expand its footprint in the suburban markets where these affluent renters prefer to live, work and play. EQR’s efforts to capture the renter demand in these markets are likely to pay off well in the upcoming period.Equity Residential’s expansion efforts and robust development pipeline seem encouraging for long-term growth.In September 2022, Equity Residential and Toll Brothers, through the Toll Brothers Apartment Living rental division, unveiled plans to develop three luxury rental communities comprising 1,053 units in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area.In third-quarter 2022, it began construction on Lyle, a 334-unit apartment property in Dallas, TX. It entered a joint venture on Remy, a 357-unit apartment property in Frisco, TX, the construction of which commenced in first-quarter 2022.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. This is likely to provide the company with a competitive edge over others.On the balance sheet front, the company had $2.3 billion in available liquidity as of Sep 30, 2022. Its limited near-term debt maturities and solid credit metrics poise it well to capitalize on growth opportunities.Nonetheless, the continuation of the flexible working environment has resulted in lower renter demand for costlier and urban/infill markets, raising concerns for Equity Residential’s properties that are concentrated in the urban markets.Also, elevated supply in some of Equity Residentials’ markets like Denver, Dallas Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta could subdue demand for its properties, affecting profitability.Rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Analysts, too, seem bearish on the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

The consensus mark for the company’s earnings per share is pinned at $2.10, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 1.4%. The estimate has moved down 8% in the past 60 days.Q3 PerformanceAvery Dennison’s revenues and earnings improved year over year in third-quarter 2022. However, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.4%, on average.Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseAvery Dennison Corporation price-eps-surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAvery Dennison has been witnessing solid demand for the labeling of non-durable consumer goods like food, beverage, home and personal care products. This is likely to get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter sales, as around 40% of its revenues come from these products.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Label and Graphic Materials segment’s fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $1,374 million, calling for a 3.2% year-over-year increase. Strong demand for consumer-packaged goods and ongoing e-commerce trends are likely to have aided the business in the quarter. Volume improvement, focus on high-value categories, led by specialty labels, and contributions from productivity and pricing initiatives are anticipated to have buoyed the segment’s results in the quarter under review.However, these tailwinds are likely to have been slightly impacted by soft automotive end markets and supply-chain challenges. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s adjusted operating income is pegged at $169 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 2.4%.The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment’s sales in the fourth quarter are likely to have been aided by consistent strength in Radio-frequency identification, strong growth in the Intelligent Labels business and high-value categories, as well as robust growth in external embellishments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s October-December quarter’s sales is pegged at $631 million, indicating a decline of 4.2% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure of $659 million.Story continuesThe downside is likely to have been driven by a decline in demand for graphics and products serving durable and industrial end markets. Also, base apparel business volume is expected to have been impacted by inventory reduction efforts by some brands and retailers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s operating income is pegged at $78 million, indicating a decline of 12.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $89 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment’s sales is pegged at $186 million, down 3.6% from the prior-year quarter's reported level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's adjusted operating income is pinned at $18.18 million, up 1% from the 2021 reported figure.Avery Dennison has been executing several pricing and re-engineering actions to mitigate inflationary cost pressure. It has also announced additional price increases in most of its businesses worldwide. These are likely to have supported the company’s margins in the quarter under discussion. Supply-chain-related challenges, unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation, and rising raw material, labor and freight costs are expected to have offset these benefits in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Avery Dennison this time around.

The Joint Committee on Semiconductors is the focal point in an effort to position the state for big investment as the federal government puts $50 billion from the CHIPS Act toward domestic chip manufacturing and R&amp;D. There’s urgency to the committee’s work — the U.S. Commerce Department said it will issue application guidance early next month and begin making grants and loans on a rolling basis “as soon as applications can be responsibly processed, evaluated and negotiated.” In less than two weeks of activity, the committee has heard that the fiscal impact of a single fab could be in the billions, but also that the state will likely need to come up with upfront money as a lure while also wresting big swaths of land from rural reserves.Continue reading]"

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis semiconductor components maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.08 billion, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that ON Semiconductor Corp. Would post earnings of $1.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of +10.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

MET is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET’s fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.76, which indicates a decline of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number and is lower than our estimate of $1.77.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $16,952 million, suggesting a 16.1% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Earnings Surprise HistoryMetLife boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.00%. This is depicted in the chart below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, the revenues of MetLife are likely to have suffered due to declining premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums is pegged at $10,841 million, which indicates a 17.2% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure and is lower than our estimate of $10,976.8 million.Reduced variable investment income leading to declining net investment income coupled with lower universal life and investment-type product policy fees might have dampened MET’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus mark for net investment income and universal life and investment-type product policy fees stands at $4,308 million and $1,236 million, indicating a decline of 17.7% and 13.1%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimates for the metrics came higher than our estimates of $3,704.4 million and $1,088.3 million, respectively.Meanwhile, the softer performance of the Asia segment is expected to have dampened the quarterly performance of MetLife. The unit might have suffered a blow due to lower variable investment income and feeble underwriting results in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings of MET’s Asia business is pegged at $364 million, suggesting a 37.9% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Story continuesNevertheless, the downside to the quarterly results is likely to have been partly offset by strong performances of the U.S., Latin America and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segments. Solid volumes coupled with a significant decline in COVID life insurance claims might have contributed to the sound performance of the U.S. business in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for the segments’ adjusted earnings stands at $742 million, which indicates an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Both the Latin America segment and the EMEA segment are expected to have benefited on the back of robust sales in the fourth quarter. The consensus mark for adjusted earnings of the segments stand at $160 million and $60 million, hinting toward advancements of 28% and 42.9%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.However, an escalating expense level due to rising policyholder benefits and claims might have strained the margins of MetLife in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MetLife this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: MetLife has an Earnings ESP of -1.50% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.74 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76. You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MET carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for MetLife, here are some companies from the insurance space which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time:American International Group, Inc. AIG has an Earnings ESP of +5.73% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $1.19 per shar, suggesting a fall of 24.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The bottom line of American International beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 13.01%.Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE has an Earnings ESP of +5.61% and a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RE’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings stands at $9.29 per share, which highlights a rise of 1.9% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure.Everest Re’s earnings beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 10.26%.The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank of 3, currently.

They totaled 1.43 billion in 2021.That was close to the 2009 shipments level when Blackberry and Nokia phones were the market leaders as Apple tried to dent their dominance. The mobile phone market peaked in 2015 when shipments touched 1.9 billion units.The pandemic led to a fundamental change where people working from home didn't feel the need to change phones frequently, Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said in an interview.""Consumers are holding onto their phones longer than expected, from six to nine months, and moving away from fixed to flexible contracts in the absence of meaningful new technology,"" he said.The demand for smartphones and PCs initially rose during the pandemic, but started to weaken in the middle of the last year.Rising global interest rates and cost of living have dampened demand for smartphones, hitting companies ranging from Samsung to Apple.Personal computer shipments are expected to slide 6.8% this year after falling 16% in 2022, the research firm said. Lenovo, HP Inc and Dell are the top three PC makers.The slump in the devices market will slow in 2023 on expectations of a less pessimistic economic outlook through the year and eventual rise in consumer and business spending, Gartner said.(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; editing by Deepa Babington)]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Block (SQ) earns a Zacks Rank #3 24 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 23, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.32 a share.Block's Earnings ESP sits at 8.61%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.32 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29.SQ is one of just a large database of Business Services stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Gartner (IT).Gartner is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 7, 2023. IT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.58 a share eight days from its next earnings release.Gartner's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.52% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57.Story continuesSQ and IT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The state last week had planned to issue the expanded order by the end of January, but has faced resistance from miners.The department did not say how many tonnes of coal will be required.Whitehaven Coal Chief Executive Paul Flynn has said the government appeared to be looking to secure around 3 million to 5 million tonnes, but the company was pressing the state to explain how that shortfall estimate had been determined.Directions issued in December required a dozen coal mines that supply power plants in New South Wales to fill a shortfall in supply at a capped price of A$125 a tonne - well below the export price currently at about $265 a tonne - under a deal with the federal government.The mines are mainly owned by Glencore Plc, Peabody Energy, New Hope Corp and Thailand's Banpu PCL .The state now wants to spread the requirement to all the state's coal producers, including those that export all of their output, including BHP Group, Whitehaven Coal and Yancoal Australia.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.

Increased generation from wind and solar, plus an overall drop in EU power use amid mild weather and as consumers struggled with high prices, prevented a bigger coal rebound, it said.""There would need to be another (energy) crisis (in 2023) to reach higher coal generation than in 2022,"" Ember's head of data insights Dave Jones said.EU solar generation increased by a record 24%, or 39 TWh, last year - helping to fill a supply gap exacerbated by French nuclear plants being idled for maintenance, and a climate change-fuelled drought that cut hydropower output.The EU has said any uptick in coal use will be short-lived, and that countries should largely replace Russian gas using green energy and energy savings.Countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, are also expanding infrastructure to import more non-Russian gas, raising concerns among climate activists that this could lock in decades of fossil fuel demand.Story continuesAs part of plans to speed up Europe's shift to clean energy, EU countries and lawmakers are negotiating a more ambitious renewable energy target for 2030, covering sectors including transport and industry, as well as electricity.The EU Parliament and countries including Germany, Denmark and Spain, want a 45% renewables goal, while Hungary and Romania are among those seeking a lower 40%. The EU got 22% of its overall energy from renewables in 2021, the latest Eurostat data show.""Top down policies are almost lagging behind what you are seeing on the ground (with solar generation), with citizens and businesses going out and doing it themselves,"" Jones added.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Investors began to pile into value stocks in 2022 as financial markets wavered amid rising inflation, the Fed’s policy tightening and an uncertain geopolitical situation. The broader market's rotation towards value stocks is expected to continue this year as well, believe experts at Goldman Sachs, according to a Bloomberg report published earlier in January.  A Goldman Sachs team led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a note that value stocks will gain more traction in 2023 as tech stocks continue to feel margin pressure.The euphoric rise of technology stocks after the pandemic gave way to speculative buying. Investors were willing to pay a premium for loss-making tech companies whose profits lie far into the future. But as the market began to correct itself, investors grew more wary about tech stocks and were unable to develop a stomach for huge risks. The Bloomberg report also quoted several experts who think value stocks will be preferred over tech plays in the months to come. For example, Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian said, according to the report, that investors should “avoid crowded parts of the stock market, including big tech.”Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson also reportedly warned that profit margins at tech companies are likely to take a hit this year.Investors are now preferring value stocks with strong fundamentals and profitable businesses. Many of the popular value stocks also pay dividends. As you will see in this article, financial, energy and healthcare dominate this space. On the other hand, value investors are continuing to avoid tech stocks that are loss-making and don’t have strong growth prospects in the short term. However, major tech stocks, like Meta Platforms, are on the radar of value investors since tech companies of this scale are offering attractive entry points for investors, according to some analysts. More on that later in the article. First, let’s see our methodology for this article.Story continuesOur  MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the top holdings of Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) and picked stocks that have PE ratios of less than 18 as of January 26. The result was a long list of stocks. We then picked 15 of these stocks that have the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of the end of the third quarter. For that we used Insider Monkey’s premium database of 920 hedge funds. That means the stocks mentioned in this article are some of the most popular undervalued value stocks among elite hedge funds.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 493M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. A total of 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) at the end of the September quarter.14. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ranks 14th in our list of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has upped its dividends consistently for over a decade now. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)’s dividend yield as of January 26 stands at over 3% while its PE ratio is 15.68. Earlier in January, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.775 per share, in line with previous. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.38%.As of the end of the third quarter, 52 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), compared to 58 funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes was $3.3 billion.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)13. EOG Resources, Inc.

(NYSE: FE), is upgrading its distribution system in Allegheny and Washington counties to help prevent lengthy service interruptions, particularly during severe weather. The work includes installation of automated equipment along neighborhood power lines serving nearly 6,400 customers in South Park, Bethel Park, Peters Township and nearby areas.West Penn Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Expected to be completed in early 2023, the project is part of West Penn Power's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $147 million initiative to accelerate capital investments to the company's electric distribution system over five years to help ensure continued electric service reliability for customers.""West Penn Power continues to invest in new technologies and equipment to provide safe, dependable electric service for our customers,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""This project features automated equipment that will allow us to quickly reconfigure our network when a power line is out of service, temporarily switching customers to a nearby power line to keep their lights on while our utility crews make repairs. This is particularly important in this area, where trees outside of our permitted trimming areas frequently contact our electrical lines, causing power outages."" Hundreds of homes and businesses in the area will benefit from the installation of eight new automated reclosing devices along three neighborhood power lines to help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions. When an outage occurs, the reclosers will allow customers served by a power line extending from a substation near South Park Elementary School through a heavily wooded area along Stoltz Road to be temporarily transferred to two nearby lines from a substation off Sugar Camp Road near Peterswood Park. Customers served by those two power lines would benefit similarly when trouble occurs on either of those lines. Story continuesElectrical reclosing devices work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs. These devices can be controlled remotely by distribution system operators to quickly re-energize lines for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers. The devices have smart capability that will allow them to sense conditions on the system and operate automatically as more automated equipment is installed on the local network in coming years.This technology is safer and more efficient because it often allows utility personnel to restore service to customers remotely rather than sending a crew to investigate. If the device senses a more serious issue, such as a fallen tree on electrical equipment, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers by temporarily switching them to a different line. The devices can quickly pinpoint the location of the fault to help crews speed restoration.Crews will also install voltage regulators at key locations on the lines so that adequate voltage is maintained whenever the network is temporarily reconfigured during repairs. Crews have already replaced several utility poles to accommodate the new equipment.West Penn Power serves approximately 725,000 customers in 24 counties within central and southwestern Pennsylvania.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Utility Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Investors flocked to utility stocks in 2022 in search of some semblance of safety. Utility stocks are considered defensive investments as utility companies feel little or no effect of broader economic downturns since they continue to collect money from customers in exchange of essential services like electricity, heating and water. The S&amp;P 500 utilities sector was up more than 8% year to date in 2022 through September. However, during the last months of the year, utility stocks were hammed amid rising bond yields, which beat dividend yields offered by major utility companies.Still, utility stocks are some of the safest investment options for investors. The biggest factor that makes utilities stocks attractive is dividends. As you will see in this article, many utility companies offer steady and regular dividends to shareholders. Some of these stocks in sector have raised their dividend payouts consistently for the last several years.In a report published in December 2022, Fidelity said that the outlook for the utilities sector remains strong for 2023. The firm also believes the long-term outlook for the industry is bullish. Fidelity believes the world is moving from “petro-state” to “electro-state.” This shift, Fidelity believes, would bode well for the sector. The report also said that the Inflation Reduction Act would benefit the industry as the US government will give subsidies to lower the costs of renewable energy. Major companies are now moving away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. All of this, according to Fidelity, would hasten the shift from “petro-economy” to “electro-economy.”Pixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds and picked the top 10 utility stocks with PE ratios of less than 20.

However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

What's Wall Street looking out for? Among other things, the impact of inflation on the numbers like the cost of commodities and labor. Also of interest: Store growth and evidence that consumers are cheerier.The good news is that labor costs and retention rates among employees are gradually improving allowing companies to return to ""an increased focus on retention &amp; training,” Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse said in a note to investors.Meanwhile, here’s what analysts expect from earnings announcements from five of the biggest food chains:McDonald's (MCD) is expected to be one of the first to report earnings on Tuesday, January 31, before the market open. Per Bloomberg consensus estimates, the fast food giant is expected to report the following Q4 2022 results:Revenue: $5.74 billion, down 4.6% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $2.44, up 6.3% year-over-yearU.S. same-store sales: up 7.62%International operated markets same-store sales: up 7.56%Wall Street's take: That revenue is compared to $5.87 billion, when growth was down 5.3% in Q3; that came in higher than Wall Street estimates of $5.70 billion, boosted by higher menu prices.CITI analyst Jon Tower said the firm expects “a generally positive update” from the company with strong trends here in the U.S., easing foreign exchange headwinds, and improvement in its foreign exposure, specifically “that the European business has already seen the worst of inflation’s impact on the top &amp; bottom-lines.” Tower’s price target is $279.00 and has a Neutral rating.Starbucks (SBUX) will unveil its next quarterly results, first-quarter fiscal year 2023, on February 2. Analysts expect a boost in revenue:Revenue: $8.74 billion, up 8.6% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $0.77 per share, up 2.7% year-over-yearU.S. Same Store Sales: up 9.13%International Sales: down 3.87%China Sales: down 13.31%Story continuesWall Street's take: Last quarter, revenue jumped just 3.3%. Credit Suisse's Silberman said the firm still views SBUX as “one of the highest quality growth companies in restaurants,” with accelerating “same-store sales and unit growth, and margin expansion to support 15-20% EPS growth.”(FILE) SHANGHAI, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 20, 2021 - A Starbucks cafe is seen in Shanghai, China, September 20, 2021. January 8, 2023 - Shanghai has become the first city in the world to have more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops, according to data on the number of Starbucks coffee shops in every city in China. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)That makes Starbucks an “an attractive risk/reward” stock. Silberman also expects the removal of the zero-COVID 19 policy in China to boost sales.The U.S. is the elephant in the room: Analysts are also expecting to hear more from the company about the changes to its reward program, which has gotten some poor reviews from fans. Those are set to take effect in the next fiscal quarter on February 13. Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating on shares and a price target of $116.00.Starbucks reported its fourth-quarter 2022 fiscal year 2022 results back in November.Yum! Brands (YUM), which operates KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Habit Burger Grill, is expected to report February 8; analysts expect a big jump in earnings per share:Revenue: $1.9 billion, up 1.7% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $1.26 per share, up 23.3% year-over-yearSame-Store Sales: up 4.40%KFC: up 4.84%Pizza Hut: 1.70%Taco Bell: 6.30%Habit Burger Grill unit: 0.86%Wall Street's take: On Dec. 13, the fast food company hosted an Investor Day. Executives outlined system-sales growth of 10% for its Q4 2022, driven by strength in the Taco Bell U.S. business.Andrew Charles of Cowen, who has a price target of $155.00 and Outperform rating, said there was major ""upside"" to Taco Bell's same-store sales, which makes up roughly 30% of the company's operating profits. Charles added that opportunities for upside include how the brand balances value and premium menu innovation, and ""to a lesser degree"" how the company benefits from late-night sales (8 p.m.- close). That's ""where the brand is having an easier time staffing versus peers,"" he said. Digital is a focus, accounting for $24 billion in sales as of Q3 2022, with a 40% digital sales mix.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to report on February 7. For its fiscal fourth-quarter results, analysts expect:Revenue: $2.23 billion, up 13.9% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $8.92 per share, up 63.1% year-over-yearSame-store sales: 7.06%Wall Street's take: Last quarter, Chipotle brought in revenue of $2.23 billion, up 13.9% year-over-year. CITI, however, believes this quarter's expectations are “muted,” given ""company guidance around negative traffic and we understand the simple bear narrative (macro/too much price = persistent traffic issue).” In particular, Chipotle was directly impacted by the rising cost of avocados. To offset higher costs of food and labor, Chipotle raised menu prices 4% in August. That was the third time in 15 months. CITI has a Buy rating and $1,986 price target.A meal is seen in a Chipotle outlet in this photo illustration in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 7, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThis comes as Chipotle has big plans for the new year. Ahead of its busy season (March to May), it plans to hire 15,000 workers. This will help with the ultimate long-term goal to reach 7,000 locations in North America, with plans to open as many as 285 new restaurants in 2023, per Q3 results. BTIG Managing Director Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance when it comes to growth plans, ""they've been consistently stepping it up every year.""Shake Shack (SHAK) is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter results on February 16th after market close.Revenue: $238.4 million, up 17.3% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: -$0.11, down 11.1% year-over-yearSame-Store sales: 5.23%Wall Street's take: Shake Shack gave investors a preliminary look at its fourth-quarter results and its 2023 outlook at the ICR conference, a three-day event run by ICR partners. The burger chain announced plans to open 65 to 70 domestic and international locations in 2023, 40 of which will be company operated and nearly 30 owned by franchisers. One key development in the works: more drive thru locations, which tend to boost sales.Goldman Sachs was encouraged by the preliminary results. The firm wrote in a note, ""We are excited by SHAK’s diversification of store formats and think this will be key in driving unit growth for the company."" The firm has a Buy rating and $56 price target.Peter Saleh of BTIG, who moderated the interview at the conference, maintained a Buy rating and $60 price target following the preliminary results.In a note to investors, he said: ""While management did not get into detailed discussion on commodities or labor, it does appear as if the company is seeing promise in these areas, similar to the rest of the industry. While guidance for 1Q23 and the full year is lower than anticipated, we believe that could prove conservative as margin pressures ease while pricing remains elevated.""Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is expected to announce fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15. Analysts expect the followingRevenue: $901.87 million, up 16.1% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $0.58, up 18.9% year-over-yearSame-Store Sales: Cheesecake Factory: 4.94%North Italia: 9.60%Wall Street's take: Year-to-date shares are up more than 20%, despite two downgrades from analysts. UBS downgraded shares of from Neutral to Sell. UBS Analyst Dennis Geiger expects store sales to slow down for the fast-casual chain and for higher food and labor costs to take a toll on the company's bottom line. Whereas CITI downgraded the stock from a Buy to Neutral.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Starbucks (SBUX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.78 a share, just three days from its upcoming earnings release on February 2, 2023.Starbucks' Earnings ESP sits at 1.63%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.78 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.77.SBUX is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Booking Holdings (BKNG) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Booking Holdings, which is readying to report earnings on February 22, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $20.76 a share, and BKNG is 23 days out from its next earnings report.Booking Holdings' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.83% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.59.Story continuesSBUX and BKNG's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings beat of 11%.Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents per share, indicating growth of 6.9% year over year. In the past seven days, earnings estimates for the current quarter have remained stable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8.8 billion, suggesting growth of 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to NoteRobust comps growth, expansion efforts and solid North America sales are likely to have aided the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has also been benefiting from growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales.We expect North America sales and Channel Development sales to be $6,276.6 million and $468.4 million, up 9.5% and 12.3% year over year, respectively. The company is gaining from increase in transactions and average ticket growth.However, a decline in international sales is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s performance. We expect international sales to be $1,859.3 million, down 0.9% year over year. The dismal performance in China is likely to have adversely impacted the company’s international sales.Inflationary pressures and increased investments in store partner wages and benefits are likely to have affected the margin in the quarter-to-be reported. We expect the adjusted operating margin in first-quarter fiscal 2023 to be 14.5% compared with 15.1% reported in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, we expect total operating expenses to be $4,747.9 million, up 8.3% from the prior-year quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseStarbucks Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseStarbucks Corporation price-eps-surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Starbucks this time around.

79,6076f0fb-42b6-3419-b94e-2196b6aaf9df,PH,2023-01-31,Will Parker-Hannifin (PH) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parker-hannifin-ph-beat-estimates-171005612.html,1675098605,STORY,['PH'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Parker-Hannifin (PH). This company, which is in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this maker of motion and control products has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 12.35%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Parker-Hannifin was expected to post earnings of $4.15 per share, but it reported $4.74 per share instead, representing a surprise of 14.22%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.67 per share, while it actually produced $5.16 per share, a surprise of 10.49%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Parker-Hannifin lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Parker-Hannifin currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 2, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consolidated Subsidiaries  Non-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)  Impact of Certain Items Our discussion of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow and EBITDA, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of: (1) restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (a) restructuring charges, (b) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (c) facility closure and severance charges; (2) acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and (3) the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance related to COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory and a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by debt extinguishment costs and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions. The results of our foreign operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our total Sysco and our International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its International Foodservice Operations results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis. Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)Impact of Certain Items(Dollars in Thousands, Except for Share and Per Share Data)  13-Week Period Ended Dec. 31, 2022   13-Week Period Ended Jan. 1, 2022   Change in Dollars  % Change Sales (GAAP)$18,593,953  $16,320,203  $2,273,750  13.9%Impact of currency fluctuations (1) 332,426   —   332,426  2.1 Comparable sales using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)$18,926,379  $16,320,203  $2,606,176  16.0%               Cost of sales (GAAP)$15,244,337  $13,429,053  $1,815,284  13.5%               Gross profit (GAAP)$3,349,616  $2,891,150  $458,466  15.9%Impact of currency fluctuations (1) 67,898   —   67,898  2.3 Comparable gross profit adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)$3,417,514  $2,891,150  $526,364  18.2%               Gross margin (GAAP) 18.01%  17.72%     29 bpsImpact of currency fluctuations (1) 0.05   —      5 bpsComparable gross margin adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP) 18.06%  17.72%     34 bps               Operating expenses (GAAP)$2,708,974  $2,446,241  $262,733  10.7%Impact of restructuring and transformational project costs (2) (14,388)  (23,469)  9,081  38.7 Impact of acquisition-related costs (3) (28,960)  (33,732)  4,772  14.1 Impact of bad debt reserve adjustments (4) 1,923   6,438   (4,515) (70.1)Operating expenses adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP) 2,667,549   2,395,478   272,071  11.4 Impact of currency fluctuations (1) 66,976   —   66,976  2.8 Comparable operating expenses adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)$2,734,525  $2,395,478  $339,047  14.2%               Operating expense as a percentage of sales (GAAP) 14.57%  14.99%     -42 bpsImpact of certain item adjustments (0.22)  (0.31)     9 bpsAdjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales (Non-GAAP) 14.35%  14.68%     -33 bps               Operating income (GAAP)$640,642  $444,909  $195,733  44.0%Impact of restructuring and transformational project costs (2) 14,388   23,469   (9,081) (38.7)Impact of acquisition-related costs (3) 28,960   33,732   (4,772) (14.1)Impact of bad debt reserve adjustments (4) (1,923)  (6,438)  4,515  70.1 Operating income adjusted for Certain Items (Non-GAAP) 682,067   495,672   186,395  37.6 Impact of currency fluctuations (1) 922   —   922  0.2 Comparable operating income adjusted for Certain Items using a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP)$682,989  ]"

Defensive stocks are favored by investors during tough economic times as companies operating in the space feel little impact of the broader economic downturn. That’s because they sell products and services whose demand remains almost unchanged due to their essential nature. Defensive sectors include consumers staples, healthcare and utilities, among others. As of December 29, the S&amp;P 500 utility stocks as a whole fell 0.5% in 2022, while consumer staples were down 2.7% in the period. Compare this performance to the broader market (SPY) decline of about 20% and you begin to understand why everyone wants to invest in undervalued defensive stocks when things go south.Smart investors are continuing to prefer defensive stocks in 2023 as the economic outlook for this year paints no rosy picture. According a Wall Street Journal report, Lisa Erickson, head of the public markets group at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, believes the starting months of this year would continue to pose challenges. That’s why the investor reportedly said she is recommending dividend-paying defensive stocks to her clients.“We’ve had a perfect setup for defensive companies… With that type of volatility expected again, companies that can provide more of a cash-flow buffer in their returns look attractive,” Erickson reportedly said.Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 20 in the following three defensive sectors: consumer staples, healthcare and utilities. From the resultant dataset, we chose 15 stocks that had the most number of hedge funds invested in them.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -17.3%. This estimate has changed +2.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.74 indicates a change of -11.5% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $24.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.8%. The $99.3 billion and $96.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.5% and -2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $26.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.22 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was +17.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even though robust air-travel demand boosted the top lines of these airline operators, high-fuel costs limited bottom-line growth.Fourth-quarter earnings-related updates were discussed in the previous write-up as well.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 American Airlines’ fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.17 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 despite higher costs. In the year-ago quarter, AAL had incurred a loss of $1.42 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the present scenario. The fourth quarter of 2022 was the third consecutive profitable quarter, excluding net special items, at AAL since the onset of the pandemic. Operating revenues of $13,189 million increased 39.9% year over year, reflecting upbeat air-travel demand. Driven by the soaring demand for healthy bookings, management expects first-quarter 2023 total unit revenues to be 24-27% higher than the first-quarter 2022 actuals. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2.

Southwest Airlines reported fourth-quarter 2022 loss of 38 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents. In the year-ago reported quarter, LUV had reported earnings of 14 cents per share.Operational disruptions in late December resulted in more than 16,700 flight cancellations. As a result, LUV had to bear a fourth-quarter pre-tax negative impact of almost $800 million ($620 million on an after-tax basis), which resulted in fourth-quarter 2022 net loss. Revenues of $6,172 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,270.9 million but improved 22.2% year over year. Management expects first-quarter 2023 operating revenues to grow in the 20-24% band.4. JetBlue Airways’ fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 15 cents from non-recurring items) of 22 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents.

PM, The Kroger Co. KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE, Lyft, Inc. LYFT and Agilent Technologies, Inc. A.5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for Solid Returns in 2023As the year 2022 ended on a grim note, it’s time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for 2023. While the recent economic data point to some effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like Philip Morris International Inc., The Kroger Co., Expedia Group, Inc., Lyft, Inc. and Agilent Technologies, Inc. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are five of the 31 stocks that qualified for the screening:Story continuesNew York-based Philip Morris manufactures and sells cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products outside the United States.

You can skip this part and go to 5 Undervalued Defensive Stocks For 2023.Investors flocked to defensive stocks in 2022 amid recession fears and massive losses in the growth stocks space. Defensive stocks are favored by investors during tough economic times as companies operating in the space feel little impact of the broader economic downturn. That’s because they sell products and services whose demand remains almost unchanged due to their essential nature. Defensive sectors include consumers staples, healthcare and utilities, among others. As of December 29, the S&amp;P 500 utility stocks as a whole fell 0.5% in 2022, while consumer staples were down 2.7% in the period. Compare this performance to the broader market (SPY) decline of about 20% and you begin to understand why everyone wants to invest in undervalued defensive stocks when things go south.Smart investors are continuing to prefer defensive stocks in 2023 as the economic outlook for this year paints no rosy picture. According a Wall Street Journal report, Lisa Erickson, head of the public markets group at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, believes the starting months of this year would continue to pose challenges. That’s why the investor reportedly said she is recommending dividend-paying defensive stocks to her clients.“We’ve had a perfect setup for defensive companies… With that type of volatility expected again, companies that can provide more of a cash-flow buffer in their returns look attractive,” Erickson reportedly said.Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 20 in the following three defensive sectors: consumer staples, healthcare and utilities. From the resultant dataset, we chose 15 stocks that had the most number of hedge funds invested in them. We also gave priority to dividend-paying companies since they are preferred by investors during recessions. The list is ranked in descending order of PE ratios.Story continuesUndervalued Defensive Stocks For 202315.

While the recent economic data point to some effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like Philip Morris International Inc. PM, The Kroger Co. KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE, Lyft, Inc. LYFT and Agilent Technologies, Inc. A are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio.

(NYSE:ROP) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 27, 2023Operator: Good morning. The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. . I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Zack Moxcey: Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Incoming Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; a legal charge related to the settlement of the Boral versus Verathon patent litigation matter.The case related to the sale of certain Verathon products from 2004 through 2016, there are no future financial obligations for Verathon related to this matter. Next, transaction-related expenses for completed acquisitions, and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activity. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?Story continuesNeil Hunn: Thanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual year-end agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter and full year, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and then the initiation of our 2023 guidance. Let's go and get started. Next slide, please. As we heard on Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are First, we delivered another great year of strategic, operational and financial progress. To this end, we concluded our multiyear divestiture program, which was centered on improving the quality of remaining portfolio, namely emphasizing less cyclical, more asset-light and higher-growth businesses. In addition, we successfully deployed $4.3 billion towards market-leading and application-specific software businesses.More on this later, but we also continue to have substantial M&amp;A firepower well north of $4 billion. Organically, we grew just shy of 10% for the year while simultaneously improving the underlying quality of the enterprise. During the course of the year, our businesses did a terrific job of innovating and capturing share, which leads us to our second main takeaway for today's call that we're well positioned for another solid year of performance in 2023. Our higher quality, less cyclical and more highly recurring nature of our portfolio will serve us well during 2023. Now as I hand the call over to our Incoming CFO, Jason Conley, let me take a moment and thank Rob Crisci for all he's done for Roper and for me. Rob has been a significant contributor to our success and an important member of our executive team with meaningful insights and contributions across a variety of topics, including our most recent portfolio repositioning.We're excited to welcome Jason to his new role. Many of you know, Jason, for those of you who do not, Jason has been with Roper for 16 years. He started in corporate IR and FP&amp;A, then the operating CFO at MHA or one of our businesses and most recently serving as Roper's Chief Accounting Officer. Since he has returned to corporate, he has been a member of our capital allocation team and has attended every Board meeting. The team and I are excited to partner with Jason for the next leg of our evolution. So, with that, looking forward to the partnership, Jason, and thank you, Rob, for all of you done to make Roper better than when you joined. Jason, let me turn the call over to you, can walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial summary.Jason?Jason Conley: Thanks, Neil. I am very excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the team in this new role. And of course, thanks, Rob, for your awesome partnership and mentorship over the years. It's been just a great experience working together. So first, I'd like to introduce Brandon Cross as our new Principal Accounting Officer. Brandon joined Roper about five years ago, progressing to our Assistant Controller and more recently, has led and transformed our audit services function. He has significant M&amp;A and integration experience. So this is a natural and well-earned promotion for him. Brandon, I look forward to working together in your new role.Brandon Cross: Thanks, Jason.Jason Conley: If you indulge me, I'll rip on Roper for a few seconds. I've been blessed to help guide and execute our evolution from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies, which has been underpinned by our North Star belief that cash is the best measure of performance. And as we enter 2023, our best years are ahead of us. We have a family of market-leading businesses with durable growth drivers and terrific free cash flow margins. Further, the leadership teams and talent processes at our businesses are the best in the company's history. And finally, we have significant capacity to execute our proven and disciplined M&amp;A strategy that I've been a part of for many years. I anticipate being quite active on the road this year. So for those on the call, I look forward to either meeting you or reconnecting in the coming months.All right. Let's get into the financials. Turning to Slide 6. We'll do a quick review of our Q4 performance. We capped off a solid year of growth with revenue of over $1.4 billion, which was 14% higher over prior year. Organic growth was 7% with strength across the portfolio, which was enhanced by 10% software recurring revenue growth. Acquisitions added eight points of growth, led by our Frontline business that closed in early October, and currency was a two-point headwind. EBITDA of $592 million, was up 17% over the prior year. We experienced strong operating leverage across the enterprise and improving gross margins in our TEP segment to finish out the year. DEPS came in at $3.92, which was 17% against prior year and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range.Next, we'll look at free cash flow. free cash flow. Free cash flow of $457 million was down 8% over the prior year. Excluding the Section 174 impact, we were down 3%. And factoring out a $30 million Vertafore tax benefit in 2021 that doesn't repeat, we're up about 3% to 4% in the quarter. Taking a broader view, you can see we compounded cash 11% over a four-year period, despite the Section 174 headwind, and we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding going forward. Turning to Slide 7. We'll now do a quick overview of our Q4 segment results, as Neil will unpack more detail on the full year a bit later. We had a nice finish to a great year across the three segments. For Application Software, revenue was up 22% to $740 million, with organic growth of 7%.EBITDA margin increased to 45.6% in the quarter. We had strong SaaS bookings growth and overall solid net retention throughout the year, which is just naturally rolling through recurring revenue in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the segment, aside from some delayed decision-making in the large government contract in space within Deltek. On margin, we had lower incentive-based SG&amp;A and employee medical costs, so some favorability in the quarter. If you look at the full year margin of 44%, that's about where we would expect to be over a longer horizon. Our Network Software segment grew nicely in the quarter, with revenue up 9% to $350 million and EBITDA also up 9% to $189 million or 54% of revenue. Growth was led by our freight matching businesses, which continued driving higher ARPU from premium offerings to offset moderating carry activity as we expected.Tech-enabled products revenue was $340 million and grew 5% organically in the quarter. Demand remained strong, and we had some orders that didn't get delivered toward the end of the quarter, which will benefit Q1. EBITDA grew 7% to $119 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 34.9% or 100 basis points over prior year, with strong operating leverage as the price cost dynamic was neutralized in the quarter. Turning to the full year 2022 performance on Slide 8. Revenue was 11% higher than prior year to $5.4 billion, with 9% organic growth. EBITDA was 12% better to nearly $2.2 billion, with EBITDA margin coming in at 40.4%. The of $14.28, was 15% over prior year and reflected strong P&amp;L leverage against the 11% revenue growth. Notably, compared to our 2018 pre-divestiture financial profile, our revenue is about $175 million higher, while EBITDA is nearly $365 million higher.MacBook Pro, TehnologyPhoto by Tianyi Ma on UnsplashSo, through a combination of organic growth and capital deployment, we've grown despite divesting about 40% of our 2018 revenue. And most importantly, the composition of our portfolio today positions us for higher and more durable growth going forward. Free cash flow came in at about $1.5 billion, so down 7% versus prior year. It's a bit of the same situation as our fourth quarter with both the 2022 headwinds of Section 174 of nearly $100 million and the nonrepeating of the 2021 Vertafore tax benefit of $117 million. If we normalize for those items, free cash flow grew about 8%. We've had a bit of an inventory build within our tech segment as supply has become more available. This is not a new normal, and we certainly expect that to improve in 2023.If we kind of take this up to a multiyear view, you can see we've compounded cash at 15% over a four-year period. And as we look forward, the impact from Section 174 will be fairly neutral, and we expect to convert plus or minus 80% of flow. So, we're clearly well positioned for double-digit growth. Turning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at our financial position. We certainly had a lot going on in Q4. On November 22, we completed the majority sale of our industrial businesses, which are now operating under the name Indicor and received $2.6 billion in upfront proceeds. Also, in the quarter, we paid $270 million, representing all taxes due related to the majority sale. So, this yielded us net proceeds of over $2.3 billion, a very good outcome here indeed.Related to our stake in Indicor, this is now appearing as an equity investment on our balance sheet. We will be updating the fair value of the equity investment each quarter going forward. To provide a clearer picture of our continuing operations, we will provide a non-GAAP adjustment for this fair value accounting and any tax expense related to this investment. So just looking at our balance sheet, even after our $3.7 billion Frontline acquisition, which was completed in October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.7 times. So, our solid leverage profile, coupled with strong free cash flow generation and an undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion, gives us $4 billion plus of M&amp;A capacity. Clearly, we are very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment in 2023.And with that, I will turn the call back over to Neil to go through our segment details. Neil?Neil Hunn: Thanks, Jason, and well done. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 2022 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.64 billion, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Performance across this segment was just solid in 2022. Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies accelerated their growth, led by continued strength in their enterprise class segment. In addition, the two Vertafore bolt-on acquisitions are strategically on point, integrated and performing well. As we've been discussing, SaaS migrations have been a key theme for us over the past few years, and 2022 was no different. Both Aderant and Deltek continued their SaaS migration momentum and both grew nicely based on solid customer adds and strong retention.Deltek was particularly strong in their private sector end markets. But as Jason mentioned, Deltek did see some slower decision-making specific to new bookings in the enterprise segment for their GovCon solutions. At our upcoming March 21 Investor Day, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the leaders at Vertafore, Deltek and Aderant about how they're competing and consistently winning in the market. As it relates to Power Plant, we liked what we saw last year. PowerPlan was strong given their refocused and narrowed strategy combined with a highly aligned team. As a result, PowerPlan crossed a meaningful milestone, launching a SaaS solution for their flagship product, tax fixed assets. Congrats to the team for a great 2022 and looking forward to more great things in 2023.2022 is a very good year for application health care IT businesses as well. Strata's combination with EPSI has just been great. The integration is complete and the number of EPSI, the Strata has conversions and upsell, cross-sell are both meaningfully ahead of our deal expectations. Clinisys and Data Innovations continue to win in the marketplace. The internal combination of Clinisys and Sunquest has rejuvenated and energized their high-performance culture, which is enabling the business to more effectively compete and win in the marketplace. Data Innovations continues to gain share and evolve to become the de facto standard as it relates to Lab Middleware. Finally, Frontline, our cornerstone 2022 acquisition is off to a solid start. We look forward to sharing the strategic and financial success of this business in the quarters and years to come.I'd like to reiterate with what we started with. Performance here strategically, operationally and financially was just great in 2022. Very proud of the team and the performance. Congrats and thanks. Looking to the outlook for 2023, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area based on our market positions and growth in recurring revenues. Turning to Page 12. Revenues in 2022 for our Network Software segment were $1.38 billion, up 13% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.3%. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses were great in 2022. Their exceptional growth is based on many factors, certainly favorable market conditions, but also continued product and network innovations as well as terrific product and package designs that drove increased value for the network participants.iPipeline and iTrade network were stellar performers throughout 2022 and benefited from having strong renewal and expansion activity. iPipeline like that a PowerPlan is benefiting from having a narrowed and more focused strategy, namely tech-enabling the life insurance and annuity distribution network. Moving to Foundry, which had another great year as part of Roper. Foundry continues to be the market-leading software in postproduction media entertainment. During 2022, Foundry's product innovations were impressive with several new features focused on ML-based automation. Starting in 2023, Foundry's flagship product Nuke will begin its subscription transition, so looking forward for solid progress on that front. Growth in our businesses that focus on alternate site health care was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly, retention rates across SHP, SoftWriters and MHA remained extremely high.Broadly, the performance across this segment was great. Congrats to the teams for this terrific year of financial performance. Turning to the outlook for 2023. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across the group and a normalization of market conditions for freight and logistics applications. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in 2022 for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $1.35 billion, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were 35.4% for the year. As expected, EBITDA margins expanded in the second half of the year as pricing and supply chain improvements flow through. Let's start with Neptune, our water meter and technology product business. This past year was just terrific with very strong growth based on strong margin conditions, strong share gains and strong adoption of their static ultrasonic meter technology.In addition, Neptune launched their cellular connectivity solution and did a fantastic job migrating a large chunk of their customer base to their newest data management solution. Spectacular job Neptune, congrats you and your team. Northern Digital, which is our precision measurement tech company, continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI benefits from having a strategy that is laser-focused on health care applications and an R&amp;D capability that is unmatched in the industry. NDI's core tech is using countless life-saving procedures on a daily basis across the globe. Verathon turned in another solid year performance in 2022 as well. The growth is based on momentum across their video innovation and single-use bronchoscope product lines.As you saw in the press release, we did take the opportunity to clean up a legacy patent dispute. Make no mistake, the innovation capability at Verathon is nothing short of exceptional, and we cannot be more confident about their most recent product launches and the new concepts in the development pipeline. As it relates to the single-use rock space, we hope to see Verathon capture the number one market position in North America in 2023. Our outlook for the year in this segment is in the high single-digit area and is based on continued strength in backlog at Neptune as well as continued growth across our medical product businesses. Specific to the first quarter, we do have easier comps versus a year ago. Now please turn to Page 15, and let's review our 2023 and Q1 guidance.For 2023, we're initiating our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.90 and $16.20. Underpinning this guidance is expected organic growth of 5% to 6% and a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the first quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance to be in the $3.80 to $3.84 range. Now please turn with us to our final page, Page 16. As we turn to this page, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, 2022 was a year of great accomplishment for our teams and our enterprise. We grew revenue 11%, 9% on an organic basis. And we did this while continuing to increase the underlying quality of our revenue base. In fact, we delivered double-digit increases in our Software organic recurring revenue during 2022.EBITDA grew 12%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 40.4%. Also, we successfully concluded our multiyear divestiture program and deployed $4.3 billion against our long-standing capital deployment strategy, headlined by Frontline Education. The second key takeaway is that we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding in 2023 based on our organic revenue growth outlook, contributions from our 2022 acquisition cohort and having well north of $4 billion of M&amp;A capacity. To this end, we continue to be very active in the M&amp;A markets. But as you saw during 2022 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. Finally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about the future of enterprise.As we open up to your questions, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, March 21, in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there. So with that, let's open it up to your questions.See also 12 Best S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks To Buy and 12 Cheap Biotech Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:HCA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We initiated a position in HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), one of the nation’s leading providers of health care services. As of September 30, 2022, HCA owned, managed, or operated 182 hospitals and approximately 2,400 ambulatory sites of care in 20 states and the U.K. We think long-term demographic trends as well as HCA’s strong presence in attractive growth markets where there is net population migration position the company well to generate sustainable long-term growth. Prior to the COVID pandemic, management targeted long-term top-line organic growth of 4% to 6% with pricing/mix running in the 2% to 3% range and adjusted patient admissions increasing 2% to 3%. Although COVID has been disruptive to this framework, management believes organic revenue growth can return to its targeted 4% to 6% range with positive margin leverage possible at the high end of the range. Recently, the company has seen contract labor costs and wage pressure start to moderate and volume trends are improving. HCA also has a long-term track record returning capital to shareholders through special dividends and share repurchases.”Story continuesnational-cancer-institute-GcrSgHDrniY-unsplashHCA Healthcare, Inc.

(NYSE:HCA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 27, 2023Operator: Good morning and welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take a few questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sam.Sam Hazen: Alright. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2022 as expected with pre-pandemic seasonality demand norms driving solid volume growth. Additionally, we continue to see progress with our labor agenda. These factors helped produce solid earnings in the fourth quarter that were consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged by this outcome and believe this operational momentum should position us well for 2023. 2022 was a tale of two halves, with the first half being more about winding down from the previous 2 years of intense COVID activity and responding to the resulting challenges. The second half was more about normalization, which included strong demand and an improving labor market. Once again, I believe our people have demonstrated an impressive capability in the face of these dynamic forces and delivered for our patients, the communities we serve and other stakeholders.Story continuesHealthcare people in general are unique, but I believe HCA Healthcare people are even more special. I'll often refer to them as can-do people, and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do each and everyday for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions increased in excess of 5%. Equivalent admissions were up 5.4%, with impressive growth of 11% in the emergency room. Most of our other volume categories had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. The payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter remained at favorable levels. These factors produced revenue growth against a difficult comparison of 3% in the quarter.With respect to our people agenda, we were pleased with the improvements we saw in key metrics. Turnover numbers for registered nurses were down 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous four quarters' average. Our turnover rate is still higher than we want, but we believe it is better than the industry average. Employee engagement scores recovered to around pre-pandemic levels. Again, our engagement is above the industry average. Our recruiting teams continue to generate results for the company. Hiring increased 6% year-over-year in 2022. And lastly, we opened our seventh Galan College of Nursing School this year. With respect to labor costs during the quarter, we experienced stable labor cost per hour with utilization of contract labor declining.As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a robust human resources plan. We executed well on it and expect to make further progress as we move into 2023. It remains a top organizational priority. Even with the progress, we continued this quarter to experience capacity constraints, creating situations where we were unable to deliver services in certain situations. Also in the quarter, we saw value from our portfolio optimization plan and closed two joint ventures with strategic partners; one was with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute, which we combined with McKesson's cancer research entity. We believe the combination of these two entities will produce better cancer research and more clinical trials across the country, providing even more community-based resources for physicians and patients to fight this disease.The second co-venture is with our CoreTrust purchasing organization. We closed on a new partnership with Blackstone. We believe this new relationship can expand our ability to offer commercial purchasing and services solutions to a broader variety of customers. We believe both of these deals achieved our strategic objectives and connected us with better platforms for success in the future. We are excited to partner with both entities. We also implemented our capital plan for the year as expected, including redeploying the proceeds from these two new joint ventures. Bill will provide more details in his comments. And finally, we announced in the last quarter a significant leadership transition that we believe will position the organization better with responding timelier to market dynamics, while also strengthening the alignment of corporate functions to our strategy.The executives who are part of this transition are all proven HCA executives, they understand and appreciate our culture and they know how to execute. As we push ahead into 2023 and beyond, we believe the strong demand for healthcare services presents opportunity for HCA Healthcare in an otherwise challenging macro environment. We believe the company is well-positioned culturally, competitively and financially to capitalize. Our agenda next year will be focused on the following three areas. First, overcoming labor and capacity challenges. Again, we believe we have the appropriate initiatives in place to respond to these. Second, counter inflationary pressures. Again, we have numerous efforts in place to contend with these forces, while ensuring we continue to deliver high-quality outcomes to our patients.Health, Medical, CarePhoto by Online Marketing on UnsplashAnd third, accelerating growth with our winning plays. This agenda continues to leverage capital investments in outpatient facilities, clinical equipment for our physicians and service line expansion. On top of our 2023 agenda, we are also making investments in our long-term plan, which includes four primary elements: the first one is advancing our clinical systems and digital capabilities; second is transforming care models with innovative solutions; third is expanding our workforce development programs; and fourth, is investing capital in our networks to expand their offerings. These efforts are pressuring our results some in the current year, but we believe they are necessary in creating a platform for ultimately optimizing our networks so they can deliver even better patient care in the future.Let me close with this. The last 3 years have been an extraordinary experience for everyone at HCA Healthcare. There has been no rest nor retreat for our people and it was truly a challenge like no other. I strongly believe however that our Board, our management teams and our caregivers have shined through it all. We went into the pandemic with two priorities, to protect our people and to protect the organization so we could continue providing high-quality healthcare to the communities we serve. I believe strongly that we showed up, we delivered on these priorities and we did it the right way. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I am even more proud of our people. The future for our company is even brighter because of the past 3 years and what we learned.Now we will move into 2023 and the years ahead with greater purpose, with a renewed agenda to drive growth and with more confidence in our ability to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call to Bill and he will discuss the quarter's results in more detail and our 2023 guidance.Bill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and the year then discuss our 23 guidance. We finished the year with good volume metrics. Our fourth quarter same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year. For the full year, our same-facility admissions were up 0.5%. Excluding COVID admissions, our same-facility admissions grew 5.4% in the quarter and were up 3.4% for the year. For the full year, COVID admissions accounted for 5.2% of our admissions versus 7.8% in the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.4% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and were up 7.6% for the full year. Our same-facility outpatient surgeries were up slightly in the quarter from the prior year, but increased 5.6% sequentially compared to the third quarter.Same-facility inpatient surgeries were basically flat as compared to the prior year. Both were impacted by 1 less business day in the quarter. Our same-facility revenue per equivalent admission was down 2.6% in the quarter from the prior year as this was influenced by the drop in COVID activity. Sequentially, our non-COVID revenue per equivalent admission increased approximately 3.7% as compared to the third quarter. Our case mix increased just under 2% sequentially from the third quarter and our payer mix remained stable as well. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of higher inflation rates. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins were 20.5% in the quarter and right at 20% for the full year.We continue to focus on our labor plans and supporting our teams, while appropriately managing contract labor and premium pay programs. Our total labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. In addition, our supply cost trends have remained very consistent during the year and we are pleased with these results. Other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures when compared to the prior year, but has run fairly consistent as a percent of revenue throughout 2022. Our cash flow and capital allocation are a key part of our long-term growth and value-creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion in 2022. Our capital spending was just under $4.4 billion for the year, which was slightly higher than our initial expectations due to some year end real estate and information technology purchases.We paid dividends of about $650 million and we repurchased $7 billion of our outstanding stock during the year. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3x to 4x. For full year 2022, we realized approximately $1.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and healthcare entities. So, let me speak to our 2023 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 23 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $61.5 billion and $63.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.525 billion and $4.895 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60.And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.3 billion during the year. So, let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance is impacted by several governmental and policy changes. In 2022, we recognized approximately $280 million in COVID support mainly from DRG add-ons, removal of sequestration cuts and HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. We expect very little revenue from these programs in 2023. Also, as discussed in our first quarter release, we recognized $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses related to the Texas directed payment program that was for the last 4 months of 2021. This program that started on September 1, 21 was not improved until the first quarter of 2022.In addition, we estimate the impact of the 340B related payment reductions to be between $50 million and $100 million. Adjusted for these items, the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance would be in the middle of our historical 4% to 6% growth expectations that we have had over time. Within our guidance, we expect our same facility equivalent admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3% and our revenue per equivalent admission to grow approximately 2%. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.1 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.975 billion. Interest expense will be impacted by both higher rates and anticipated draws under our revolving credit facilities. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about $278 million for the full year and cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $8.5 billion and $9 billion.Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximate $1.5 billion remaining authorization we had under the previous program at the end of the year. In addition, our Board has declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank and we will open it up for Q&amp;A.Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill.

The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”16.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”14.

105,379bb7a7-d00c-3854-9432-0b29294226f8,GS,2023-01-31,Goldman Sachs analysts rate Macy’s as ‘one of the best positioned retail stocks’,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/goldman-sachs-analysts-rate-macy-205501667.html,1675112101,VIDEO,"['GS', 'M']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss a new Goldman note on Macy's stock.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]DAVE BRIGGS: Macy's shares popping a bit on a note from Goldman Sachs calling the retail giant one of the best-positioned retail stocks with notable upside despite what is expected to be a tough year for the broader sector. Analyst Brooke Roach initiated coverage of the stock as a buy. Her $28 price target implies an upside of more than 20% over where the stock closed Friday. Quote, ""We believe M is best positioned to navigate an uncertain but softer landing economic environment,"" Roach said in a note Monday to clients. ""The company is entering '23 in a position of strength with high affinity among customers, improving brand momentum compared with peers.""It just goes on and on, Seana. This is a real surprise for a company that I don't think there was a lot of faith in. You see the stock up just slightly today, up almost 17% this year. I didn't feel that positive momentum, but, elsewhere, look, when Goldman Sachs has it, clearly investors are buying it.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, investors are really listening to this call. I have some questions, though, especially after we heard Macy's come out, warn about how challenging of a couple of quarters it could potentially be for the retailer. And we've heard that similar type of messaging from a number of CEOs, from a number of executives within the retail industry.So, yes, they're saying Macy's is best positioned. I have some questions, though, just in terms of that upside potential, at least over the next couple of quarters. If we do see a stronger-than-expected downturn here or deeper-than-expected downturn, that obviously would be a huge concern here for Macy's, for this sector at large.Goldman, though, reiterating its sell rating on Kohl's. Nordstrom shares were also lower. They were downgraded to neutral. So they're not bullish across the board. Macy's, though, I was a little bit surprised by this call.- Yeah, it just felt like, OK, the retail sector, it's not doing well overall, but Macy's, out of the bunch, best positioned due to those strong margins, best positioned due to some of those profitability tailwinds that they have relative to those competitors.But if you take a look at retail sales, that continues to tick higher. The consumer is pressured. You mentioned that warning from Macy's that the holiday quarter will likely come in softer due to inflation. So it seems like Macy's is like the lesser of the evils there, but, overall, it's a very tough environment for this sector.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Investors began to pile into value stocks in 2022 as financial markets wavered amid rising inflation, the Fed’s policy tightening and an uncertain geopolitical situation. The broader market's rotation towards value stocks is expected to continue this year as well, believe experts at Goldman Sachs, according to a Bloomberg report published earlier in January.  A Goldman Sachs team led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a note that value stocks will gain more traction in 2023 as tech stocks continue to feel margin pressure.The euphoric rise of technology stocks after the pandemic gave way to speculative buying. Investors were willing to pay a premium for loss-making tech companies whose profits lie far into the future. But as the market began to correct itself, investors grew more wary about tech stocks and were unable to develop a stomach for huge risks. The Bloomberg report also quoted several experts who think value stocks will be preferred over tech plays in the months to come. For example, Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian said, according to the report, that investors should “avoid crowded parts of the stock market, including big tech.”Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson also reportedly warned that profit margins at tech companies are likely to take a hit this year.Investors are now preferring value stocks with strong fundamentals and profitable businesses. Many of the popular value stocks also pay dividends. As you will see in this article, financial, energy and healthcare dominate this space. On the other hand, value investors are continuing to avoid tech stocks that are loss-making and don’t have strong growth prospects in the short term. However, major tech stocks, like Meta Platforms, are on the radar of value investors since tech companies of this scale are offering attractive entry points for investors, according to some analysts. More on that later in the article. First, let’s see our methodology for this article.Story continuesOur  MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the top holdings of Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) and picked stocks that have PE ratios of less than 18 as of January 26. The result was a long list of stocks. We then picked 15 of these stocks that have the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of the end of the third quarter. For that we used Insider Monkey’s premium database of 920 hedge funds. That means the stocks mentioned in this article are some of the most popular undervalued value stocks among elite hedge funds.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 493M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. A total of 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) at the end of the September quarter.14. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ranks 14th in our list of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has upped its dividends consistently for over a decade now. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)’s dividend yield as of January 26 stands at over 3% while its PE ratio is 15.68. Earlier in January, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.775 per share, in line with previous. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.38%.As of the end of the third quarter, 52 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), compared to 58 funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes was $3.3 billion.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)13. EOG Resources, Inc.

109,7f953d02-14ac-345a-b787-1f5ee106c3d7,SLB,2023-01-31,Oil Services ETFs in Focus on Strong Q4 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-services-etfs-focus-strong-192707381.html,1675106827,STORY,"['HAL', 'SLB']","[Big oil services companies started releasing their quarterly numbers from last week. The outlook is bullish this time thanks to the upbeat oil market. OPEC+ output cut is in place. The group seeks to maintain a recovery in crude prices. China has re-opened its economy that boosted the demand outlook for energy.Against this backdrop, a close monitoring of the energy space, which deals with oil field services, is warranted. Let’s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space.In this piece, we have considered two stocks, namely – Schlumberger SLB and Halliburton HAL.Schlumberger in FocusSchlumberger Limited has reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of 71 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. The bottom line significantly increased from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 41 cents.The oilfield service giant recorded total quarterly revenues of $7,879 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,821 million. The top line also improved from the year-ago quarter’s $6,225 million. The strong quarterly results have been primarily driven by strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America.Halliburton in FocusHalliburton Company reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 72 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents and well above the year-ago quarter profit of 36 cents (adjusted). The outperformance reflects stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions.Meanwhile, revenues of $5.6 billion were 30.5% higher than the corresponding period of 2021 and also came just ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate (by some $3 million). Investors should know that HAL has outsized exposure to the North American land drilling market.Market ImpactInvestors might want to know the impact of earnings results on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies. Below we highlight three oil-services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus:Story continuesVanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF OIHOIH invests $2.89 billion of assets in 25 holdings and devotes as much as 19.74% of the portfolio weight to SLB, followed by 11.73% in HAL. Generally, when one stock accounts for as much as 20% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund’s price movement. OIH gained 2.3% in the past five days (as of Jan 28, 2022).iShares US Oil Equipment &amp; Services ETF IEZThis ETF invests about $406.5 million of assets in about 29 securities, focusing solely on the energy world. The in-focus SLB takes up the first position here with 21.95% of holdings. HAL takes up the second position with about 20.67% of total assets. The fund IEZ has added 2% past five days.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLEXLE invests about $42.44 billion of assets in 23 stocks. The fund puts 4.83% of the portfolio weight in SLB.

Also, widespread supply-chain disruptions and labor market constraints remained as major overhangs for service stocks. The fear of an economic slowdown impacted consumer spending negatively.The sector is a major beneficiary of manufacturing and service activities and both entered a contraction phase in the fourth quarter. In December, the manufacturing sector contracted for the second consecutive month after 29 months of expansion. The service sector contracted for the first time after a 30-month period of expansion.Nevertheless, the sector has plenty of driving factors, which cannot be ignored. The essentiality of certain services like waste management and pest control, rise in demand for risk mitigation and consulting services, increased expertise in improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, successful work-from-home models, growing adoption of cloud-based services and digital transformation acted as tailwinds in the quarter.Earnings Expectations for Q4Perthe latest Earnings Trends report, the business services sector is likely to record a 1.6% decline in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 despite a 3.5% sales increase. The projected movement implies a deceleration from 6.8% rise in earnings on a 9.5% increase in revenues in the third quarter. Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR, Verisk Analytics, Inc. VRSK, Gartner, Inc.

111,5722cd85-5891-3439-aeea-78cd4b47d8fd,NTRS,2023-01-31,Is FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexshares-international-quality-dividend-etf-112011245.html,1675164011,STORY,['NTRS'],"[Designed to provide broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market, the FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 04/12/2013.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexIQDF is managed by Flexshares, and this fund has amassed over $517.44 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, IQDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.47%.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.15%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) accounts for about 2.87% of total assets, followed by Bhp Group Ltd (BHP) and Roche Holding Ag Common Stock Chf 0 (ROG).Performance and RiskThe ETF has added about 8.58% and is down about -4.76% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 01/31/2023), respectively. IQDF has traded between $17.72 and $25.82 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.83 and standard deviation of 22.29% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 268 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $35.24 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $87.95 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs US equity strategy chief David Kostin noted in the beginning of November that despite Q3 GDP exceeding expectations, the US economy still appears to be headed towards a recession. During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs. Some firms that are aggressively buying back shares according to Goldman Sachs include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Investors can also check out 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks and 10 Stocks with Biggest Buybacks. Our Methodology Goldman Sachs searched for stocks that have a net buyback yield of at least 5%, which means these companies have repurchased 5% or more of their shares outstanding in proportion to their market capitalization over the past year, and have increased their buyback rate during that period. Below is a list of 20 companies that increased buybacks by at least 5% in the previous 12 months as of November 2, along with net buyback yield for each and share price returns from November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around the securities as of the third quarter of 2022.  The list is ranked in ascending order of net buyback yield.Story continues20 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman SachsSource:PixabayStocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman Sachs20.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

MET is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MET’s fourth-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.76, which indicates a decline of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number and is lower than our estimate of $1.77.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $16,952 million, suggesting a 16.1% fall from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Earnings Surprise HistoryMetLife boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.00%. This is depicted in the chart below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteIn the fourth quarter, the revenues of MetLife are likely to have suffered due to declining premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums is pegged at $10,841 million, which indicates a 17.2% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure and is lower than our estimate of $10,976.8 million.Reduced variable investment income leading to declining net investment income coupled with lower universal life and investment-type product policy fees might have dampened MET’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus mark for net investment income and universal life and investment-type product policy fees stands at $4,308 million and $1,236 million, indicating a decline of 17.7% and 13.1%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimates for the metrics came higher than our estimates of $3,704.4 million and $1,088.3 million, respectively.Meanwhile, the softer performance of the Asia segment is expected to have dampened the quarterly performance of MetLife. The unit might have suffered a blow due to lower variable investment income and feeble underwriting results in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings of MET’s Asia business is pegged at $364 million, suggesting a 37.9% plunge from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Story continuesNevertheless, the downside to the quarterly results is likely to have been partly offset by strong performances of the U.S., Latin America and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) segments. Solid volumes coupled with a significant decline in COVID life insurance claims might have contributed to the sound performance of the U.S. business in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for the segments’ adjusted earnings stands at $742 million, which indicates an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Both the Latin America segment and the EMEA segment are expected to have benefited on the back of robust sales in the fourth quarter.

CRL is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results soon.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.78%. Earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.56%.Let’s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe Research Models and Services (RMS) segment is likely to have gained from continued global demand for research models and associated services. The company’s ongoing initiatives to boost operating performances by HemaCare and Cellero are anticipated to have had a beneficial impact on the cell supply business.The ongoing broad-based demand and meaningful price increases in the Research Model business, particularly in North America, as well as Global Research Models Services, particularly Insourcing Solutions and GEMS, driven by increased research activities in this geography are expected to have contributed to the top line in Q4. However, an adverse impact related to China's COVID restrictions through the months of Q4 is likely to have disrupted RMS revenues.Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCharles River Laboratories International, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, the company’s CRADLE or Charles River Accelerator and Development Labs initiative including the recent Explora acquisition is anticipated to have maintained its growth momentum in Q4, benefiting the in-sourcing solutions business within the RMS arm. Further, the renewed focus on biomedical research has also led to increased demand and share gains for small research models, particularly in North America and China. This might have also contributed to the company’s RMS revenue growth in Q4. Charles River is also expected to have benefited in Q4 from price increases, which partially offset inflationary cost pressure.Story continuesThe Discovery and Safety Assessment (DSA) arm is likely to have benefited from a strong biotechnology client base and robust backlog at the end of 2021. In the last reported quarter, The DSA growth rate surpassed the 20% level, in line with the company’s initial forecast of meaningful DSA growth acceleration throughout the year 2022. The ongoing demand, the company’s competitive strengths and the geographic reach of the portfolio within the DSA arm are expected to have once again led to significant revenue growth in Q4 as well.Further, amid the staffing shortage issue, Charles River expects recent hires to help the company meet the accelerating DSA growth outlook over the course of 2022. This should get reflected in the Q4 results.Within the DSA arm, the Safety Assessment business has been witnessing strong demand and price increases. The company expects growth in this business, banking on strong business trends with higher pricing and increased demand for the Safety Assessment line.The Discovery business is likely to have gained from continued strong performances by early discovery and CNS services. Of late, Charles River has been witnessing growing client interest in integrated drug discovery programs. To meet the robust client demand for Discovery Services, the company has been closely managing staffing levels and introducing cutting-edge capabilities. The company has also been consistently expanding its discovery portfolio through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. We expect these ongoing business trends and initiatives to have fueled growth during the fourth quarter.The Manufacturing Support segment is likely to have been driven by revenue growth across the Microbial Solutions and Biologics Testing Solutions businesses. The company has been recording strong demand across its portfolio of critical quality control testing solutions within the Microbial Solutions business. Meanwhile, we anticipate the continued uptake of cell and gene therapy testing services for the Biologics Testing Solutions business to have driven revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.04 billion, suggesting a 15.2% rise over the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings per share of $2.75 indicates a 10.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

Injuries no doubt hurt the ratings as the Eagles eviscerated the Niners, down to their fourth string QB. But a massive number well north of 30, probably 40 million no doubt watched Patrick Mahomes escape the top burrow, and the Bengals should get those numbers later tonight-- just the latest example of the NFL continuing to assert its will over the entire television landscape.However, the league took a big L in their streaming kickoff-- ratings for Amazon Thursday Night Football down an astounding 41% from 2021 from an average of 16.4 million to fewer than 10 million viewers. Ratings for ESPN solid just slightly down from last season-- 13.4 million.Eagles-Chiefs will be awesome more than 110 million people-- excuse me-- will watch, while the battle bean counters are considering is ratings versus revenue. And this one is a blowout, unlike the Super Bowl. Amazon and the NFL want more viewers on Thursday night, but cash is king here. The league still featured 88 of the top 100 most watched shows in 2022.And here's the score that matters most-- $113 billion over 11 seasons. That's how much the league's media partners will fork over. YouTube Sunday NFL Ticket deal said to be worth as much as $2.5 bill per year. The Commish-- he sees cord cutting accelerating more than 20 million since 2014, a number expected to grow to 80 million by '26. The most common age group to adios cable-- 18 to 29-year-olds.Amazon would point out their median age viewer this season is 47. That may sound old. It's seven years younger than the legacy networks. The ratings will improve as streaming picks up. And the matchups will also improve. Al Michaels called them dreadful and equated them to selling used cars. They have to be better. But like the big banks, the NFL is too big to fail. And they're too big to care about one ratings miss. Like recent earnings reports, guidance is all that matters here. And football is 100% recession proof.Story continuesMy point being, a lot of people are making a lot on this streaming number, Seana, and for good reason. It's Amazon. But they're not scared. They're not scared one bit. Growth is all there. The league will continue to explode when it comes to television ratings. And Amazon's numbers, I think, will grow over the years. NFL's big question was, would it look competent? Would the stream go down? Would the broadcasters be solid? It looked just like NBC or CBS, except for the awful matchups.SEANA SMITH: Well, it was just an amazing, amazing way that they did this season. Like you were saying, expectations were so low. I think initially there was a lot of fanfare about how maybe they would include certain things that would just stick out just in terms of streaming versus traditional cable. Clearly, we didn't get that. But like you're saying, there was no huge mishaps in terms of--DAVE BRIGGS: Nothing.SEANA SMITH: --airing these games. That was a massive win for Amazon. Everything that's come out of Amazon saying how pleased they were, how excited they were, with how smooth this season went-- big question, I think, going forward as we do see more and more games stream here over the next several years, just how that, of course, then differs. Lots of questions about how Amazon might be able to incorporate more of its business, its prime business into those broadcasts.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: But clearly, NFL is a massive winner here. Super Bowl coming up-- like you said, about 110 million people expected to watch.DAVE BRIGGS: No question.SEANA SMITH: No slowing down in the NFL right now.DAVE BRIGGS: I expect that shopping will inevitably become part of the NFL Amazon broadcast.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't think we're going to see it for three, four, maybe even five years, as they want to prove competency first. But keep an eye on this-- Black Friday--SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: --NFL game this coming season on NFL on Amazon. I don't know how there won't be some type of--SEANA SMITH: They have to.DAVE BRIGGS: --shopping collaboration. It's unavoidable.SEANA SMITH: Oh, it's unavoidable. And it's so, so smart here for Amazon to go and--DAVE BRIGGS: What have you got, Eagles or Chiefs?SEANA SMITH: Eagles. I'm from Philly. It's not even a question.DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: You do?DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: We're going to talk about it.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Midstream results in the fourth quarter included restructuring costs of $18 million related to the integration of DCP Midstream, LP and its general partner entities (collectively referred to as ""DCP Midstream""), while third-quarter included a net gain of $3 billion related to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC, and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC, and the transfer of interest in Gray Oak Pipeline LLC, as a result of the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC, and Gray Oak Holdings, LLC, effective August 17, 2022.Transportation fourth-quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $237 million, compared with adjusted pre-tax income of $229 million in the third quarter.NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income was $448 million in the fourth quarter, compared with adjusted pre-tax income of $412 million in the third quarter. The increase was mainly driven by higher fractionation volumes, as well as a full quarter of consolidated results of DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC, and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC.In the fourth quarter, the fair value of the company’s investment in NOVONIX, Ltd., decreased by $11 million compared with a $33 million decrease in the third quarter.ChemicalsMillions of DollarsPre-Tax IncomeAdjusted Pre-Tax IncomeQ4 2022Q3 2022Q4 2022Q3 2022Chemicals$ 5213552135The Chemicals segment reflects Phillips 66’s equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Chemicals fourth-quarter 2022 reported and adjusted pre-tax income was $52 million, compared with $135 million in the third quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly due to lower margins and volumes, partially offset by decreased utilities costs and the impact of third-quarter legal accruals. Global olefins and polyolefins utilization was 83% for the quarter.RefiningMillions of DollarsPre-Tax IncomeAdjusted Pre-Tax IncomeQ4 2022Q3 2022Q4 2022Q3 2022Refining$ 1,6402,9071,6262,883Refining fourth-quarter 2022 pre-tax income was $1.6 billion, compared with pre-tax income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2022.

The decrease was due primarily to lower realized margins. Realized margins declined from $26.87 per barrel in the third quarter to $19.73 per barrel in the fourth quarter mainly due to lower market crack spreads and clean product differentials. The global market crack spread, excluding RIN costs, decreased from $28.18 per barrel in the third quarter to $23.58 per barrel in the fourth quarter.Pre-tax turnaround costs for the fourth quarter were $236 million.

The increase in the fourth quarter was mainly due to a transfer tax on a foreign entity reorganization, as well as higher employee-related expenses and net interest expense.Financial Position, Liquidity and Return of CapitalPhillips 66 generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding working capital impacts, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion.During the quarter, Phillips 66 repaid $500 million of senior notes due April 2023 and DCP Midstream, LP redeemed its $500 million Series A preferred units.

In January 2023, Phillips 66 reached an agreement to acquire all publicly held common units of DCP Midstream, LP in exchange for cash. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 and will increase the company’s economic interest in DCP Midstream, LP to 86.8%.

In addition, Phillips 66 expects to capture over $300 million of commercial and operating synergies.Additionally, the company completed Frac 4 at the end of the third quarter, achieving full rates in early October.

Both projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023.Phillips 66 is focused on improving refining operations to increase crude capacity availability, enhance market capture and reduce costs. In addition, the company is converting its San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed refinery conversion project is expected to begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, the facility will have over 50,000 BPD (800 million gallons per year) of renewable fuel production capacity.

Words such as ""anticipated,"" ""estimated,"" ""expected,"" ""planned,"" ""scheduled,"" ""targeted,"" ""believe,"" ""continue,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""objective,"" ""goal,"" ""project,"" ""efforts,"" ""strategies"" and similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on management’s expectations, estimates and projections as of the date they are made. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not unduly rely on them as they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: the effects of any widespread public health crisis and its negative impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products; the inability to timely obtain or maintain permits necessary for capital projects; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect programs like the renewable fuel standards program, low carbon fuel standards and tax credits for biofuels; fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, and natural gas prices, and petrochemical and refining margins; our ability to consummate the pending acquisition of the outstanding public common units of DCP Midstream, LP and the timing and cost associated therewith; our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the integration of DCP Midstream, LP and from the pending acquisition, if consummated; the diversion of management’s time on transaction and integration-related matters; the success of the company’s Business Transformation initiatives and the realization of savings from actions taken in connection therewith; unexpected changes in costs for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities; unexpected difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products; the level and success of drilling and production volumes around our midstream assets; risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions of actual or potential competitive suppliers and transporters of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels or specialty products; lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas, and refined products; potential liability from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations; failure to complete construction of capital projects on time and within budget; the inability to comply with governmental regulations or make capital expenditures to maintain compliance; limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets, which may also impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends; potential disruption of our operations due to accidents, weather events, including as a result of climate change, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks; general domestic and international economic and political developments including armed hostilities (including the Russia-Ukraine war), expropriation of assets, and other political, economic or diplomatic developments; international monetary conditions and exchange controls; changes in governmental policies relating to NGL, crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, or renewable fuels pricing, regulation or taxation, including exports; changes in estimates or projections used to assess fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment and/or strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio that cause impairment charges; investments required, or reduced demand for products, as a result of environmental rules and regulations; changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations (including alternative energy mandates); political and societal concerns about climate change that could result in changes to our business or increase expenditures, including litigation-related expenses; the operation, financing and distribution decisions of equity affiliates we do not control; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Phillips 66’s businesses generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Phillips 66 is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information—This news release includes the terms ""adjusted earnings,"" ""adjusted earnings per share"" and ""adjusted pre-tax income."" These are non-GAAP financial measures that are included to help facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods and to help facilitate comparisons with other companies in our industry, by excluding items that do not reflect the core operating results of our businesses in the current period. References in the release to earnings refer to net income attributable to Phillips 66.This news release also includes the terms ""sustaining capital"" and ""adjusted EBITDA,"" which are non-GAAP financial measures. Sustaining capital is a component of total capital expenditures, which is the most directly comparably GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this release, is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as estimated net income plus estimated net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as estimated EBITDA plus the proportional share of selected equity affiliates’ estimated net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization less the portion of estimated adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the consolidated company and income before income taxes is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, including amounts that will be attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income or segment income before income taxes without unreasonable effort.Basis of Presentation— During the fourth quarter of 2022, we changed the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer to evaluate results and allocate resources to reflect the realignment of certain businesses between segments and business lines. We determined this realignment resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. Accordingly, prior period results have been recast for comparability. The primary effects of this realignment included moving the results of certain processing assets at our Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries from the Midstream segment (NGL and Other) to the Refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the Refining segment by the Marketing and Specialties segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the Marketing and Specialties segment to the Refining segment. Additionally, we no longer present disaggregated business line results for our Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties segments.Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated20222021Q4Q3YearQ4YearReconciliation of Consolidated Earnings to Adjusted EarningsConsolidated Earnings$ 1,8845,39111,0241,2731,317Pre-tax adjustments:Impairments————1,496Certain tax impacts———(11)(11)Pension settlement expense———1077Hurricane-related costs(14)(24)(21)3445Winter-storm-related costs———(14)51Alliance shutdown-related costs1——26192192Regulatory compliance costs——70(88)(88)Restructuring costs27874177——Merger transaction costs—1313——Gain on consolidation—(3,013)(3,013)——Tax impact of adjustments3(14)681635(33)(420)Other tax impacts(25)——(65)(85)Noncontrolling interests(10)—(10)—(53)Adjusted earnings$ 1,8993,1228,9011,2982,521Earnings per share of common stock (dollars)$ 3.9711.1623.272.882.97Adjusted earnings per share of common stock (dollars)4$ 4.006.4618.792.945.70Reconciliation of Segment Pre-Tax Income (Loss) to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss)Midstream Pre-Tax Income$ 6563,6084,7345591,500Pre-tax adjustments:Impairments————208Pension settlement expense———18Hurricane-related costs———44Winter-storm-related costs————2Alliance shutdown-related costs1———7070Merger transaction costs—1313——Gain on consolidation—(3,013)(3,013)——Restructuring costs218—18——Adjusted pre-tax income$ 6746081,7526341,792Chemicals Pre-Tax Income$ 521358564361,844Pre-tax adjustments:Pension settlement expense———222Hurricane-related costs————1Winter-storm-related costs———(14)32Adjusted pre-tax income$ 521358564241,899Refining Pre-Tax Income (Loss)$ 1,6402,9077,816408(2,353)Pre-tax adjustments:Impairments————1,288Certain tax impacts———(11)(11)Pension settlement expense———537Hurricane-related costs(14)(24)(21)3040Winter-storm-related costs————17Alliance shutdown-related costs1——26122122Regulatory compliance costs——70(88)(88)Adjusted pre-tax income (loss)$ 1,6262,8837,891466(948)Marketing and Specialties Pre-Tax Income$ 5398282,4024701,723Pre-tax adjustments:Pension settlement expense———16Adjusted pre-tax income$ 5398282,4024711,729Corporate and Other Pre-Tax Loss$ (340)(320)(1,169)(246)(974)Pre-tax adjustments:Pension settlement expense———14Restructuring costs26074159——Adjusted pre-tax loss$ (280)(246)(1,010)(245)(970)1 Costs related to the shutdown of the Alliance Refinery totaled $192 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2021. Shutdown-related costs recorded in the Refining segment include pre-tax charges for asset retirements of $91 million recorded in depreciation and amortization expense, and severance and other exit costs of $31 million. Shutdown-related costs in the Midstream segment include asset retirements of $70 million pre-tax recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. Costs related to the shutdown of the Alliance Refinery totaled $26 million pre-tax in the second quarter of 2022. Shutdown-related costs recorded in the Refining segment include pre-tax charges for the disposal of materials and supplies of $20 million, and asset retirements of $6 million recorded in depreciation and amortization expense.2 Midstream results in the fourth quarter of 2022 included pre-tax restructuring costs of $18 million related to the integration of DCP Midstream, of which $10 million was attributed to noncontrolling interests. Corporate results for the fourth quarter of 2022 included net pre-tax restructuring costs of $60 million related to Phillips 66’s multi-year business transformation efforts, which includes a held-for-sale asset impairment of $45 million.3 We generally tax effect taxable U.S.-based special items using a combined federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 24%. Taxable special items attributable to foreign locations likewise use a local statutory income tax rate. Nontaxable events reflect zero income tax. These events include, but are not limited to, most goodwill impairments, transactions legislatively exempt from income tax, transactions related to entities for which we have made an assertion that the undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, or transactions occurring in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance.4 2022 and Q3 2022 are based on adjusted weighted-average diluted shares of 473,728 thousand and 483,035 thousand, respectively.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 3.1% last week. However, the 13% one-year return to shareholders might have softened the blow. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amgen, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Amgen does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.9% and 5.4% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Amgen Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$211m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Amgen. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

One sets a 5% discount to Humira’s monthly price of $6,922. The other will be about half price but may not be widely available.Most patients’ co-insurance costs are set as a percentage of list price and are expected to be calculated off the higher price.At least another seven Humira biosimilars are expected this summer and could debut with discounted list prices. Even then, patient groups, pharmacists, doctors and academics said they will be obscured by the U.S. private insurance system of middlemen negotiation and after-market discounts called rebates.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) say that the deep discounts they receive are returned to insurers and employers to lower their overall medical costs.Benjamin Rome, a drug pricing researcher at Harvard Medical School, said introduction of biosimilars in the United States has not sent prices tumbling as originally expected.Unlike pills, which have extremely cheap generic copies, complex, expensive biologic drugs made from living cells cannot be exactly duplicated. Their closest alternatives are called biosimilars.""The bottom line is it’s feasible that even if prices for Humira and biosimilars go down, this could be in the form of higher rebates to PBMs rather than actual lower prices that are passed onto patients,"" Rome said.The U.S. pays the highest drug prices in the world, in part because many different private sector companies do not have the power of a single government payer.The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act will allow the government’s Medicare program for people aged 65 and older to negotiate prices of its most costly medicines, but drugs like Humira with direct competition are excluded.Story continuesHumira - the world's biggest selling non-COVID prescription drug - is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis.A 5% lower list price would result in a savings of about $35 a month for a person whose coinsurance payment is 10% of the list price.Some patients who qualify for AbbVie’s patient assistance programs pay heavily discounted rates. Amgen has launched a similar savings program for its version.There are currently about half a dozen drugs with biosimilar competition in the United States. Prices of those have decreased up to 20%, according to a report from the National Bureau of Economic Research.Amgen has set list prices of $1,557 and $3,288 per 40 milligram pen device, a two-week supply. Amgen executive Murdo Gordon told Reuters the lower price would attract healthcare systems that act as both an insurer and a provider and typically do not seek after-market discounts.""If you think of a pharmaceutical benefit manager, they would prefer the high list price, because their business model is extracting rebates from manufacturers and passing them on to their employer, customers or their downstream health plan customers,"" Gordon said.UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRX and Cigna Corp said last year they had deals to make Humira, as well as rivals from Amgen and others, available under the same pricing and access terms. CVS Health, another large PBM, plans to include the drug on its coverage list but as non-preferred with less favorable terms.JC Scott, president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, said PBMs want more competition in the prescription drug marketplace and discouraged delays sought by drugmakers.""The bottom line is that increased competition is the most effective and sustainable way to drive prescription drug costs down,"" he said.LIST PRICES TO FALLIn Europe, where governments negotiate drug prices, AbbVie offered up to 80% discounts in November 2018, a month after Humira went off patent, Reuters reported.Additional AbbVie patents continued to protect it in the United States, and the company struck deals with Amgen and others to allow rival drugs in exchange for royalty payments.AbbVie declined to comment.Douglas Hoey, chief executive of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said he expected U.S. prices for drugs of this type to fall about 15%-20% after new competition enters in July.But Robert Popovian, the chief science policy officer at patient advocacy group Global Healthy Living Foundation, said it would take further market and public pressure after the summer entries to get list prices down.Analysts expect the introduction of biosimilar competition will drive down Humira sales. They are forecasting sales of $21.2 billion in 2022, dropping to $13.4 billion this year and $8.3 billion in 2024, according to Refinitiv. Analysts expect Amgen’s biosimilar to garner sales of $747.6 million in 2023 and $933.8 million in 2024.Marcus Snow, a rheumatologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said he would prescribe adalimumab, the chemical name for Humira, based on price and each patient’s insurance coverage terms.All things being equal, he said, he would keep existing patients on Humira and try to put new patients on the medicine that was most likely to be given preference on formularies in the future, to avoid switching.""I wouldn't expect to see the price changes that we all hope to have in the first year,"" Snow said.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove in New York; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

To learn more, visit AMJEVITA.com.Story continuesAmgen currently has 11 biosimilar medicines in market or under development. Five are FDA-approved in the U.S. and three are approved in the European Union.About AMJEVITA™ (adalimumab-atto)AMJEVITA is a biosimilar to Humira®* (adalimumab), an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody. The active ingredient of AMJEVITA is an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody that has the same amino acid sequence as Humira. AMJEVITA is approved to treat seven inflammatory diseases including moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults, moderate-to-severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, psoriatic arthritis in adults, ankylosing spondylitis in adults, moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults, moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older and moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in adults.2 AMJEVITA outside the U.S. is marketed as AMGEVITA® (adalimumab) and has been prescribed to more than 300,000 patients in over 60 countries.*Humira® is a registered trademark of AbbVie, Inc.In the U.S., AMJEVITA is indicated for:reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, alone or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs.reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, alone or in combination with methotrexate.reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis, alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs.reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older.the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients. The effectiveness of adalimumab products has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers.the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. AMJEVITA should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician.AMJEVITA™ U.S. Important Safety InformationSERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with AMJEVITA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. Discontinue AMJEVITA if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis (TB), including reactivation of latent TB. Patients with TB have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease. Test patients for latent TB before AMJEVITA use and during therapy. Initiate treatment for latent TB prior to AMJEVITA use.Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis and pneumocystosis. Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider empiric anti-fungal therapy in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness. Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.Carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment with AMJEVITA prior to initiating therapy in patients: 1. with chronic or recurrent infection, 2. who have been exposed to TB, 3. with a history of opportunistic infection, 4. who resided in or traveled in regions where mycoses are endemic, 5. with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Monitor patients closely for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with AMJEVITA, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.Do not start AMJEVITA during an active infection, including localized infections.Patients older than 65 years, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants may be at greater risk of infection.If an infection develops, monitor carefully and initiate appropriate therapy.Drug interactions with biologic products: A higher rate of serious infections has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. An increased risk of serious infections has been seen with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no demonstrated added benefit in patients with RA. Concomitant administration of AMJEVITA with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra or abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based on the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.MALIGNANCYLymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF-blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.  Consider the risks and benefits of AMJEVITA prior to initiating or continuing therapy in a patient with known malignancy.In clinical trials of some TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies were observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control patients.Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was reported during clinical trials for adalimumab-treated patients. Examine all patients, particularly those with a history of prolonged immunosuppressant or PUVA therapy, for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with AMJEVITA.In adalimumab clinical trials, there was an approximate 3-fold higher rate of lymphoma than expected in the general U.S. population. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk of lymphoma than the general population, even in the absence of TNF blockers.Postmarketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia were reported with TNF blocker use. Approximately half of the postmarketing cases of malignancies in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving TNF blockers were lymphomas; other cases included rare malignancies associated with immunosuppression and malignancies not usually observed in children and adolescents.HYPERSENSITIVITYAnaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, stop AMJEVITA and institute appropriate therapy.HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATIONUse of TNF blockers, including AMJEVITA, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers. Some cases have been fatal.  Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in patients who are carriers of HBV and monitor them during and after AMJEVITA treatment. Discontinue AMJEVITA and begin antiviral therapy in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Exercise caution when resuming AMJEVITA after HBV treatment.NEUROLOGIC REACTIONSTNF blockers, including adalimumab products, have been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system and peripheral demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Exercise caution when considering AMJEVITA for patients with these disorders; discontinuation of AMJEVITA should be considered if any of these disorders develop.HEMATOLOGICAL REACTIONSRare reports of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, have been reported with TNF blockers. Medically significant cytopenia has been infrequently reported with adalimumab products.  Consider stopping AMJEVITA if significant hematologic abnormalities occur. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILUREWorsening or new onset congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have been observed with adalimumab products; exercise caution and monitor carefully.AUTOIMMUNITYTreatment with adalimumab products may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in development of a lupus-like syndrome. Discontinue treatment if symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome develop.IMMUNIZATIONSPatients on AMJEVITA should not receive live vaccines. Pediatric patients, if possible, should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating AMJEVITA therapy. Adalimumab is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero exposed infant. The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products in utero is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live-attenuated) exposed infants. ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions in adalimumab clinical trials (&gt;10%) were: infections (e.g., upper respiratory, sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache, and rash.Please see the accompanying AMJEVITA full Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Michael Strapazon, 805-313-5553 (media) Jessica Akopyan 805-440-5721 (media)Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)ReferencesData on File.

138,aeb0f8a7-08b7-3cc2-a408-703f3595bc7e,AMGN,2023-01-31,15 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-neuroscience-companies-world-143803722.html,1675089483,STORY,"['AZN', 'AMGN', 'BIIB', 'NBIX', 'ABT']","[In this article, we will discuss the 15 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World. You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World.As the name suggests, neuroscience concerns itself with the development, structure, and functions of the nervous system, intending to enhance neurological health. According to the World Health Organization, one out of every three persons will suffer from a neurological disorder at some point in their lives, making these disorders the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death, accounting for approximately 9 million deaths each year.At the same time, WHO recognizes that in most countries, the ""treatment gap"" for these disorders is ""unacceptably high."" This implies a massive opportunity for neuroscience companies. As per IMARC, the global neuroscience market was valued at $32.22 billion in 2021 and is expected to rise to $41.24 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 3.80%.Drug development in this sector has high costs and low success rates, and there have been several expensive late-stage clinical failures. All these reasons have led to Big Pharma retreating from this sector over the last decade. This leaves disruptive startups to push forward innovation within neuroscience. Some of these startups are involved in researching treatments for neural diseases and mental health problems. According to Business Insider, startups in this field raised $548.5 million in investments between January 2022 and September 2022. From Capsida Biotherapeutics, which uses gene therapy to treat illnesses of the central nervous system, to Neumora, which combines data science and neuroscience to develop precision medications for brain disorders, startups are coming up with innovative solutions to neurological problems.However, we must keep in mind that the majority of these treatments are still in the research stage and have not yet been approved for commercial usage. Recently, Eisai and Biogen announced that their drug, Lecanemab, slowed cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients by 27% in a clinical trial. However, certain patients were also exposed to the drug's adverse side effects. This discovery caused quite a stir in scientific circles because it could be a significant breakthrough in Alzheimer's treatment if more studies and peer reviews establish its effectiveness and safety.Story continuesBiggest Neuroscience Companies Photo by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashOn the other hand, some neuroscience companies have more futuristic ambitions. These startups promise to use technology to read your mind to treat illnesses and improve brain performance. Instead of creating drugs, the discipline of neuro-tech is concerned with the development of brain-machine interfaces, neuroprosthetics, neurostimulation, neuromonitoring, and other similar technologies.Recently, Elon Musk's neuro-tech startup, called Neuralink, has gained a lot of public attention. The startup is developing a chip that would be implanted in a person's brain, where it would record the person's neural activity and potentially stimulate it. Synchron also proposes to enable direct brain control of mobility-assistive devices for paralyzed patients using implantable devices.Other startups are developing wearable devices to monitor and regulate brain activity. Thync, for example, has created a small, wearable ""pod"" that attaches to the back of the neck and combats stress while also promoting better sleep. Another company, BrainCo, is working on brain-machine interface wearable headbands for mind-controlled gaming.Startups like Nuralogix are promoting a more convenient approach to neurotechnology. Instead of specialist electronic gadgets, it has developed a smartphone application that uses AI to determine the user's health status. Its app, Anura, will collect a 30-second photo from your phone and produce a data archive covering various aspects of your health, such as heart rate and stress levels.Our MethodologyUsing stock screeners and manual research, we identified the biggest companies operating in the neuroscience space and ranked them in ascending order of their market cap. To accommodate major private companies, we took the average of five publicly traded neuroscience companies in our list to arrive at a revenue multiple of 6.5x, which we then used to estimate private companies' market cap and valuation. It is pertinent to note that our list comprises of both pure-play neuroscience companies and large biotech and pharmaceutical companies that have neuroscience divisions or related products.Biggest Neuroscience Companies in the World15.

Silver averaged $21.77 in 2022.Silver should begin to outperform gold as China's economy reopens and global manufacturing activity recovers, said Bradley Saunders at Capital Economics.""The main risk, though, is that high interest rates in developed markets take a significant toll on demand for interest-sensitive consumer goods, such as electronics, which silver is used in,"" he said.(Reporting by Kavya Guduru in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Hobson and Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

The state last week had planned to issue the expanded order by the end of January, but has faced resistance from miners.The department did not say how many tonnes of coal will be required.Whitehaven Coal Chief Executive Paul Flynn has said the government appeared to be looking to secure around 3 million to 5 million tonnes, but the company was pressing the state to explain how that shortfall estimate had been determined.Directions issued in December required a dozen coal mines that supply power plants in New South Wales to fill a shortfall in supply at a capped price of A$125 a tonne - well below the export price currently at about $265 a tonne - under a deal with the federal government.The mines are mainly owned by Glencore Plc, Peabody Energy, New Hope Corp and Thailand's Banpu PCL .The state now wants to spread the requirement to all the state's coal producers, including those that export all of their output, including BHP Group, Whitehaven Coal and Yancoal Australia.BHP has said the new policy could affect its plan to keep its Mt Arthur coal mine, the state's largest single coal mine, open until 2030.

Study a company’s revenues over a given period, subtract the production cost, and you have earnings. By the way, this is also considered the most important variable influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings play a noteworthy role.Earnings Estimates &amp; Share Price MovementsFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category.

EONGY's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.11. EONGY's P/B has been as high as 1.73 and as low as 0.73, with a median of 1.01, over the past year.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that EONGY has a P/CF ratio of 3.24. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. EONGY's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.48. Within the past 12 months, EONGY's P/CF has been as high as 3.60 and as low as 2.09, with a median of 2.73.Another great Utility - Electric Power stock you could consider is NRG Energy (NRG), which is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of NRG Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.72, and its PEG ratio is 0.56.

The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”17.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

The product will invest in innovation-driven companies, which are considered to be “leading-edge” firms thanks to their intellectual property, ground-breaking as well as advanced products and services that can be disruptive to existing business models.“This is likely to be an aggressive growth ETF — but innovation is a ‘sexier’ name,” said James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence.Still, it’s important to keep in mind that those firms were “absolutely crushed in 2021 and 2022,” he added.

Lower equity prices and greater volatility gave issuers little incentive to sell shares at reduced valuations. The decreased values offered potential sellers' little motivation to pursue M&amp;A transactions and reduced buyers' ability to make acquisitions.""Persistent economic headwinds held back global M&amp;A and IPO activity in 2022 and a sharp turnaround is not expected,"" said Joe Mantone, author of the report and editorial lead, at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Any signs of the Fed loosening monetary policy should benefit M&amp;A and equity issuance. A more dovish stance would likely lead to a rebound in the equity markets and help open up the IPO window, while lower rates would create better conditions for the financing markets.""Key highlights from the quarterly report include:Global deal values in 2022 recorded the second lowest annual totals for M&amp;A announcements since 2013 and lowest totals for equity issuance since at least 2006.The total value of global IPOs fell 71.3% year over year to $179.73 billion in 2022 while the number global IPOs fell 48.7% to 1,671 during the same period.The Asia-Pacific region provided some boost in fourth quarter 2022 dealmaking with a 23.6% quarter-over-quarter increase in the total value of M&amp;A announcements.The quarterly report provides an overview of global M&amp;A and equity issuance trends, offering insights into the sectors and geographies that are seeing the most activity.

158,5e918134-ef74-3eeb-8068-0f509364f790,TSN,2023-01-31,Earnings Preview: Tyson Foods (TSN) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-tyson-foods-tsn-150003421.html,1675090803,STORY,['TSN'],"[Tyson Foods (TSN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis meat producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -49.8%.Revenues are expected to be $13.1 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tyson?For Tyson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -20.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tyson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tyson would post earnings of $1.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.63, delivering a surprise of -4.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tyson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pandemic-driven demand started to reverse. Now tech companies are cutting back expenses and laying off employees. With growth names on the decline, investors have turned to other sectors that are known for being more stable and recession-proof, such as consumer staples stocks.Consumer staples stocks tend to fare well in bear markets. After all, the makers of food, beverages, personal products, and so on tend to hold up regardless of economic conditions. Indeed, many of these defensive stocks greatly outperformed the market in 2022.This might make investors think that the moment for defensive holdings has passed. But that would be a mistake.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn fact, there are still solid values to be had in the consumer staple stocks space. All three of these consumer staples companies have seen their shares decline by 15% or more over the past year, which sets them up for a solid turnaround as things improve in 2023.TickerCompanyPriceMKCMcCormick$73.46TSNTyson Foods$65.49CLXThe Clorox Company$141.88McCormick (MKC)Source: ShutterstockSpices, seasonings, and hot sauces maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) have given long-term investors plenty to cheer about. Shares are up more than 1,200% over the past 30 years.However, the company’s hot streak has worn off; shares have been roughly flat since 2019. Additionally, the stock was off by double-digits in 2022. This pause in the company’s gains could present a solid buying opportunity.In recent years, McCormick has enjoyed tremendous growth due to key acquisitions such as Frank’s hot sauce and Cholula hot sauce. Americans are enamored of spicy flavors, and hot sauces are one of the leading categories within the grocery store. McCormick is leaning heavily into that opportunity.More broadly, McCormick’s core spices and seasoning business is absolutely dominant. The company has a massive market share, ensuring that it maintains outsized profit margins. The company’s institutional business, delivering flavorings for leading restaurants and fast food chains, is another vehicle for growth. Americans want exciting and unique food flavors, and McCormick is there to deliver.Story continuesTyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) had a difficult 2022. The leading meat processing firm was not able to benefit from the rising inflationary environment. This comes because Tyson primarily sells commodity meat products rather than having solid brands, which would allow it to mark up prices considerably.While Tyson’s weaker branded position is a drawback, shares more than reflects that. Tyson stock is down more than 25% over the past year, and shares now sell for just 10 times forward earnings.Some of the declines are likely due to a messy and unfortunate personal behavior scandal committed by Tyson’s chief financial officer. However, while that was a black eye for the company, it shouldn’t have a meaningful impact on the firm’s long-term profitability.With commodity prices starting to normalize, Tyson should see its operations stabilize in 2023. Meanwhile, at such a low starting valuation, shares should have considerable upside once earnings per share start to rise.The Clorox Company (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThe Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is the perfect example of how the pandemic created a massive boom and bust within certain industries. Clorox saw a sharp jump in sales in 2020 as people stocked their pantries with cleaning supplies. Corporate customers also ordered more goods to keep their public surfaces as hygienic as possible.However, while Clorox enjoyed record revenues in 2020, things quickly turned downward. While sales have returned to more normal levels, earnings actually fell well below pre-pandemic levels. This came about due to the inflationary spiral, which has driven up the price of chemicals, labor, packaging materials, and so on.But this, too, shall pass. Analysts expect Clorox to earn just $4.11 per share in 2023. However, it typically earned approximately $6.50 per share in annual earnings before the pandemic. As current headwinds abate, earnings should return to more normal levels and drive a strong upturn in the price of CLX stock. Thus, Clorox is among the top consumer staples stocks to buy this year.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in MKC stock.

However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

US suppliers have since required government approval to sell to the telecom equipment giant.Now, some officials in the Biden administration are advocating for banning all sales to Huawei — long suspected of ties to the Beijing government and Chinese military — as the administration debates whether and how to adjust its licensing policy, according to people familiar with the matter.The people asked not to be identified because a decision hasn’t been made.Tensions with China have been rising throughout Joe Biden’s presidency, and he’s under pressure from Republicans controlling the House to continue squeezing Beijing, particularly to limit the country’s technological advances. Last week, the Biden administration persuaded the Netherlands and Japan to join with the US in restricting exports of advanced semiconductor manufacturing machinery to China.Beijing “is gravely concerned about the report,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Tuesday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.“China is strongly against the US’s abuse of state power to hobble Chinese companies by stretching the concept of national security,” she said, adding the Asian nation would protect its companies without saying how.Story continuesRead more: Biden Wins Deal With Dutch, Japan on China Chip Export CurbsHuawei was once one of the world’s largest buyers of electronic components and a hugely important part of the supply chain because of its position in the handset and networking equipment industries. Trump’s ban on certain sales crippled the Chinese company, while wiping out huge amounts of revenue for US suppliers such as Broadcom Inc.But the Commerce Department continued to allow some other products to be supplied to Huawei. The company remains a $100 billion behemoth that’s spearheading the expansion of the world’s largest 5G network at home, while aiding construction of critical broadband from Africa to the Middle East. In December, the firm declared it was “business as usual” after successfully weathering US tech sanctions.Stalled ApplicationsUnder the new policy some officials advocate, all license requests to supply the company would be denied. Meanwhile, most current applications for new licenses are languishing in a stalled approval process, the people said, creating a de facto halt.The longer-term impact on Huawei from that action is uncertain. It still derives enormous revenue from local wireless carriers such as China Mobile Ltd. and state enterprises that rely on Huawei to build local-level and corporate networks. China operates more than 2 million 5G base stations, or more than 60% of the world’s total, according to industry officials.Huawei’s also been stockpiling foreign components such as chips and sourcing or researching alternatives to American circuitry. Representatives for the company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. provide Huawei with processors it uses in its Mate range of laptops, while Qualcomm sells Huawei processors and modems that are the core components of its diminished range of smartphones.Spokespeople for the National Security Council and the Commerce Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Intel, Qualcomm and AMD declined to comment.It’s not clear how soon the administration may act on a policy change, the people familiar with the matter said. They cautioned that discussions are at an early stage, and some of them said timing for a decision could coincide with the four-year anniversary of Huawei’s addition to the entity list in May.Shutting off sales to Huawei wouldn’t be as devastating for US companies as it once was. The Chinese company has spun off a large chunk of its smartphone business, mostly offers only lower-bandwidth 4G phones under its own name and has seen its brand damaged by the US campaign against it.Underlining the decline in its importance, Huawei represents less than one percent of revenue for Qualcomm, Intel and AMD, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.--With assistance from Gao Yuan and Philip Glamann.(Updates with comment from China’s Foreign Ministry from sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingA 3D Printer Isn’t Cool.

Qualcomm Inc in 2020 received permission to sell 4G smartphone chips to Huawei.A Commerce Department spokesperson said officials ""continually assess our policies and regulations"" but do not comment on talks with specific companies. Huawei and Qualcomm declined to comment. Bloomberg and the Financial Times earlier reported the move.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China opposes the United States abusing an overly broad notion of national security to suppress Chinese firms unreasonably.The move ""goes against the principles of the market economy and rules of international trade and finance, hurts the confidence the international community has in the U.S business environment and is blatant technological hegemony,"" Mao said during a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.One person familiar with the matter said U.S. officials are creating a new formal policy of denial for shipping items to Huawei that would include items below the 5G level, including 4G items, Wifi 6 and 7, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing and cloud items.Another person said the move was expected to reflect the Biden administration's tightening of policy on Huawei over the past year. Licenses for 4G chips that could not be used for 5g, which might have been approved earlier, were being denied, the person said. Toward the end of the Trump administration and early in the Biden administration, officials had still granted licenses for items specific to 4G applications.Story continuesAmerican officials placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in 2019 restricting most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods and technology to the company unless they were granted licenses. Officials continued to tighten the controls to cut off Huawei's ability to buy or design the semiconductor chips that power most of its products.But U.S. officials granted licenses that allowed Huawei to receive some products. For example, suppliers to Huawei got licenses worth $61 billion to sell to the telecoms equipment giant from April through November 2021.In December, Huawei said its overall revenue was about $91.53 billion, down only slightly from 2021 when U.S. sanctions caused its sales to fall by nearly a third.

PM, The Kroger Co. KR, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE, Lyft, Inc. LYFT and Agilent Technologies, Inc. A.5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for Solid Returns in 2023As the year 2022 ended on a grim note, it’s time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for 2023. While the recent economic data point to some effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown this year. The bearish sentiments are leading to huge market volatility, making it difficult for individual investors to pick stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks in the current situation is to follow rating upgrades by brokers. In this regard, stocks like Philip Morris International Inc., The Kroger Co., Expedia Group, Inc., Lyft, Inc. and Agilent Technologies, Inc. are worth a look.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper understanding of what is happening in a particular company. They meticulously assess companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have an extra understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.Hence, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are five of the 31 stocks that qualified for the screening:Story continuesNew York-based Philip Morris manufactures and sells cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products outside the United States.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

(NYSE: PHM) announced today financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. Adjusted net income for the period was $832 million, or $3.63 per share. Adjusted net income excludes a $65 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves and a $49 million pre-tax gain in JV income relating to the sale of commercial property, partially offset by a $31 million pre-tax charge associated with the Company’s decision to exit certain land-option agreements and a tax charge of $12 million from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments. Prior year reported net income was $663 million, or $2.61 per share. Adjusted net income for that period was $637 million, or $2.51 per share, after excluding a $23 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves and a tax benefit of $9 million from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments.""Within a rapidly evolving housing market, our organization remains focused on driving operational performance, ensuring an appropriate cadence of production, and intelligently managing our balance sheet,"" said Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup President and CEO. ""Consistent with this focus, our fourth quarter results show closings up 3%, with a 200-basis point increase in gross margin and a 48% increase in earnings per share. Our strong fourth quarter results allowed PulteGroup to lower its debt-to-capital ratio to 18.7% and deliver a full year return on equity of 32.9%*.""Story continuesMr. Marshall continued, ""While demographics, supply dynamics and the overall financial benefits of home ownership keep us confident about long-term demand, Federal Reserve actions to fight inflation through higher interest rates continued to impact homebuying demand in the quarter. Given these conditions, we are managing our house and land inventory to efficiently turn our assets and maximize returns, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return funds to our shareholders.""Fourth Quarter ResultsFor the fourth quarter, home sale revenues increased 20% over the prior year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes, in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000.The Company’s fourth quarter home sale gross margin of 28.8%, which is an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year, reflects the strong demand and pricing environment that existed in first half of 2022. The Company’s reported fourth quarter SG&amp;A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes the $65 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, adjusted SG&amp;A expense for the quarter was $416 million, or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In the prior year fourth quarter, the Company’s reported SG&amp;A expense of $344 million, or 8.2% of home sale revenues, included a $23 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, the Company’s adjusted SG&amp;A expense was $367 million, or 8.7% of home sale revenues.Net new orders for the fourth quarter totaled 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the prior year. In addition to more challenging demand conditions resulting from Federal Reserve actions to raise rates, signups in the quarter reflect elevated cancellation rates which increased to 32% in the quarter, up from 11% in the prior year. The value of net new orders in the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion, compared with $3.8 billion last year. Average community count for the fourth quarter increased 8% from the prior year to 850 communities. Unit backlog at the end of the quarter was 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion.Fourth quarter pre-tax income for the Company’s Financial Services operations was $24 million, down from $55 million in the prior year. The decrease in pre-tax income for the period reflects both a reduction in loan volumes and the more competitive pricing environment that existed for much of 2022. Lower loan volumes for the period were driven by a decline in capture rate to 75% compared with 85% in the comparable prior year period.The Company repurchased 2.4 million of its common shares in the fourth quarter for $100 million, or an average price of $41.81 per share. In 2022, the Company repurchased 24.2 million common shares for $1.1 billion, or an average price of $44.48 per share. The 24.2 million common shares repurchased represent approximately 9.7% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2022.At year end, the Company’s debt-to-total capital ratio was 18.7%, down from 21.3% last year. Adjusting for the $1.1 billion of cash on hand at the end of the period, the Company’s net debt-to-total capital ratio was 9.6%.A conference call discussing PulteGroup's fourth quarter 2022 results is scheduled for Tuesday, January 31, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested investors can access the live webcast via PulteGroup's corporate website at www.pultegroup.com.* The Company's return on equity is calculated as net income for the trailing twelve months divided by average shareholders' equity, where average shareholders' equity is the sum of ending shareholders' equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release includes ""forward-looking statements.""

Take a look at three REITs that have recently received multiple analyst downgrades but still managed to show positive results this month:Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE: CCI) is a Houston-based specialized REIT that focuses on owning, operating and leasing cell towers. Crown Castle was founded in 1994 with a portfolio of 133 cell towers. Today, the REIT has over 40,000 towers and 85,000 miles of fiber in its portfolio.One negative for Crown Castle is its forward annual dividend of $6.26 per share against funds from operations (FFO) of $7.76, producing a payout ratio of 80%.On Jan. 23, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel downgraded Crown Castle from Overweight to Sector Weight. No price target was given.A few weeks ago, Barclays analyst Brendan Lynch also downgraded Crown Castle, from Overweight to Equal Weight, while lowering his price target from $153 to $152. From the recent closing price of $146.07, that still represents a potential increase of 4%.But the analyst news wasn’t all bad this month for Crown Castle, as three other analysts have maintained Outperform or Buy ratings within the past two weeks. Three analysts have price targets between $152 and $154, and one has a price target of $175.Despite the downgrades, Crown Castle has risen 5.61% since the beginning of the year.Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE: EXR) is a Salt Lake City-based self-storage REIT with over 2,000 locations in large metropolitan areas across 41 states and Washington, D.C. Extra Space Storage was founded in 1977 and is the second-largest operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. Over the past five years, it has acquired $4.6 billion worth of new properties.Extra Space Storage’s performance history is excellent. Since August 2004, Extra Space Storage’s average annual total return is 16.09%. Over the last five years, Extra Space Storage has also grown its quarterly dividend from $0.78 to $1.50 per share, an increase of 92%. The annual yield of $6 per share on its recent closing price of $157.59 was 3.8%.Story continuesDespite this, on Jan. 18, Wolfe Research analyst Andrew Rosivach downgraded Extra Space Storage from Outperform to Peer Perform. No price target was given. The downgrade was a valuation call.One day earlier, Truist Securities analyst Ki Bin Kim downgraded Extra Space Storage from Buy to Hold, while lowering the price target from $175 to $160. With a recent closing price of $157.59, that represents only a 1.53% potential increase from the present level.Earlier this month, Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes expressed a different view, upgrading Extra Space Storage from Market Perform to Outperform while announcing a $170 price target.Investors have shrugged off the downgrades, and Extra Space Storage has risen 9.22% this month.Kimco Realty Corp. (NYSE: KIM) is a Jericho, New York-based retail REIT that owns and operates 526 open-air, grocery store-anchored properties with 91 million square feet of leasable space. Kimco Realty is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1991.Kimco Realty received three downgrades this month. On Jan. 17, Truist Securities analyst Kim downgraded Kimco Realty from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $25 to $24.On Jan. 10, Mizuho Securities analyst Haendel St. Juste downgraded Kimco Realty from Buy to Neutral and dropped the price target from $22 to $21. St. Juste’s reasons were that Kimco Realty is at full valuation with minimal earnings growth.This downgrade came a day after Credit Suisse analyst Omotayo Okusanya downgraded Kimco Realty from Outperform to Neutral and announced a price target of $22. At a recent closing price of $22.65, these three price targets represent a potential range from negative 7.28% to positive 5.96%.But are these downgrades deserved? Kimco Realty’s third-quarter operating results beat the street on FFO and revenue. The quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share was raised to $0.23 per share in December, the sixth increase since the 2020 COVID-related dividend cut. The forward FFO payout is still reasonable at 58%.Kimco Realty shares have risen 6.64% in January.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Defensive stocks are favored by investors during tough economic times as companies operating in the space feel little impact of the broader economic downturn. That’s because they sell products and services whose demand remains almost unchanged due to their essential nature. Defensive sectors include consumers staples, healthcare and utilities, among others. As of December 29, the S&amp;P 500 utility stocks as a whole fell 0.5% in 2022, while consumer staples were down 2.7% in the period. Compare this performance to the broader market (SPY) decline of about 20% and you begin to understand why everyone wants to invest in undervalued defensive stocks when things go south.Smart investors are continuing to prefer defensive stocks in 2023 as the economic outlook for this year paints no rosy picture. According a Wall Street Journal report, Lisa Erickson, head of the public markets group at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, believes the starting months of this year would continue to pose challenges. That’s why the investor reportedly said she is recommending dividend-paying defensive stocks to her clients.“We’ve had a perfect setup for defensive companies… With that type of volatility expected again, companies that can provide more of a cash-flow buffer in their returns look attractive,” Erickson reportedly said.Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify stocks with PE ratios less than 20 in the following three defensive sectors: consumer staples, healthcare and utilities. From the resultant dataset, we chose 15 stocks that had the most number of hedge funds invested in them.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs.

COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned +12.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which Mosaic falls in, has gained 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +126%. This estimate has changed -9.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.96 indicates a change of -21.3% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Mosaic is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate of $4.31 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.1%. The $18.95 billion and $16.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +53.4% and -13.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.5%. EPS of $3.22 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -11.01%. The EPS surprise was -8.52%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Mosaic. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The smaller 737 will slot into a bay currently used for some remaining 787 work.Boeing said on Monday it would add a new 737 MAX production line in Everett in mid-2024, complementing three already in place at the Renton plant, 36 miles to the south.That comes as Airbus is mid-way through installing a new production line for its hot-selling A321neo narrow-body jet in the deserted Lagardere building. It has also announced plans to expand a plant in Alabama.Once exclusively serving as fortresses in an economic war over big twin-aisle jets, the colossal plants will become an industrial beehive for profitable single-aisle models, reflecting a surge of demand for short and medium trips.Analysts said Boeing's move signalled confidence in demand including from China, despite recent trade tensions.But they noted both sites will still have spare capacity as future production strategy and automation move centre-stage in the jet market duopoly, ahead of new orders or jet designs.""At this stage in the industry evolution, with no new programme starts in the near future, production strategy is coming to the fore,"" said aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group.Story continues'STATEMENT' TO AIRBUS AND INVESTORSAirbus and Boeing were for years evenly matched in the single-aisle market which generates most cash. But Airbus pulled sharply ahead due to strong sales of the A321neo and a safety crisis over the 737 MAX, from which Boeing is just recovering.Boeing aims initially to boost monthly single-aisle output to 50 from 30, and Airbus wants to go as high as 75 from about 45, though analysts question how quickly this can be done.But narrowing the gap is crucial to preserving Boeing's main cash cow and strengthening the platform for future launches.""(Boeing) don't want to be in a situation where Airbus moves to 70 and they are stuck at 50. They want to have the possibility of matching what Airbus does,"" said economist Adam Pilarski, senior vice-president at consultancy AVITAS.""So this is a very important statement (to Airbus): 'We are not going to withdraw from the market',"" he added.Boeing declined to elaborate on Monday's announcement. Airbus declined to comment.Boeing's move is also seen as a bid to reinforce its appeal to investors, some of whom have voiced fears that it is drifting after Chief Executive Dave Calhoun ruled out launching a new plane within the next decade - even though many analysts agree it makes financial and technological sense to wait.""This is Calhoun's way of signalling: don't count us out, we're in this for the long haul,"" Lundquist said.Boeing has not said how the line would be designed but both companies are expected to seize on the chance to test the latest automation in part of the market where unit costs are critical.(Additional reporting by Valerie Insinna, David Shepardson; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Built in 1967 to produce the mammoth jet, it remains the world's largest manufacturing plant according to Boeing.But after five decades, customer demand for the 747 eroded as Boeing and Airbus developed more fuel efficient two-engine widebody planes. When Boeing confirmed in July 2020 that it would end 747 production, it was already only producing at a rate of half an aircraft a month.Boeing delivered five 747s in 2022, while in 1990, the peak delivery year of the bestselling 747-400 version, Boeing delivered 70 747s.Story continuesAs different sections of the last 747 – the wings or fuselage structures, for example – were complete, the production line ""just slowly started to shut down,"" said Kim Smith, Boeing's vice president and general manager for the 747 and 767 programs.Smith said all 747 program workers were transferred to other jobs or voluntarily retired.The last 747 rolled out on Dec. 7, capping the program at 1,574 total. The plane has since completed inspections and flight tests, flying to Portland over the holidays to get a paint job. The plane will fly off on Wednesday morning to Atlas’ headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio.While Boeing also builds the 767 and 777 in Everett, the company has yet to decide which program will permanently take over the 747 production bay, which is currently being used for 787 inventory and 777X work, Smith said.Boeing will remain tied to the 747 through the aftermarket business and the Air Force One replacement program, which Boeing won in 2018.The heir apparent to the 747, the 777X will not be ready for delivery until 2025, but Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun focused his goodbye on that future: “The 777, the next plane to dominate this space, displaced all its competition just like that - and we haven’t even introduced the best version.”(Reporting by Valerie Insinna; additional reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

It was disclosed on the eve of the final delivery of the iconic 747 from the plant.The 737 line will take the place of some remaining activity on the 787, a modern wide-body jet whose production has been concentrated at another Boeing plant in South Carolina.Boeing said this month it had stabilized 737 production at 31 per month, with plans to ramp production up to approximately 50 per month in the 2025-2026 timeframe.UNION SUPPORTDeal referred to a decision of Congress in December to lift a deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of the 737 MAX aircraft.The planemaker had been heavily lobbying for months to persuade lawmakers to waive the deadline covering the MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes, imposed by Congress in 2020 after two 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.Boeing had said the fate of the two new planes was in jeopardy without action from Congress.Story continuesDeal's email cited the support of unions for the waiver, including the International Association of Machinists (IAM).Earlier this month, IAM International President Robert Martinez said the union ""relentlessly fought for this extension that will ensure the livelihoods of thousands of machinists in the aerospace sector.""The legislation requires Boeing to fit new safety enhancements to the MAX 7 and MAX 10 and retrofit existing MAX 8 and MAX 9 planes in the fleet. Boeing said the costs of the retrofits will be ""small.""Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said this month the company thinks ""first delivery for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 the next year.""Airline executives including United Chief Executive Scott Kirby and employee unions had raised concerns that a failure of Congress to act would have impacted U.S. jobs at Boeing.Officials have credited airline unions with helping convince Congress to approve the waiver over the objection of some relatives of those killed in the 737 MAX crashes.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Seattle and David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Mark Porter and Nick Zieminski)]"

Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) has a market capitalization of $94.889 billion.Baron Funds made the following comment about Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We initiated a position in Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), a health services organization with two primary segments, Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. Cigna Healthcare provides health insurance products, including a business in which Cigna provides administrative services only to plan sponsors (employers, unions, and other groups). Evernorth provides a portfolio of health care services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services, care delivery services, data and analytics solutions, and distribution of specialty drugs. Each segment has a portion of business that provides steady, predictable growth. These foundational businesses, which account for roughly 60% of total revenue, include the U.S. commercial business, the PBM business, and international. The other 40% of revenue comes from higher-growth businesses, including the specialty pharmacy business, care delivery services, and Medicare Advantage. Management targets 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the long term. The stock trades at a significant discount to industry peers because of the company’s commercial health insurance and PBM business mix. We think the PBM business will benefit from the biosimilar wave in the next few years, and as Cigna’s higher growth businesses become a bigger percentage of the overall mix, we think the stock can appreciate at least in line with its annual EPS growth with potential for valuation expansion.”Story continueseasiest countries to get oxycodone prescribedpikselstock/Shutterstock.comCigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

You can skip this part and go to 5 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.The stock market crash of 2022 plunged US equities to new lows. While it has ushered in a chaos in the markets, long-term investors are seeing it as an opportunity to pile into undervalued stocks with strong upside potential. In October last year, Finance Professor at the University of Pennsylvania Jeremy Siegel said that stocks were “undervalued greatly” in the long run. He said at the time that rising interest rates were keeping a lid on the stocks but said the rates were not expected to remain elevated for a long time.“I’m staying put, I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if a year, year and half from now we’re 20-30% higher. I think stocks are undervalued greatly in the long-run.”Siegel also noted that sooner or later inflation will be tamed and the Federal Reserve will not continue its strong rates hikes. In 2023, many analysts are expecting the Federal Reserve to slow and eventually halt rate hikes.However, the overall outlook for the economy is not too optimistic. According to Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson corporate profit estimates are still too high. The analyst said in a note to investors earlier in January that the equity risk premium is at its lowest since the run-up to 2008. That’s why Wilson believes the S&amp;P 500 could fall much lower than the 3,500 to 3,600 points the market is currently estimating in the event of a mild recession.Despite the short-term headwinds and recession warnings, wise investors know that sooner or later the markets will turn around. When they do, only those investors will turn out to be the winners who’d invested when everyone was selling. Financial analysts at Morningstar said in a report published in September 2022 that the market was offering a huge discount as it had plunged to record lows seen only in rare instances.Story continues“While near-term conditions may pressure earnings in the short term, at current valuations we think the market has fallen more than enough to incorporate those headwinds. In our view, we think the market is overly pessimistic regarding the long-term prospects for equity valuations .”While these optimistic comments don’t look much prescient in hindsight, they’ll hold weight when seen with a long-term outlook.Photo by Chris Liverani on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds’ holdings and picked the top 11 blue chip stocks with PE ratios less than 15.

We like the company’s track record of innovation, and its diversified portfolio of drugs. However, we’ve become increasingly concerned about the outlook for some of its recently launched therapeutics, as well as some generic competition in a few of its mature drugs. If pressed, we still like the odds that Novartis will do well, but the outlook is a little cloudier than it’s been in a while. As noted above, we’ve been big fans of its Alcon unit for many years, and now that Alcon is independent, we decided to concentrate our investment there.”9.

CVX is a leading integrated oil company with exploration, production, and refining operations. It is the second largest oil company in the United States with more than 70% of production volumes from oil and liquid-linked natural gas. We believe it has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its scale and low-cost position. It has a large acreage position in the Permian Basin, which is a high-quality oil field. CVX was an early mover in the Permian and did not overpay to enter the oilfield; 75% of its position has a no or low royalty rate, which gives it a cost advantage over competitors.Our thesis is that free cash flow growth per share is expected to accelerate due to disciplined capital spending, rising Permian production volumes, and stock repurchases. The company has also made important investments in low-carbon areas like greenhouse gas reduction, carbon capture, hydrogen, and renewable fuels which we believe will pay off later in the decade as the world transitions more to renewable energy sources…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

This one-hour show would be Ms. Barr’s first return to a stand-up comedy special in almost 20 years.The show would present anecdotes on a variety of topics from her life like her experiences while growing up in the Mormon citadel of Salt Lake City, moving to Texas, and raising her children.Roseanne is considered a comedy icon in America. Her extraordinary career spanning decades has won her four Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and a prestigious Peabody Award for her sitcom Roseanne, which aired on ABC. Her performance on this show is expected to receive much appreciation from the viewers and boost viewership at Fox Nation.In addition to this, FOX Nation will also release Who Is Roseanne Barr?, which will give an insight into the life and career of Ms. Barr and let fans know her better.Fox Nation to Boost the Company’s Top LineFox Nation has been witnessing growth lately. Its subscriptions and total hours watched recorded an increase of 45% and 70% year over year, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2023. This could be attributed to the strengthening of Fox Nation’s pipeline with original content such as Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back and Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner, which is gaining traction.Along with this, Fox Nation has also kicked off 2023 with exciting slates such as Trapped: A Nancy Grace Investigation, which features Nancy Grace exposing how big stars across the world find themselves trapped in a dark system filled with alleged exploitation and abuse.The streaming platform has also released Who is Meghan and Harry?, which discusses in detail the relationship of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle whose marriage received criticism from the British Royal family.This content could draw more viewership to Fox Nation and further aid its subscriptions, which will ultimately boost Fox Corp’s top line.However, the growth in Fox Nation could be offset by the deteriorating performances of other business divisions of Fox such as Fox Business Network, whose viewership slumped from 180,000 in 2021 to 134,000 in 2022.Story continuesFox Corporation Price and Consensus Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation Quote Fox News Digital has also shown disappointing results as its multiplatform views, multiplatform minutes and monthly multiplatform unique visitors for 2022 declined by 10%, 17% and 12%, respectively.This is primarily due to the ongoing cord-cutting that is expected to intensify in the future, hence creating a prolonged headwind for the company.Shares of Fox have declined 16.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector, which fell 17.7% in the same time frame. Zack Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderFox currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Manchester United MANU, Stride LRN and Liberty Global LBTYA, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Shares of Manchester United have gained 71% in the past year.

Some apps even change the way people bank. One of the leading options, PayPal, has 429 million users in America — according to Zippia — and has recorded revenue increases each year since 2010, per Business of Apps. That includes $25.3 billion revenue in 2021 alone, earned via 19 billion transactions amounting to $1.2 trillion in total transaction volume.See: Here’s How Much Americans Have in Their Savings Accounts in 2023Read: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The Future of Finances: Gen Z &amp; How They Relate to MoneyThough it’s a convenient way to pay for goods and transfer money, is it better than a traditional bank?According to retail and fintech analysis site PYMNTS, “PayPal remains the money-storing app to beat for banks” as financial apps go more mainstream. They provide data to support the claim, noting that 59% of customers have utilized platforms like PayPal for “general-purpose or merchant-specific payments” over the past year. Additionally, PYMNTS reported that “37% of customers who have stored money in any app in the past year have exclusively done so with general-purpose apps.”The article also cited a survey finding that PayPal leads the pack regarding which option respondents trust most for storing their money — coming in at 84.5% versus 59% for a primary bank and the 48.6% who chose Apple Pay.Most of the interest stems from younger bankers who look to mobile options for more real-time accessibility, personalization, advanced services and money-saving options. Though there are still many people that are hesitant to make a full switch to mobile banking due to the loss of in-person interactivity at branch locations.Here are some pros and cons when it comes to personal banking with an app like PayPal.Pros of Banking With PayPalTraditional Banking Options: In addition to using PayPal as a transaction option, you can also apply for a PayPal credit card, use the mobile app to access money 24/7 as well as take advantage of other features similar to the traditional banking experience.Story continuesSecurity: If you use PayPal for transactions, you don’t have to provide your personal banking information, offering an extra level of security against fraud.Multiple Payment Options: Unlike a bank where you use money in your savings or checking accounts for payments, PayPal allows you to carry a specific PayPal balance, link existing savings or checking accounts — or use credit cards to pay for services.Discounts: By using PayPal as a payment option, some merchants will provide a promotion. For example, as of Jan. 30, TurboTax is offering $10 off when using PayPal to fulfill payment for services. Further, Macy’s, Ulta and other retailers are offering cash back for purchases made via PayPal.Rewards Program: PayPal recently introduced PayPal Rewards, awarding points for every purchase.Buy Now, Pay Later: When using PayPal to pay for goods, you’re able to split up the payments into monthly or weekly options until the total amount is paid off.International transactions: PayPal is available globally and offers the chance to pay for goods in another country while also converting the currency for the recipient or merchant.Take Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?More: 12 Best Games That Pay Real Money in 2023 — PayPal and CashCons of Banking With PayPalBranch Locations: PayPal is a fully mobile experience so there’s no branch locations or tellers you can speak with when you need customer service. Of course, PayPal does have an online “help” option, as well a customer service help line.Interest: The great part about a traditional bank is the interest earned on savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit, neither of which are opportunities PayPal offers.Insurance: Unlike traditional banks that are FDIC-insured for up to $250,000 per account per bank, PayPal does not carry this type of protection.ATMs: If you want physical paper cash, you can’t do that with PayPal.Auto Loans and Mortgages: Though you can get a line of credit through PayPal, PayPal does not offer financing options like auto loans or mortgages.More From GOBankingRates5 Best Southern Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a MonthExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 2023How To Save Money When Filing TaxesThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Is PayPal a Better Option Than a Traditional Bank?]"

Furthermore, its strength in high-power RF applications is likely to have been a tailwind.The company is also likely to have benefited from its strengthening RF subsystems and module design capabilities for IND applications.However, supply-chain disruptions led by the coronavirus pandemic are likely to have continued impacting the company’s financial performance during the fiscal first quarter negatively.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MTSI this time around.

You can skip this part and go to 5 Best Performing Cybersecurity Stocks in 2022.Increasing number of cyber attacks are keeping governments and companies over the world on their toes. As companies move their digital assets to Cloud platforms, their anxiety around the security of their data is increasing. That’s why cybersecurity companies are continuing to see an increasing demand of their products from government and private sectors. According to a Bloomberg report published in November, Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at Spear Invest, said that security is usually the last area to see budget cuts in the enterprise sector. That’s why the analyst thinks the cybersecurity domain is expected to keep growing despite recession fears.“This constant underpinning of demand makes security a very attractive space, which is why people are getting in even though there’s so much uncertainty everywhere else,” Delevska reportedly said.Cybersecurity's ResilienceThe Bloomberg report mentioned a Morgan Stanley survey which sheds light on the resilience of the cybersecurity sector. Morgan Stanley’s quarterly survey showed that the demand in the broader software sector was slowing amid recession fears. However, according to the survey, top software executives said security was a top priority.The Bloomberg report also said that stocks in the cybersecurity group looked cheaper than the broader software sector. The security index, back in November when the report was published, was trading at 26 times estimated earnings and 1.3 times sales. The broader software sector index showed these reading at 28 and 5.7, respectively.Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president of First Trust Portfolios, according to the Bloomberg report, thinks the cybersecurity sector remains strong because cyber criminals are operating in a space that is not tied to the broader economy.Story continuesIn an interview with BNN Bloomberg, Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights, said that as companies move to Cloud, security remains the main focus of their attention. He said that Cloud security is becoming one of the biggest themes of the cybersecurity market. He also talked about the mergers and acquisitions activity taking place in the industry and talked about some notable companies, including Cisco, Zscaler and Qualys Inc.Photo by Kaur Kristjan on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we scanned different ETFs tracking cybersecurity stocks and picked the most notable cybersecurity stocks that outperformed the broader markets in 2022.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while IBM has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HPE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than IBM has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.01, while IBM has a forward P/E of 14.21. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 1.85. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.48.Another notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.04. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, IBM has a P/B of 5.52.Based on these metrics and many more, HPE holds a Value grade of A, while IBM has a Value grade of C.Story continuesHPE sticks out from IBM in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that HPE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 3.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 points to a change of +3.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 indicates a change of +4.7% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The $61.83 billion and $64.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.1% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Segment adjusted EBITDA excludes refining planned turnaround costs, which totaled $442 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $204 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA was driven by higher R&amp;M margins.R&amp;M margin was $28.82 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2022, versus $15.88 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2021. Crude capacity utilization was approximately 94%, resulting in total throughput of 2.9 million barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2022, which is roughly flat year-over-year.Refining operating costs per barrel were $5.62 for the fourth quarter of 2022, versus $5.36 for the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of this increase was primarily driven by higher energy costs, project expense associated with higher turnaround activity, as well as a special compensation expense.MidstreamSegment adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, versus $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 as higher pipeline tariff rates and contributions from joint ventures were offset largely by higher project related expenses, lower natural gas liquids prices, and a special compensation expense.Corporate and Items Not AllocatedCorporate expenses totaled $259 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $173 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The variance was primarily driven by retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods and special compensation expenses. The company will continue to pursue recovery of these tax assessments.Speedway This business was sold on May 14, 2021.

MPC may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases, tender offers or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Strategic and Operations UpdateMPC's standalone capital spending outlook for 2023 is $1.3 billion.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Marathon Petroleum is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MPC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.56 per share for MPC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MPC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.31% heading into earnings season.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Petroleum Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

It gives Lithium Americas a major partner as it tries to develop North America's largest lithium mine, which is mired in a long-running court case.Shares of Lithium Americas rose more than 14% to close Monday at $25.23. Shares of GM, which on Tuesday unveiled a robust earnings forecast for the year, rose 8.4%.In a speech to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, Senator Joe Manchin called the GM investment in Lithium Americas ""exciting"" and a ""tangible result"" of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year.Lithium Americas aims to extract lithium at Thacker Pass from a large clay deposit, something that has never been done before at commercial scale. The investment marks the second in as many years by the auto giant into novel lithium processes. GM signed a supply deal in 2021 with Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd, which is trying to filter lithium from geothermal brines in California.GM would supplant China's Ganfeng Lithium to become Lithium Americas' largest shareholder. GM has also agreed to buy all the lithium from Thacker Pass when it opens in 2026 - roughly 40,000 tonnes per year.The deal was in the works for nearly a year and came after rival U.S. lithium companies ioneer Ltd signd a deal to supply Ford Motor Co and Piedmont Lithium Inc inked a pact to supply Tesla Inc .""We wanted the right and holistic parter, rather than a bunch of offtake agreements,"" Jon Evans, the Lithium Americas chief executive, said in an interview.

It gives Lithium Americas a major partner as it tries to develop North America's largest lithium mine, which is mired in a long-running court case.Shares of Lithium Americas rose more than 14% to close Monday at $25.23. Shares of GM, which on Tuesday unveiled a robust earnings forecast for the year, rose 8.4%.In a speech to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, Senator Joe Manchin called the GM investment in Lithium Americas ""exciting"" and a ""tangible result"" of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year.Lithium Americas aims to extract lithium at Thacker Pass from a large clay deposit, something that has never been done before at commercial scale. The investment marks the second in as many years by the auto giant into novel lithium processes. GM signed a supply deal in 2021 with Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd, which is trying to filter lithium from geothermal brines in California.GM would supplant China's Ganfeng Lithium to become Lithium Americas' largest shareholder. GM has also agreed to buy all the lithium from Thacker Pass when it opens in 2026 - roughly 40,000 tonnes per year.The deal was in the works for nearly a year and came after rival U.S. lithium companies ioneer Ltd signd a deal to supply Ford Motor Co and Piedmont Lithium Inc inked a pact to supply Tesla Inc.""We wanted the right and holistic parter, rather than a bunch of offtake agreements,"" Jon Evans, the Lithium Americas chief executive, said in an interview.

Pandemic-driven demand started to reverse. Now tech companies are cutting back expenses and laying off employees. With growth names on the decline, investors have turned to other sectors that are known for being more stable and recession-proof, such as consumer staples stocks.Consumer staples stocks tend to fare well in bear markets. After all, the makers of food, beverages, personal products, and so on tend to hold up regardless of economic conditions. Indeed, many of these defensive stocks greatly outperformed the market in 2022.This might make investors think that the moment for defensive holdings has passed. But that would be a mistake.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn fact, there are still solid values to be had in the consumer staple stocks space. All three of these consumer staples companies have seen their shares decline by 15% or more over the past year, which sets them up for a solid turnaround as things improve in 2023.TickerCompanyPriceMKCMcCormick$73.46TSNTyson Foods$65.49CLXThe Clorox Company$141.88McCormick (MKC)Source: ShutterstockSpices, seasonings, and hot sauces maker McCormick (NYSE:MKC) have given long-term investors plenty to cheer about. Shares are up more than 1,200% over the past 30 years.However, the company’s hot streak has worn off; shares have been roughly flat since 2019. Additionally, the stock was off by double-digits in 2022. This pause in the company’s gains could present a solid buying opportunity.In recent years, McCormick has enjoyed tremendous growth due to key acquisitions such as Frank’s hot sauce and Cholula hot sauce. Americans are enamored of spicy flavors, and hot sauces are one of the leading categories within the grocery store. McCormick is leaning heavily into that opportunity.More broadly, McCormick’s core spices and seasoning business is absolutely dominant. The company has a massive market share, ensuring that it maintains outsized profit margins. The company’s institutional business, delivering flavorings for leading restaurants and fast food chains, is another vehicle for growth. Americans want exciting and unique food flavors, and McCormick is there to deliver.Story continuesTyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) had a difficult 2022. The leading meat processing firm was not able to benefit from the rising inflationary environment. This comes because Tyson primarily sells commodity meat products rather than having solid brands, which would allow it to mark up prices considerably.While Tyson’s weaker branded position is a drawback, shares more than reflects that. Tyson stock is down more than 25% over the past year, and shares now sell for just 10 times forward earnings.Some of the declines are likely due to a messy and unfortunate personal behavior scandal committed by Tyson’s chief financial officer. However, while that was a black eye for the company, it shouldn’t have a meaningful impact on the firm’s long-term profitability.With commodity prices starting to normalize, Tyson should see its operations stabilize in 2023. Meanwhile, at such a low starting valuation, shares should have considerable upside once earnings per share start to rise.The Clorox Company (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThe Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is the perfect example of how the pandemic created a massive boom and bust within certain industries. Clorox saw a sharp jump in sales in 2020 as people stocked their pantries with cleaning supplies. Corporate customers also ordered more goods to keep their public surfaces as hygienic as possible.However, while Clorox enjoyed record revenues in 2020, things quickly turned downward. While sales have returned to more normal levels, earnings actually fell well below pre-pandemic levels. This came about due to the inflationary spiral, which has driven up the price of chemicals, labor, packaging materials, and so on.But this, too, shall pass. Analysts expect Clorox to earn just $4.11 per share in 2023. However, it typically earned approximately $6.50 per share in annual earnings before the pandemic. As current headwinds abate, earnings should return to more normal levels and drive a strong upturn in the price of CLX stock. Thus, Clorox is among the top consumer staples stocks to buy this year.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in MKC stock.

These companies have healthy balance sheets and have shown compelling performance over the years. Amid the current inflationary pressures, investors are considering dividend growers as these companies have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns.According to a report by Nuveen, an American asset management company, dividends have been a significant component of total returns of the stock market over the past few decades. During the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 43%, and 72% of the market’s overall return, respectively. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed the market with less risk from 1973 to 2021. Various other studies also revealed that dividend growers have been a reliable source of regular income for shareholders in the past. From December 1999 to June 2019, the S&amp;P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats generated a total return of 590.3%, with dividends accounting for 57% of the total returns, according to a report by S&amp;P Global.Lord Abbett also highlighted the importance of dividend growers in one of its reports.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

Consider Navient (NAVI),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-fast-paced-momentum-stock-135001347.html,1675086601,STORY,['NAVI'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Navient (NAVI) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 13%, the stock of this student loan servicing company is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. NAVI meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 24.5% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for NAVI is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.52. This indicates that the stock moves 52% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that NAVI has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped NAVI earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, NAVI is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. NAVI is currently trading at 0.66 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 66 cents for each dollar of sales.So, NAVI appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to NAVI, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs US equity strategy chief David Kostin noted in the beginning of November that despite Q3 GDP exceeding expectations, the US economy still appears to be headed towards a recession. During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs. Some firms that are aggressively buying back shares according to Goldman Sachs include Lowe's Companies, Inc.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada. The company operates through Allstate Protection, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Run-off Property-Liability segments.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.Al Kelly: Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus three years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4. International volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus three years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points.Story continuesTravel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup. Processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands.And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continue to develop and expand our global value-added services globally. Now let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap.In the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their cash rewards, travel rewards, premium rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers. Second, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance.Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank. In Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de PanamÃ¡. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa-Tigo Money Access Card.Another strategic fintech deal was with Niyo in India, a fast-growing cross-border focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's five regions. As you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brand globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with three important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide.This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club. Second, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together seven Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform. Also, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million.So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future. On to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across six currency payers with more currencies to come.We also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money, bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct. We are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech, GoHenry.As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the UK, with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future. In addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for business.Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet. On the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by BILL, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks.Third, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping, among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers. Fleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa Open Loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from three European markets to 10.In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a five-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa Fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs. B2B is an active space for fintechs and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards.In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago. Now moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all three areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last three years.In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment. Another area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients. In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource Payment Gateway and Risk Platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space. On extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence.Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions, led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically, CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions. Other value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America.This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduce the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds. And Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's Money Manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers.In conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continue to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments. We will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman.Credit card, Bank, PaymentPhoto by CardMapr.nl on UnsplashI'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa, in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who helped make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016. Ryan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side-by-side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless. With that in mind, and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&amp;A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond.Vasant Prabhu: Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%, non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated. A few key highlights.In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019. E-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic.Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Indexed to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. New plans -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74.Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends. Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year, and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. In level to 2019, debit grew 55% withstanding significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019.E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered. On the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw, all through FY '22, growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the UK. Ex UK, Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the UK remained stable. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019.Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019.The cross-border travel, excluding Europe, indexed to 2019 went from in September to in December. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s indexed to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel indexed to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continues to be strong in the low 140s indexed to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar.Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup. Finally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained and restrictions are lifted in some corridors.The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%.International transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter. Revenue growth was robust across our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions.New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth. GAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected, primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter, as well as G&amp;A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions.Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP non-operating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99, non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5-point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first three weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%.Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020. We are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions.Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transaction growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're resuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter, ex Russia and crypto.The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation. Discontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly two quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points.When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis i.e., adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 points to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth.Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 points to 3 points, with a further 2 point to 3 point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP non-operating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances. Our tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%. As we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories.In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to. Our business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business. Before I finish, this is a sad day for me personally.

Silver averaged $21.77 in 2022.Silver should begin to outperform gold as China's economy reopens and global manufacturing activity recovers, said Bradley Saunders at Capital Economics.""The main risk, though, is that high interest rates in developed markets take a significant toll on demand for interest-sensitive consumer goods, such as electronics, which silver is used in,"" he said.(Reporting by Kavya Guduru in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Hobson and Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

The consensus mark has moved down 1% in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, indicating a rise of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s actuals.We expect the company’s fourth-quarter total revenues to increase 3.8% year over year to $1.15 billion and the bottom line to decrease 4% to $3.94 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 10.1%. SNA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.8%, on average.Snap-On Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseSnap-On Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteKey Factors to NoteSnap-on has been gaining from continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan. The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers, and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.It has been on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs. Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from the continuous productivity and process improvement plans.Management has been boosting customer services, and enhancing manufacturing and supply chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments. All the aforesaid factors should have contributed to the company’s top and bottom-line performances in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Snap-on has been reeling under supply-chain headwinds, which is likely to have hurt fourth-quarter performance. Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses and increased transportation costs, is expected to have been concerning. Unfavorable foreign currency movement is anticipated to have acted as a deterrent.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Snap-on this time around.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Investors began to pile into value stocks in 2022 as financial markets wavered amid rising inflation, the Fed’s policy tightening and an uncertain geopolitical situation. The broader market's rotation towards value stocks is expected to continue this year as well, believe experts at Goldman Sachs, according to a Bloomberg report published earlier in January.  A Goldman Sachs team led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a note that value stocks will gain more traction in 2023 as tech stocks continue to feel margin pressure.The euphoric rise of technology stocks after the pandemic gave way to speculative buying. Investors were willing to pay a premium for loss-making tech companies whose profits lie far into the future. But as the market began to correct itself, investors grew more wary about tech stocks and were unable to develop a stomach for huge risks. The Bloomberg report also quoted several experts who think value stocks will be preferred over tech plays in the months to come. For example, Bank of America Corp.’s Savita Subramanian said, according to the report, that investors should “avoid crowded parts of the stock market, including big tech.”Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson also reportedly warned that profit margins at tech companies are likely to take a hit this year.Investors are now preferring value stocks with strong fundamentals and profitable businesses. Many of the popular value stocks also pay dividends. As you will see in this article, financial, energy and healthcare dominate this space. On the other hand, value investors are continuing to avoid tech stocks that are loss-making and don’t have strong growth prospects in the short term. However, major tech stocks, like Meta Platforms, are on the radar of value investors since tech companies of this scale are offering attractive entry points for investors, according to some analysts. More on that later in the article. First, let’s see our methodology for this article.Story continuesOur  MethodologyFor this article, we scoured the top holdings of Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) and picked stocks that have PE ratios of less than 18 as of January 26. The result was a long list of stocks. We then picked 15 of these stocks that have the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of the end of the third quarter. For that we used Insider Monkey’s premium database of 920 hedge funds. That means the stocks mentioned in this article are some of the most popular undervalued value stocks among elite hedge funds.The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies.Most Undervalued Value Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds15. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 493M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. A total of 49 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) at the end of the September quarter.14. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) ranks 14th in our list of the most undervalued value stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has upped its dividends consistently for over a decade now. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)’s dividend yield as of January 26 stands at over 3% while its PE ratio is 15.68. Earlier in January, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.775 per share, in line with previous. Forward dividend yield at the time came in at 3.38%.As of the end of the third quarter, 52 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), compared to 58 funds in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes was $3.3 billion.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text)13. EOG Resources, Inc.

(VZ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-verizon-communications-140002043.html,1675087202,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share, indicating a change of -9.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -7.7%. This estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.87 indicates a change of +1.9% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $138.27 billion and $140.23 billion estimates indicate +1.1% and +1.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

286,09ed13aa-728b-3e4b-bfef-4c8676445a39,SWK,2023-01-31,Earnings Preview: Kennametal (KMT) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-kennametal-kmt-q2-150003760.html,1675090803,STORY,"['KMT', 'SWK']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Kennametal (KMT) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis engineered products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -34.3%.Revenues are expected to be $492.77 million, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Kennametal?For Kennametal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kennametal will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Kennametal would post earnings of $0.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of -8.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Kennametal doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), is soon expected to post loss of $0.33 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -115.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.94 billion, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been revised 13.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -69.70%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Stanley Black &amp; Decker will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

291,40c6f28e-895c-3c1c-a9ac-c4309d522982,MCK,2023-01-31,2 Medical Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-medical-stocks-consider-buying-211409493.html,1675113249,STORY,"['MCK', 'SNY']","[Many stocks in the medical sector have been able to outperform the broader market over the last year as healthcare continues to be a vital part of the economy.There is a continued need for prosperous healthcare companies. Here are two medical stocks investors may want to consider buying ahead of earnings this week.McKesson MCKTo start, investors may want to consider buying health care services and information technology company McKesson Corporation which is set to report its fiscal Q3 earnings on February 1.McKesson’s Medical-Dental Supplies Industry is currently in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries and MCK stock also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimate revisions trending higher.Standing out among the Medical sector as a diversified healthcare provider, McKesson’s Distribution Solutions segment primarily distributes pharmaceutical drugs, medical-surgical supplies, and other healthcare-related products globally with its Technology Solutions segment providing enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, and strategic management software solutions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Preview:  McKesson’s fiscal Q3 earnings are expected at $6.34 per share, which would be a 3% increase from Q3 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected to be up 4% and rise another 6% in FY24 at $26.36 a share.On the top line, Q3 sales are forecasted to be $70.48 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are now anticipated to be up 4% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 to $286.53 billion. More impressive, Fiscal 2024 would represent 33% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $214.31 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that McKesson could slightly top bottom-line estimates for its fiscal Q3 with the Most Accurate Estimate at $6.36 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $6.34.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesTakeaway: The top and bottom line growth for McKesson continues to be very impressive at this stage in the company’s corporate life. Even better, trading around $380 per share and 15.3X forward earnings, MCK stock trades nicely below its decade high of 22.1X and closer to the median of 12.2X.McKesson’s valuation is reason to believe there could still be more upside for McKesson stock, with MCK up +48% in the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -11%. Plus, MCK’s +269% over the last decade also beats the benchmark’s +173%.Sanofi SNYAnother medical stock investors will want to pay attention to before its Q4 earnings on February 3 is the pharmaceutical company Sanofi.Sanofi primarily manufactures and markets prescription drugs in Europe and the United States with SNY stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates have continued to go up over the quarter for its current fiscal 2022 and FY23.Sanofi’s prescription drugs focus on major therapeutic areas such as multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular, immunology, neurology, oncology, rare disease, rare blood disorders and diabetes, among others. Sanofi’s Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry is currently in the top 38% of all Zacks Industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Sanofi’s Q4 EPS is expected at $0.90 a share, up 14% from Q4 2021 earnings of $0.79 a share. Even better, this would round out fiscal 2022 earnings at $4.32 per share, an 11% YoY increase with FY23 EPS projected to rise another 2%.Fourth-quarter sales are forecasted to be $11.51 billion, up roughly 1% from the prior year quarter. Total sales would be up 3% YoY for FY22 and are projected to rise another 3% in FY23 to $47.43 billion. Plus, with 2019 sales at $42.14 billion, FY24 would represent 12% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: Sanofi is expected to top Q4 earnings expectations with The Zacks Consensus at $0.90 per share and the Most Accurate Consensus at $0.93 a share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Sanofi looks poised to have a strong Q4 report in terms of year-over-year growth, and topping bottom-line expectations for an 8th consecutive quarter could help SNY stock rally. There certainly appears to be more upside with shares of Sanofi trading around $48 and just 10.9X forward earnings.Sanofi stock trades 36% below its decade-long high of 17.2X and at a 20% discount to the median of 11.9X. While SNY’s decade price return performance is virtually flat to largely underperform the S&amp;P 500, past performance is not an indicator of future success. Over the last year, Sanofi is down -6% but this has outperformed the benchmark, and its attractive valuation points to more upside ahead.Bottom LineThese medical stocks look attractive before earnings, with both McKesson and Sanofi standing out from a valuation standpoint which could justify more upside especially if they can beat expectations and offer positive guidance. The possibility of such looks more plausible with annual earnings estimates trending higher and both companies expected to top bottom-line expectations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

292,5e97b945-b245-329f-8587-ab61a35ce211,MCK,2023-01-31,BD (BDX) Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bd-bdx-gears-q1-earnings-152203867.html,1675092123,STORY,"['BDX', 'MCK', 'CAH']","[Becton Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 2, before market open.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.75 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.4%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up for BDX prior to this announcement:Factors to NoteBD Life SciencesOn the fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter earnings call in November 2022, BD confirmed that it continued to witness lower COVID-only testing revenues, which led to a decline in the company’s Life Sciences segment. However, excluding COVID-only testing, an uptick in the Life Sciences segment’s base revenues was solid, with strong growth across both Integrated Diagnostic Solutions (IDS) and Biosciences (BDB) business units, despite supply constraints.Strength in IDS reflected strong base business revenue growth, driven by leveraging its increased BD MAX installed base, availability of its specimen management products and incremental clinical microbiology instrument installations. The Life Sciences segment’s BDB unit has also been recording solid demand for its FACSymphony A1/A5 SE analyzers and FACSymphony S6 sorter over the past few months. These trends are likely to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, thereby contributing to the strength in base business despite the expected continued fall in COVID-only testing revenues. This is likely to have significantly driven up the segmental revenues.Other notable products that are likely to have continued to witness robust product adoption in the fiscal first quarter include BD Research Cloud and CerTest VIASURE Monkeypox molecular research use only assay (BD and CerTest Biotec’s newly developed molecular polymerase chain reaction assay for the monkeypox virus).Story continuesIn October 2022, BD announced a co-exclusive commercial agreement with Magnolia Medical Technologies, Inc., aimed at helping U.S. hospitals reduce blood culture contamination to help improve testing accuracy and ultimately improve clinical outcomes. In August, BD announced a worldwide commercial collaboration agreement with Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. The same month, BD entered into a collaboration with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings or LabCorp. These strategic tie-ups are likely to have aided BD in the fiscal first quarter, thereby driving up revenues.However, the continued decline in COVID-only testing revenues is likely to have weighed on BD’s Life Sciences segmental revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter BD Life Sciences revenues is pegged at $1.28 billion, suggesting a decline of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company Price and EPS SurpriseBecton, Dickinson and Company price-eps-surprise | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteBD InterventionalThis segment continued to witness a strong worldwide performance in Advanced Repair and Reconstruction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by the continued strong market adoption of Phasix hernia resorbable scaffold. Biosurgery also performed well during the last-reported quarter.Revenues in Peripheral Intervention were also strong, driven by biopsy needles and filters, continued global penetration of Rotarex and the acquisition of Venclose, which is expanding BD’s focus across chronic disease settings. These trends are likely to have been witnessed in the fiscal first quarter, thereby significantly pushing up the segmental revenues.Robust Urology and Critical Care revenues were driven by continued strong demand for its chronic female incontinence products with PureWick in acute care and alternative care settings. This is likely to have also contributed to the segmental revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter BD Interventional revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion, suggesting a decline of 14.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors to NoteBD is likely to have witnessed continued momentum in its Medical segment, attributable to strong demand for the company’s durable core products, driven by competitive gains in catheters and vascular care devices.BD launched a next-generation glass prefillable syringe — BD Effivax Glass Prefillable Syringe — in September 2022. The product is likely to have witnessed robust adoption in recent months, thereby driving up revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the current unstable macroeconomic business environment, resulting from the supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures, is likely to have weighed on the company’s fiscal first-quarter revenues, raising our apprehension.The Estimate PictureFor first-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54 billion for total revenues implies a decline of 9.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.This compares to our revenue estimate of $4.51 billion for the quarter.The consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $2.67, indicating a decline of 26.7% from the prior-year period’s reported number.We estimate the fiscal first-quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.64.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for BD this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: BD has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%.

BIO is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 16, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of $2.60 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. Moreover, earnings beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters. The trailing four-quarter average surprise is 31.52%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayBio-Rad’s Life Science segment has been registering robust revenue growth over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to have continued in the fourth quarter on the back of sustained sales gains in terms of the company’s process media, western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products. During the third-quarter earnings update, the company stated that it continued to witness a strong order backlog for ddPCR instruments, which is expected to have made significant contributions to the fourth-quarter top line.During the third quarter, BioRad launched the QX600 ddPCR system and witnessed a strong order pipeline. We believe this trend to have continued through the fourth quarter, led by strong market adoption, thus adding to Q4 revenues.Our model suggests Life Science revenues of $351.8 million for the fourth quarter, suggesting 7.7% year-over-year growth.Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Quote Bio-Rad, during the October update, noted that it is witnessing accelerated growth within the Clinical Diagnostics segment, driven by its strong business generation within blood-typing, quality control and infectious disease product. We expect this trend to have continued through the fourth quarter on the back of the continued opening of the economy. Moreover, we expect Bio-Rad to have witnessed increased consumables volume for diagnostics in the fourth quarter, driven by a strong recovery in routine testing markets.Story continuesHowever, due to the Russia-Ukraine war situation, supply chain constraints have been impacting instrument placements. Further, a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases across many countries compared to the year-ago period is likely to have hit demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-related products, thus impacting the company’s top line.Our model projects Clinical Diagnostics revenues of $396.7 million for the fourth quarter, suggesting a 2.1% year-over-year decline.Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $753.04 million, calling for a growth of 2.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.45, suggesting a rise of 7.5% from the prior-year reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chance of beating estimates.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, pharmaceutical revenues amounted to approximately $45.8 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The performance reflects branded pharmaceutical sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. This momentum is likely to have continued in the fiscal second quarter.The company’s generics program sales were strong during the last reported quarter. The company's to-be-reported quarter results are likely to gain from this trend.Last year, the company announced the addition of a new distribution center in the Columbus, OH area, lending support to Cardinal Health’s at-Home Solutions business.These developments are likely to have favored the company's fiscal second-quarter performance.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and ConsensusCardinal Health, Inc. Price and ConsensusCardinal Health, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteIt is worth mentioning here that in the fiscal first quarter, Cardinal Health's Medical segment displayed considerable weakness due to the divestiture of the Cordis business as well as a decrease in products and distribution volumes. The trend is expected to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Cardinal Health’s Medical segment has been facing declining sales, following the divestiture of the Cordis business in 2021. Moreover, a decrease in products and distribution volumes hurt the segment’s top line during first-quarter fiscal 2023.Story continuesDuring the same quarter, the segment’s bottom line was hurt primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain restrictions in products and distribution.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

301,04cf20f1-f1c5-38a5-b0e2-f2f1824c2ad2,CMI,2023-01-31,Cummins (CMI) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-cmi-earnings-expected-grow-150003668.html,1675090803,STORY,['CMI'],"[The market expects Cummins (CMI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis engine maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +64.9%.Revenues are expected to be $7.36 billion, up 25.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cummins?For Cummins, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cummins will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cummins would post earnings of $4.88 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.21, delivering a surprise of -34.22%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cummins doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CMI) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cummins-inc-140002768.html,1675087202,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins (CMI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.70 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. This estimate has changed -3.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.20 indicates a change of +31.2% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cummins is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cummins, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.36 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.66 billion and $31.01 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +12.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.9%. EPS of $3.21 for the same period compares with $3.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.39%. The EPS surprise was -34.22%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

Injuries no doubt hurt the ratings as the Eagles eviscerated the Niners, down to their fourth string QB. But a massive number well north of 30, probably 40 million no doubt watched Patrick Mahomes escape the top burrow, and the Bengals should get those numbers later tonight-- just the latest example of the NFL continuing to assert its will over the entire television landscape.However, the league took a big L in their streaming kickoff-- ratings for Amazon Thursday Night Football down an astounding 41% from 2021 from an average of 16.4 million to fewer than 10 million viewers. Ratings for ESPN solid just slightly down from last season-- 13.4 million.Eagles-Chiefs will be awesome more than 110 million people-- excuse me-- will watch, while the battle bean counters are considering is ratings versus revenue. And this one is a blowout, unlike the Super Bowl. Amazon and the NFL want more viewers on Thursday night, but cash is king here. The league still featured 88 of the top 100 most watched shows in 2022.And here's the score that matters most-- $113 billion over 11 seasons. That's how much the league's media partners will fork over. YouTube Sunday NFL Ticket deal said to be worth as much as $2.5 bill per year. The Commish-- he sees cord cutting accelerating more than 20 million since 2014, a number expected to grow to 80 million by '26. The most common age group to adios cable-- 18 to 29-year-olds.Amazon would point out their median age viewer this season is 47. That may sound old. It's seven years younger than the legacy networks. The ratings will improve as streaming picks up. And the matchups will also improve. Al Michaels called them dreadful and equated them to selling used cars. They have to be better. But like the big banks, the NFL is too big to fail. And they're too big to care about one ratings miss. Like recent earnings reports, guidance is all that matters here. And football is 100% recession proof.Story continuesMy point being, a lot of people are making a lot on this streaming number, Seana, and for good reason. It's Amazon. But they're not scared. They're not scared one bit. Growth is all there. The league will continue to explode when it comes to television ratings. And Amazon's numbers, I think, will grow over the years. NFL's big question was, would it look competent? Would the stream go down? Would the broadcasters be solid? It looked just like NBC or CBS, except for the awful matchups.SEANA SMITH: Well, it was just an amazing, amazing way that they did this season. Like you were saying, expectations were so low. I think initially there was a lot of fanfare about how maybe they would include certain things that would just stick out just in terms of streaming versus traditional cable. Clearly, we didn't get that. But like you're saying, there was no huge mishaps in terms of--DAVE BRIGGS: Nothing.SEANA SMITH: --airing these games. That was a massive win for Amazon. Everything that's come out of Amazon saying how pleased they were, how excited they were, with how smooth this season went-- big question, I think, going forward as we do see more and more games stream here over the next several years, just how that, of course, then differs. Lots of questions about how Amazon might be able to incorporate more of its business, its prime business into those broadcasts.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: But clearly, NFL is a massive winner here. Super Bowl coming up-- like you said, about 110 million people expected to watch.DAVE BRIGGS: No question.SEANA SMITH: No slowing down in the NFL right now.DAVE BRIGGS: I expect that shopping will inevitably become part of the NFL Amazon broadcast.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't think we're going to see it for three, four, maybe even five years, as they want to prove competency first. But keep an eye on this-- Black Friday--SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: --NFL game this coming season on NFL on Amazon. I don't know how there won't be some type of--SEANA SMITH: They have to.DAVE BRIGGS: --shopping collaboration. It's unavoidable.SEANA SMITH: Oh, it's unavoidable. And it's so, so smart here for Amazon to go and--DAVE BRIGGS: What have you got, Eagles or Chiefs?SEANA SMITH: Eagles. I'm from Philly. It's not even a question.DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: You do?DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: We're going to talk about it.

313,5d87240d-9265-3873-a97d-4bc519e87ee8,AKAM,2023-01-31,New Report Finds Increase in DDoS Attacks Targeting the Financial Services Industry,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-finds-increase-ddos-attacks-113200693.html,1675164720,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Study identified increasing use of DDoS as political toolRESTON, Va. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 31, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- FS-ISAC, the member-driven, not-for-profit organization that advances cybersecurity and resilience in the global financial system, and Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today released new research on the threat that Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks pose to the financial services sector.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)The report, titled, The Evolution of DDoS: Return of the Hacktivists, notes that 2022 saw a 22 percent uptick in the volume of DDoS attacks targeting financial firms. This is especially true across Europe, where the attacks increased by 73 percent, and where financial services were the target of 50 percent of all DDoS assaults.The Evolution of DDoS: Return of the Hacktivist finds that much of the increase in DDoS attacks is driven by groups that have taken sides in the Russia-Ukraine war or other geopolitical conflicts. This includes organizations such as Killnet, which has targeted the United States and nations throughout Europe.Other major findings of the report include:Taking a cue from ransomware attacks, many DDoS campaigns now include extortion tactics.DDoS can serve as a cover for other, potentially more damaging cyber activities such as infiltration of systems and exfiltration of data and malware installation. This means that when cybersecurity teams encounter DDoS, they must also be on the alert for other types of attacks, putting extra strain on already limited resources.The evolution of DDoS means that firms must update their risk profiles and mitigation measures accordingly. Far from a low-level annoyance, DDoS should increasingly be considered a key cyber defense challenge. The report discusses several mitigation strategies, including network best practices, cyber hygiene and resilience.As more services are moved to the cloud or contracted in an aaS (as-a-Service) model, those services will depend on other supply chain components. Service disruptions anywhere in the supply chain can have a serious impact on an organization's operation.Story continues""The continued evolution of DDoS shows that it is far from a solved problem,"" said Teresa Walsh, Global Head of Intelligence at FS-ISAC. ""Working with our sector's critical providers like Akamai, who have first-hand knowledge of how DDoS is affecting the financial sector, enables us to arm our members with the understanding and guidance they need to better protect their firms and customers.""""Though DDoS attacks have been around for some time, we are seeing that they are evolving in new, innovative and aggressive ways,"" said Steve Winterfeld, Advisory CISO at Akamai. ""We teamed up with FS-ISAC to produce The Evolution of DDoS: Return of the Hacktivists in an effort to better educate the financial community about the threats of DDoS and to offer some threat trends and best practices for the sector to better combat these attacks.""The collaboration on this report is a product of Akamai's founding participation in FS-ISAC's Critical Providers Program, launched in 2022 to bolster the financial sector's supply chain security .About FS-ISACFS-ISAC is the member-driven, not-for-profit organization that advances cybersecurity and resilience in the global financial system, protecting the financial institutions and the people they serve.

(NYSE: HP) reported net income of $97 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $720 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $46 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, from operating revenues of $631 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The net income per diluted share for first quarter of fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 include $(0.20) and $(0.03) of after-tax losses, respectively, comprised of select items(1). For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, select items were comprised of:$(0.20) of after-tax losses pertaining to a non-cash impairment for fair market adjustments to decommissioned rigs and equipment that are held for sale and non-cash fair market adjustments to our equity investmentsNet cash provided by operating activities was $185 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to $117 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""Almost a year has passed since we set into motion plans to achieve revenue per day in excess of $30,000 and direct margins of 50% in our NAS segment. These financial guideposts were established as proxies for what is required to generate favorable economic returns in this capital-intensive business. This recent quarter marks a milestone in achieving that revenue per day goal, and we are making strong progress towards the direct margin goal. The Company has made significant headway in just a year which has generated considerable shareholder value. Our first fiscal quarter results of 2023 show another strong sequential improvement in our financial performance and the continuation of momentum established in fiscal 2022.""As expected, both the industry's and H&amp;P's incremental rig adds during the December quarter moderated relative to what we have seen during the December quarters of the last two years. This is largely attributed to capital discipline exhibited by our customers and their desires to maintain capital budgets and improve more sustainable shareholder returns. We believe our customers' discipline has been positive for the overall economic health of this cyclical industry, enabling oilfield service companies, like ourselves, to better plan and mirror a similar discipline within our own business. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our plan of adding no more than 16 incremental rigs to our NAS rig count during fiscal 2023 dependent upon customer demand and will look for contract rollovers, also referred to as contractual or rig churn, to satisfy other points of rig demand. We anticipate financial results to remain on an upward trajectory, with direct margins per day during our second fiscal quarter moving closer towards our targeted margin levels. This trend continues to be driven by improved contract pricing impacting more of our fleet, especially with rollovers of term contracts even as incremental rig adds temper.""Turning to the other operational segments, our Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment remains a steady, reliable contributor to the Company's overall financial performance; however, we do expect some variability later in the year as one rig's contract is set to expire in the fourth fiscal quarter. Regarding the International Solutions segment, the main concentration of the Company's expansion efforts here is centered around unconventional drilling, where we have extensive experience and can provide substantive value to customers with a compliment of people, processes, rigs and technology. We are moving forward on several fronts to set the Company up for future growth. Preparations to send a super-spec rig to Australia are well underway, as is the completion of our planned super-spec upgrades in Argentina in fiscal 2023. Efforts to grow our Middle East presence continue with the pursuit of additional work in the region and our operational hub, which should be stood up during the last half of fiscal 2023.""Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""Maintaining a fiscally disciplined approach to the business remains a key tenet in our strategy and is a major driver behind the Company's improving financial results. This approach culminates with the 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan, which is projected to augment our established $1.00 per share annual base dividend with an expected supplemental dividend of $0.94 per share. Additionally, the plan allows the flexibility for further investment opportunities, additional supplemental dividends, and/or share repurchases. Along those lines, since the beginning of the fiscal year, we executed on what we view as opportunistic repurchases and bought back approximately 1.3 million shares for roughly $60 million. Additionally, our evergreen authorization to repurchase up to 4 million shares in any calendar year was increased for calendar 2023 by 1 million shares by our Board of Directors bringing the 2023 authorization to 5 million shares.""During the quarter, as part of our international expansion strategic initiative, we evaluated the make-up and applicability for future work across our global rig fleet from the perspective that our international growth focus is centered around unconventional drilling. As a result, we decommissioned eight international rigs in Argentina and incurred a $12 million impairment charge. Going forward, the preponderance of our global onshore rig fleet is designed for unconventional drilling and we still plan to export six rigs to the Middle East after they are converted to walking configurations in the back half of fiscal year 2023.""Ours is a dynamic business and expectations change and can often change quickly due to a variety of circumstances. In that regard, while we still expect to activate up to 16 rigs in our North America Solutions segment during fiscal 2023, the highest potential active rig count that we expect to achieve is now 191 due to the loss of a rig in a fire. Additionally, expectations on the timing of sending super-spec rigs to the Middle East and Australia were delayed a few months and hence so were the costs associated with those rig mobilizations resulting in our International Solutions direct margins being higher than anticipated for the first fiscal quarter.""John Lindsay concluded, ""Through the hard work and dedication of our employees during this past year, we were able to take advantage of healthier industry conditions and H&amp;P's fiscal discipline to improve the profitability of the Company. Working closely with customers to identify and then provide industry-leading drilling solutions, we are creating value for these customers and receiving compensation for the value we helped create. We will carry this mindset forward to the benefit of both customers and shareholders.""Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023North America Solutions:This segment had operating income of $145.3 million compared to operating income of $92.1 million during the previous quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the continued benefit of healthy contract economics especially as rollovers of older term contracts drove improved average pricing across the fleet.Direct margins(2) increased by $56.8 million to $260.3 million as both revenues and expenses increased sequentially. Quarterly operating results were impacted by the costs associated with reactivating rigs; $8.6 million in the first fiscal quarter compared to $7.5 million in the previous quarter.International Solutions:This segment had operating income of $1.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.8 million during the previous quarter. Absent an impairment charge of $8.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the improvement in operating income was driven by the increase in revenue days and lower expenses primarily associated with rig mobilizations that were delayed.Direct margins(2) during the first fiscal quarter were $13.8 million compared to $3.3 million during the previous quarter. Current quarter results included a $0.3 million foreign currency loss compared to a $1.2 million foreign currency loss in the previous quarter.Offshore Gulf of Mexico:This segment had operating income of $6.7 million compared to operating income of $6.6 million during the previous quarter. Direct margins(2) for the quarter were $9.5 million compared to $9.4 million in the prior quarter.Operational Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023North America Solutions:We expect North America Solutions direct margins(2) to be between $280-$300 million, which includes approximately $4.0 million in estimated reactivation costsWe expect to exit the quarter between approximately 183-188 contracted rigsInternational Solutions:We expect International Solutions direct margins(2) to be between $7-$10 million, exclusive of any foreign exchange gains or lossesInternational Solutions direct margins(2) are expected to be reduced by operating costs related to establishing our Middle East hubOffshore Gulf of Mexico:We expect Offshore Gulf of Mexico direct margins(2) to be between $8-$10 millionOther Estimates for Fiscal Year 2023Gross capital expenditures are still expected to be approximately $425 to $475 million;approximately two-thirds expected for North America Solutions, including maintenance per active rig of $1.1 to $1.3 million and reactivating up to 16 super-spec rigs, of which six are planned walking conversionsapproximately one-quarter for International Solutions, including five super-spec upgrades and six reactivations that will be also converted to walking capabilities for export from the U.S. fleetremainder for corporate and information technology expendituresongoing asset sales include reimbursements for lost and damaged tubulars and sales of other used drilling equipment that offset a portion of the gross capital expenditures and are expected to total approximately $65 million in fiscal year 2023Depreciation for fiscal year 2023 is still expected to be approximately $400 millionResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2023 are still expected to be roughly $28 millionGeneral and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2023 are still expected to be approximately $195 millionCash taxes for fiscal year 2023 are still expected to be approximately $190-$240 millionSelect Items(1) Included in Net Income per Diluted ShareFirst quarter of fiscal year 2023 net income of $0.91 per diluted share included $(0.20) in after-tax losses comprised of the following:$(0.09) of non-cash after-tax losses pertaining to an impairment for fair market adjustments to decommissioned rigs and equipment that are held for sale$(0.11) of non-cash after-tax losses related to fair market value adjustments to equity investmentsFourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 net income of $0.42 per diluted share included $(0.03) in after-tax losses comprised of the following:$0.02 of non-cash after-tax gains related to fair market value adjustments to equity investments$0.01 of after-tax gains related to the sale of equipment$(0.06) of after-tax losses related to a lump sum settlement for a distribution from the pension planConference CallA conference call will be held on Tuesday, January 31, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) with John Lindsay, President and CEO, Mark Smith, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Dave Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations, to discuss the Company’s first quarter fiscal year 2023 results.

Price and EPS SurprisePTC Inc. price-eps-surprise | PTC Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderContinued healthy demand for products, especially digital transformation and software-as-a-service or SaaS, across all segments and regions is expected to have driven the bookings performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased demand for codebeamer products in industries like automotive and medical devices are tailwinds.Strength in the industrial Internet of Things solutions and solid demand for product lifecycle management (PLM) offerings and computer-aided design are expected to have contributed to PTC’s fiscal first-quarter top line.A solid uptick in demand for Creo, Windchill platforms and ThingWorx DPM is likely to have acted as a tailwind. In fiscal 2022, PLM and CAD revenues were $1.137 billion and $796 million, respectively. The company is also working toward accelerating the SaaS transition by introducing new products like Windchill+ and Creo plus.Subscription-centric model and contributions from Arena Solutions and Onshape are expected to have favored top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.However, unfavorable forex movement, inflation and challenging global macroeconomic environment are expected to have weighed down on the company’s performance. Also, increasing research and development costs to fend off competition are likely to have acted as headwinds.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentOn Jan 4, 2023, PTC acquired cloud-based field service management (FSM) software company - ServiceMax.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the segment’s sales were up 11.7% year over year due to the positive impact of the forex movement.Easing supply-chain issues as well as increase in hardware sales due to price revisions for PlayStation 5 are other tailwinds. Operating income for the segment is likely to have been affected by higher costs for game software development and higher expenses associated with the acquisition of Bungie.Uncertainty prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions may have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. Weakness in Financial Services segment continues to be a major concern.Sales of televisions and smartphones are likely to have been affected by rising inflation, geopolitical turmoil in Europe and the economic slowdown in China.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Kings and Aristocrats List: 10 Biggest Stocks. Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings are the companies that have raised their dividend payouts for over 25 years and 50 years in a row, respectively. These companies have healthy balance sheets and have shown compelling performance over the years. Amid the current inflationary pressures, investors are considering dividend growers as these companies have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns.According to a report by Nuveen, an American asset management company, dividends have been a significant component of total returns of the stock market over the past few decades. During the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 43%, and 72% of the market’s overall return, respectively. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed the market with less risk from 1973 to 2021. Various other studies also revealed that dividend growers have been a reliable source of regular income for shareholders in the past. From December 1999 to June 2019, the S&amp;P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats generated a total return of 590.3%, with dividends accounting for 57% of the total returns, according to a report by S&amp;P Global.Lord Abbett also highlighted the importance of dividend growers in one of its reports. The stocks that have raised their payouts regularly have provided significant downside protection, according to the report.Dividend stocks like Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) are popular dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades. We will further discuss other dividend kings and aristocrats in this article.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Story continuesFor this list, we scanned elite groups of Dividend Kings and Dividend Aristocrats and selected top companies based on their market capitalizations.

While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”25.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

During our nearly seven-year holding period, the company’s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified. These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”17.

Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

Welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive 2022 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&amp;A, John Faucher.John Faucher: Thanks, Allison. Good morning. And welcome to our 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release.A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q4 results and our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&amp;A. Noel?Noel Wallace: Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning and I wish all of you a very Happy New Year. So I mostly wanted to focus on the year ahead today, as I think we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2023, even as we plan for a difficult macroeconomic environment and continued uncertainty. That said, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, including double-digit organic sales growth in Pet Nutrition and high single-digit organic growth in Oral Care. 2022 was our fourth straight year of delivering organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range and we delivered within or ahead of that range in every quarter over that time period, 16 consecutive quarters in all.Story continuesAnd is the continuing strengthening of our strategy that has allowed us to grow consistently through different operating environments, as each year has presented its own challenges and its opportunities. But if we stay focused on driving the core, leveraging our capabilities across our portfolio, innovating in faster growth adjacencies and tapping into faster growth channels and markets, we will continue to grow. And in 2023, as we continue to execute on our strategy, we expect to accelerate earnings growth and generate incremental cash flow to drive shareholder value. Why are we well positioned for this year despite all of the uncertainty in the world today? It starts with our portfolio. We operate in four highly focused categories. Growing categories that consumers use every day and where they look to trusted brands to help themselves and their pets lead healthier lives.Hygiene, TeethThe focus on healthier lives means these consumers are motivated by science-driven innovation with professional endorsement, which is an area of particular strength for us. And the importance of trust in our categories helps keep private label penetration relatively low and allows for premiumization behind differentiated benefits. And within these categories, we have strong market shares. With most of our revenues coming from brands that have a number one or number two market shares on a global basis. The second reason is our focus on building, sharing and scaling capabilities to drive growth. I will continue to talk about our digital transformation as it impacts everything we do. This year we benefited from continued efficiencies in our digital media spending through data-driven modeling.Our efforts on innovation need to deliver over the long-term, not just the launch year, and we have shifted our resources to deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation. In our prepared commentary, we talked about the share gains we are seeing in the whitening segment of the toothpaste category. It's a long-term strategy of launching Optic White Renewal and then Optic White Pro Series in the U.S. or our new MPS whitening technology where we are launching around the world, which leverages our superior R&amp;D capabilities to drive long-term share growth. And on top of that, we continue to launch at-home whitening and professional whitening products to enhance our credibility and expand our presence in the premium segment. And our focus on building revenue growth management capabilities, particularly through increased use of data and analytics is driving our pricing growth in ways beyond just list price increases.And the third reason is our strong balance sheet. Our combined financial resources provide us the flexibility to reinvest in our portfolio or pursue value-enhancing acquisitions like our pet food acquisitions, which enables us to drive faster growth. The final reason we are well positioned is the efforts we have put into offsetting the extraordinary cost increases we have seen over the past several years. We have driven consistent pricing and we look to take additional pricing in the first half of this year. Our Funding the Growth program delivered another strong year in 2022 and we expect even higher levels of savings in 2023. We announced our global productivity initiative one year ago and we began to see the benefits in our numbers in the second half of 2022.We expect even greater savings in 2023 to help fund investment and drive operating margin expansion. So we believe we are well prepared for 2023, but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. The macroeconomic environment outlook remains volatile, which can impact consumer spending. China remains a question mark as the country emerges from COVID lockdowns. While raw materials and foreign exchange remain headwinds, they look less onerous now. But as we learned last year, that can change quickly.

As companies move their digital assets to Cloud platforms, their anxiety around the security of their data is increasing. That’s why cybersecurity companies are continuing to see an increasing demand of their products from government and private sectors. According to a Bloomberg report published in November, Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at Spear Invest, said that security is usually the last area to see budget cuts in the enterprise sector. That’s why the analyst thinks the cybersecurity domain is expected to keep growing despite recession fears.“This constant underpinning of demand makes security a very attractive space, which is why people are getting in even though there’s so much uncertainty everywhere else,” Delevska reportedly said.Cybersecurity's ResilienceThe Bloomberg report mentioned a Morgan Stanley survey which sheds light on the resilience of the cybersecurity sector. Morgan Stanley’s quarterly survey showed that the demand in the broader software sector was slowing amid recession fears. However, according to the survey, top software executives said security was a top priority.The Bloomberg report also said that stocks in the cybersecurity group looked cheaper than the broader software sector. The security index, back in November when the report was published, was trading at 26 times estimated earnings and 1.3 times sales. The broader software sector index showed these reading at 28 and 5.7, respectively.Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president of First Trust Portfolios, according to the Bloomberg report, thinks the cybersecurity sector remains strong because cyber criminals are operating in a space that is not tied to the broader economy.Story continuesIn an interview with BNN Bloomberg, Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights, said that as companies move to Cloud, security remains the main focus of their attention. He said that Cloud security is becoming one of the biggest themes of the cybersecurity market.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs.

In Europe, they are the leading distributor of general automotive maintenance parts and supplies. Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada. The company operates through Allstate Protection, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Run-off Property-Liability segments. On December 2, The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) announced that it aims to generate long-term adjusted net income ROE of 14% to 17%.

While the analyst appreciates The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)’s pricing power, he believes the company will rebuild capital with lower buybacks. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 38 hedge funds were bullish on The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), compared to 37 funds in the earlier quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

Injuries no doubt hurt the ratings as the Eagles eviscerated the Niners, down to their fourth string QB. But a massive number well north of 30, probably 40 million no doubt watched Patrick Mahomes escape the top burrow, and the Bengals should get those numbers later tonight-- just the latest example of the NFL continuing to assert its will over the entire television landscape.However, the league took a big L in their streaming kickoff-- ratings for Amazon Thursday Night Football down an astounding 41% from 2021 from an average of 16.4 million to fewer than 10 million viewers. Ratings for ESPN solid just slightly down from last season-- 13.4 million.Eagles-Chiefs will be awesome more than 110 million people-- excuse me-- will watch, while the battle bean counters are considering is ratings versus revenue. And this one is a blowout, unlike the Super Bowl. Amazon and the NFL want more viewers on Thursday night, but cash is king here. The league still featured 88 of the top 100 most watched shows in 2022.And here's the score that matters most-- $113 billion over 11 seasons. That's how much the league's media partners will fork over. YouTube Sunday NFL Ticket deal said to be worth as much as $2.5 bill per year. The Commish-- he sees cord cutting accelerating more than 20 million since 2014, a number expected to grow to 80 million by '26. The most common age group to adios cable-- 18 to 29-year-olds.Amazon would point out their median age viewer this season is 47. That may sound old. It's seven years younger than the legacy networks. The ratings will improve as streaming picks up. And the matchups will also improve. Al Michaels called them dreadful and equated them to selling used cars. They have to be better. But like the big banks, the NFL is too big to fail. And they're too big to care about one ratings miss. Like recent earnings reports, guidance is all that matters here. And football is 100% recession proof.Story continuesMy point being, a lot of people are making a lot on this streaming number, Seana, and for good reason. It's Amazon. But they're not scared. They're not scared one bit. Growth is all there. The league will continue to explode when it comes to television ratings. And Amazon's numbers, I think, will grow over the years. NFL's big question was, would it look competent? Would the stream go down? Would the broadcasters be solid? It looked just like NBC or CBS, except for the awful matchups.SEANA SMITH: Well, it was just an amazing, amazing way that they did this season. Like you were saying, expectations were so low. I think initially there was a lot of fanfare about how maybe they would include certain things that would just stick out just in terms of streaming versus traditional cable. Clearly, we didn't get that. But like you're saying, there was no huge mishaps in terms of--DAVE BRIGGS: Nothing.SEANA SMITH: --airing these games. That was a massive win for Amazon. Everything that's come out of Amazon saying how pleased they were, how excited they were, with how smooth this season went-- big question, I think, going forward as we do see more and more games stream here over the next several years, just how that, of course, then differs. Lots of questions about how Amazon might be able to incorporate more of its business, its prime business into those broadcasts.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah.SEANA SMITH: But clearly, NFL is a massive winner here. Super Bowl coming up-- like you said, about 110 million people expected to watch.DAVE BRIGGS: No question.SEANA SMITH: No slowing down in the NFL right now.DAVE BRIGGS: I expect that shopping will inevitably become part of the NFL Amazon broadcast.SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't think we're going to see it for three, four, maybe even five years, as they want to prove competency first. But keep an eye on this-- Black Friday--SEANA SMITH: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: --NFL game this coming season on NFL on Amazon. I don't know how there won't be some type of--SEANA SMITH: They have to.DAVE BRIGGS: --shopping collaboration. It's unavoidable.SEANA SMITH: Oh, it's unavoidable. And it's so, so smart here for Amazon to go and--DAVE BRIGGS: What have you got, Eagles or Chiefs?SEANA SMITH: Eagles. I'm from Philly. It's not even a question.DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: You do?DAVE BRIGGS: I've got the Chiefs.SEANA SMITH: We're going to talk about it.

The event is often one of the biggest draws to national television. But with millions of households cutting the cord and competition among streaming providers heating up, viewership is expected to play out differently in 2023. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal has the details. Hey, Allie. So--ALLIE CANAL: Hey.JULIE HYMAN: --what have we seen so far in terms of viewership trends?ALLIE CANAL: Well, number one, Brad, I am also a huge Eagles fan, so go Birds. But yes, there has been an acceleration in cord cutting. There has been this decline in linear television overall. But when we talk about sports, the numbers don't lie here, especially when we look at those traditional cable operators, those traditional cable networks.According to Nielsen data cited by those networks, we actually see that there's been an uptick in NFL viewership over this past year. NBC, which airs those primetime games, averaging around 19.9 million viewers per week. CBS and Fox in those early afternoon games, 18.5 and 19.4 million respectively. And then for those later 4:00 PM games, CBS and Fox averaging each about 24 million. And just to put that all in perspective, that's NBC's highest NFL viewership since 2019, top viewership for CBS since 2015, and top viewership for Fox since 2016.So, folks are clearly still tuning in. And then if you compare that to Amazon Prime, which we know signed that 11-year $13 billion deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football, along with ESPN, which airs NFL's Monday night games on cable, NBC, CBS, and Fox still reign supreme. Amazon's Thursday Night games averaging around $9.6 million-- 9.6 million viewers, I should say, weekly. And then ESPN Monday Night, 13.4 million viewers. And those numbers, they're both down compared to 2021 with Thursday Night Football slipping 41% year over year. And that's really the concern.Story continuesWhat do we make with those Amazon Prime numbers? We saw a lot of success in the beginning of this season, the most signups for Prime for that first week of Thursday Night Football. But then we saw that significant drop-off, and there is this uncertainty right now in the current landscape with media, with streaming.And you do have to wonder if the NFL's alienating some of those fans by signing these exclusive streaming packages. But at the same time, I think it's clear that they want to diversify their broadcast a little bit. They signed that deal with YouTube as well. So I think it's a wait and see approach. And Amazon clearly emphasizing that this is a long-term play for the company, and they're going to learn and grow over time.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, they put that in their 2021 announcement, saying that they were trying to broaden the league's digital football to a larger audience. And that's when we really got that announcement of many of the network partnerships-- Amazon, CBS, ABC, and ESPN, Fox, and NBC. But all of them have big streaming numbers that they're trying to prop up as well. So what right do they have, or at least, what strategy, I should say, are they trying to implement within getting more streaming viewers for some of the football that they've been able to license out?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, and if you think about sports, that's been a big driver of M&amp;A. It's been a big driver overall. If you look at the top 100 programs, 82 out of the 100 are specifically NFL. And then some 94 out of the 100 are sports related. And I think that's why you're seeing these tech giants dabble in sports. It's why you're seeing streaming giants like Netflix explore different opportunities within sports.But you have to remember that with broadcast, with these sports partnerships, you also have promises that you make to advertisers. And Amazon's viewership fell short of roughly 12 million people that it had promised advertisers that they would reach. So what is the impact of that? What's the fallout for that?I do think the NFL, it's been looking for a refresh. It's been looking to attract those younger users. A lot of those younger users are on those streaming platforms, but it's going to be-- it's going to take time to really figure out what that means and what this data ultimately means. We're still early days. We're still early in a lot of these contracts, these partnerships. So it's a wait and see right now.BRAD SMITH: Were you the one that changed the light screen on the Empire State Building?ALLIE CANAL: I'm not-- I will neither confirm nor deny, but I loved it.BRAD SMITH: Smart. Your lawyers didn't say you had to answer that question. Allie Canal, thanks very much for joining us, breaking this down.ALLIE CANAL: Go, Birds.]"

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Executive Vice President, Investor Relations, Ms. Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead, Ms. Ryvicker.Marci Ryvicker: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. On this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Mike Cavanagh and Jason Armstrong, who are also joined by Dave Watson, Jeff Shell and Dana Strong, Brian and Mike will make formal remarks, while Dave, Jeff and Dana will also be available for Q&amp;A. Let me now refer you to Slide 2, which contains our safe harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our 8-K and trending schedules for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?Brian Roberts: Thanks, Marci, and good morning, everyone. I'm really proud of how our team executed throughout 2022. We achieved the highest levels of revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our company's history. And we returned a record $17.7 billion of capital to shareholders through both our recurring dividend, which we just increased for the 15th consecutive year and robust share repurchase activity. We did all this while accelerating investment in key growth initiatives, which are showing great progress, particularly our broadband network as we transition to 10G but also in Xfinity Mobile, Peacock and our theme parks. I attribute all this success to the incredible talent across our organization, who work collaboratively to ensure we are constantly evolving and innovating so that our customers have the absolute best experience with us at every point of interaction.Story continuesWhat also sets us apart is our very strong balance sheet, which, when combined with the cost actions we have taken this past quarter, position us to perform well no matter what the macro environment might bring. I want to start with cable, where our financial performance both for the year and the fourth quarter confirm that we are striking the right balance between rate and volume in residential broadband, and we plan to continue to do so in 2023. At Xfinity Mobile and Comcast business remain strong growth drivers and we have successfully identified the appropriate mix between cutting costs to drive efficiencies and investing for our future. We have always maintained an intense focus on providing the absolute best products and experiences, which comes down to having the highest capacity, most reliable and most efficient broadband network.Our evolution to 10G and the unique way we are pursuing this through DOCSIS 4.0 is a huge benefit for our customers across the entire footprint that they will all have access to an entire ecosystem built around multi-gigabit symmetrical speeds, some as early as this year. It's also great for the company investors as our transition to a virtual software-based network infused with the marvelous AI capabilities will not only provide tangible benefits when it comes to operating and capital expenses, but it will enable us to innovate faster than ever before, solidifying our leadership position in broadband, which is extremely important given what is certain to be continued increases in demand for both speed and usage. In fact, we continue to see signs of this today.Our residential broadband-only customers are now consuming nearly 700 gigabytes of data every month, and customers on our Gigabit Plus products now comprise one-third of our broadband subscribers. In addition to creating more value from our current customer base and further penetrating the total homes and businesses that we pass today, another great opportunity is for us to extend our networks to homes and businesses in the U.S. that do not have the ability to receive our services. To that end, we increased our passings by 1.4% or $840,000 in 2022, and we expect to accelerate in 2023, where we are aiming to add around 1 million while still maintaining the same CapEx intensity level we achieved in 2022, reaching nearly 62.5 million by the end of the year.We are taking a disciplined approach, and we'll only pursue those areas that have a return profile similar to what we have been able to historically achieve. Wireless is playing an integral part of our overall strategy at cable, and it's an area where we continue to shine. This past quarter was another record in net line additions, bringing us to over 5 million total lines in just five years. Only 9% penetration of our current base of residential broadband customers, we have plenty of runway ahead, and we're just getting started in offering wireless to our commercial segment, which is another great example of how we are selling more products into our existing base of business customers. When you combine our broadband network, WiFi overlay and MVNO with Verizon, we are in the best position to win in convergence.We have a leg up on our competitors with a capital-light strategy that does not involve customer or network trade-offs. At NBCUniversal, we are seeing some great momentum in Peacock and parks. And across all of NBCUniversal, our intellectual property is really resonating. We had the number 2 studio in terms of worldwide box office in 2022, fueled by a strong slate, including Jurassic, Minions, Nope, Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Black Bone, Halloween, which have also had great carryover success to Peacock through our Pay-One window and select day and date releases. And our box office momentum continued into the first quarter with M3GAN, so all in all, a really strong film slate. Peacock ended the year with over 20 million paying subscribers, more than double where we started.And we added over 5 million paid subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. Our success was broad-based, fueled by some of the films I just mentioned but also sporting events like the World Cup, NFL, Premier League, several new originals and our exclusive next-day broadcast of NBC. Looking ahead, and based on our experience to date, we expect our subscriber cadence will follow our content launches, which fall more in the second half of 23. And we continue to see positive trends in engagement churn and ARPU. Mark Woodburry had a fabulous first year as our CEO of the Parks business, and we hit a number of new records this past quarter. It was the highest fourth quarter EBITDA for the entire segment, led by Orlando and Hollywood, and Japan had the best EBITDA performance since 2019.This was driven by attendance that for us surpassed pre pandemic levels at all three parks. While attendance at our Park in Beijing was significantly impacted by COVID in 2022, we are seeing some exciting demand to start the year. Given the excellent returns we have generated to-date, we continue to seek ways to expand our parks. I'm really excited about our two recently announced extensions. First universal park designed specifically for younger audiences near Dallas, and the first year around horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas. These are new innovative ways to utilize our substantial IP, including from DreamWorks and Illumination, while also extending our brand, both of which had helped fuel growth in all of our parks. Our linear video business, we are managing subscriber declines by taking a disciplined approach to our cost base.We are continuing to invest in our global technology platform, and you will see a number of announcements from us in the weeks and months ahead. For example, in 2023, we will launch one global user interface for Sky Glass, Xfinity, X1, Flex, XUMO, at our U.S. and International partners. Every entertainment customer around the world will get the same Emmy award winning voice controlled experience. This scale not only brings us operational efficiencies, but it also puts us in the enviable position when it comes to conversations with distributors, OEMs, programmers, app developers and talent. At Sky, we are managing through the macro economic challenges in Europe. While staying intensely focused on retention and continuing to provide our customers with the best entertainment and connectivity experiences.We're seeing some encouraging results. In the UK, Sky Glass had the top selling UHD TV model. Sky mobile is the fastest growing mobile provider, surpassing three million lines. And we are narrowing the gap between us and the current number one broadband provider with Sky Broadband, now sitting at over 6.5 million subscribers. Wrapping up, our consistently strong financial performance, healthy balance sheet, record high return of capital of shareholders underscore how the scale capabilities and talent across our company enable us to successfully execute our long term growth strategy. I'm convinced we are on the right path and that we have the right team to capture our many opportunities and overcome whatever challenges happen along the way. So before handing over the call, I want to congratulate Jason Armstrong, recently promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Mike Cavanagh.Could not be more confident and the leadership team's ability to continue to drive us forward and create more value for our shareholders. Mike, over to you.Mike Cavanagh: Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to just say that it's been a pleasure serving as CFO of Comcast for the last seven plus years. And I couldn't be prouder to have Jason be my successor. Knowing that with Jason, the financial leadership of our company is in proven and expert hands. Since Jason didn't take over as CFO until early in the new year, I will handle the CFO portion of this call and hand it over to Jason for the first quarter call in April. So now I'll begin on Slides four and five to discuss our consolidated 2022 financial results. Revenue increased just under 1% to $30.6 billion for the fourth quarter and 4.3% to $121.4 billion for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% to $8 billion for the fourth quarter, and increased 5% to $36.5 billion for the full year.The quarterly results include severance expenses booked in each of our businesses, totaling $638 million, which is $541 million higher than the prior year period. Including this increase, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter, and 6.6% for the full year. Adjusted EPS increased 6.5% to $0.82 of share for the fourth quarter and 13% to $3.64 for the full year. And we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the fourth quarter and $12.6 billion for the full year, while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and theme parks, as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID. Now let's turn to our business segment results starting with Cable Communications on Slide six. Cable revenue increased 1.4% to $16.6 billion, EBITDA increased 1.5% to $7.2 billion and cable EBITDA margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 43.5%.These results include $345 million of severance expense, which is $305 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter, excluding severance cable EBITDA increased 5.8% and cable EBITDA margin improved by 190 basis points to a record high of 45.3%. These strong results also included the impact of Hurricane Ian in Southwest Florida, which resulted in the loss or severe damage to many homes we serve in this market. Excluding the hurricane impacts, we would have added approximately 4000 broadband customers versus the 26,000 loss we reported. And we estimate that we would have lost approximately 36,000 customer relationships versus the 71,000 we reported. Overall, our broadband customer results in the fourth quarter were fairly consistent with the prior two quarters, reflecting lower levels of new customer connections, offset by churn which remained well below 2019 levels.Now let's discuss cable financials in more detail. Cable revenue growth of 1.4% was driven by higher broadband wireless business services and advertising revenue, partially offset by lower video and voice revenue. Broadband revenue increased 5.4% driven by growth in ARPU and in our customer base when compared to last year. Broadband ARPU increased 3.8% year-over-year, when adjusting for some COVID related customer credits last year. This organic ARPU growth is similar to the growth we've generated over the last couple of quarters and is consistent with our strategy. We are focused on optimizing our customer relationships by consistently adding more capabilities, services and value, so as to provide the best broadband experience, which has and should continue to deliver broadband ARPU growth.The elements of growth this quarter include increased rate, attaching more customers to higher tiers, as well as other services. We expect ARPU growth will continue to be the primary driver of our residential broadband revenue growth in 2023. Wireless revenue increased 25%, mainly driven by service revenue, which was fueled by growth in customer lines. We added 1.3 million lines in 2022, including 365,000 lines in the fourth quarter, which is our highest number of net additions for any quarter on record. Business Services revenue increased 4.6%, which includes the results of Masergy in both this quarter and in the prior year period, as we lap the closing of this acquisition at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by rate, including customers taking faster data speeds, higher attach rates of our advanced products, and rate increases on some of our services.Television, Cable TV, Remote controlPhoto by Erik Mclean on UnsplashAdvertising revenue increased 9.1% driven by strong political revenue, partially offset by the absence of advertising revenue that is now part of XUMO, our joint venture with Charter. Adjusting for those items, cable advertising revenue decreased 1.6%, reflecting decline in our local core advertising business, partially offset by solid growth at our advanced advertising business. Video revenue declined 5.6% driven by year-over-year customer net losses, partially offset by ARPU growth of 5.8%, due to a residential rate increase we implemented at the beginning of 2022. And last, voice revenue declined 13% primarily reflecting year-over-year customer losses. Turning to expenses. Cable Communications fourth quarter expenses increased 1.4%, reflecting higher non-programming expenses, which included the $305 million in higher severance costs, partially offset by lower programming expenses.Programming expenses decreased 5.9%, reflecting the year-over-year decline in video customers partially offset by higher contractual rates. Non-programming expenses, which again include $305 million and higher severance costs, increased 5.6%. Excluding severance, these expenses were flat compared to last year, reflecting an increase in bad debt as we return to more normalized pre pandemic levels an increased technical and product support expenses driven by growth in our wireless business. These were offset by a decline in marketing and promotion and customer service expenses due to lower activity levels, efficiencies in running the business, and improvements we continue to make in our customer experience. Our focus on growing our high margin connectivity businesses, coupled with our focus on increasing operating efficiency and cost controls, drove strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2022, excluding the higher severance expense, we grew full year EBITDA by 5.7% and increased EBITDA margins by 110 basis points to 44.8%.We believe that our disciplined approach to running the business, including the benefits from our cost reduction efforts this quarter, positioned us to drive higher profitability, and further expand margins, both in 2023 and thereafter. Now, let's turn to Slide seven for NBCUniversal. Starting with total NBCUniversal results, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.9% to $9.9 billion, and EBITDA decreased 36% to $817 million, including $182 million of severance expense in the quarter, excluding severance EBITDA decreased 22%. Media revenue increased 2.6% to $6 billion, mainly driven by Peacock, which nearly doubled its revenue to $660 million and Telemundos broadcast of the World Cup. Advertising revenue increased 4%, reflecting an incremental $263 million from the World Cup, as well as strong growth at Peacock and a healthy contribution of political advertising, partially offset by a decline in linear advertising.If we exclude the World Cup, advertising revenue declined 5.6% reflecting softening in the overall advertising market, distribution revenue increased 3.8% reflecting growth at Peacock driven by increases in paid subscribers, which more than doubled compared to last year, as well as higher contractual rates at our networks partially offset by linear subscriber declines. Media EBITDA was $132 million in the fourth quarter including a $978 million EBITDA loss at Peacock, reflecting the cost of new content, such as our exclusive next-day broadcast and Bravo content, our robust lineup of Pay-One titles, day and date releases like Halloween, NFL Premier League and the World Cup. Peacock's full year EBITDA loss of $2.5 billion was in line with the outlook we provided a year ago.And for 2023, we expect Peacock losses to be up modestly to around $3 billion. As we've said previously, we believe 2023 will be peak losses for Peacock and, from there, steadily improve. Excluding Peacock, Media EBITDA in the fourth quarter decreased 13%, reflecting the lower revenue and fairly flat expenses despite the higher costs associated with broadcasting the World Cup. Looking to the first quarter. While we remain focused on managing costs, we expect underlying Media EBITDA, excluding Peacock, to continue to be impacted by the top line pressures at our linear networks. Moving to Studios. Revenue increased 13% to $2.7 billion driven by growth in content licensing and theatrical revenue. Content licensing was up 16% driven by the benefit of our carryover titles and the acceleration in film windows as well as healthy growth in television licensing.Theatrical revenue increased 47% due to the success of recent releases, including Ticket to Paradise, Puss in Boots, Violent Night and Halloween Ends. EBITDA increased $109 million to $160 million for the quarter, reflecting the higher revenue partially offset by an increase in marketing and promotion expense, reflecting the size and timing of this quarter's theatrical slate as well as the corresponding higher programming and production costs. At Theme Parks, revenue increased 12% to $2.1 billion, while EBITDA increased 16% to $782 million, our highest level of EBITDA on record for our fourth quarter. These results were driven by growth at our parks in the U.S. and Japan partially offset by our park in Beijing, which was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions.At our U.S. parks, we continue to see strong demand with attendance and guest spending up year-over-year and with Orlando and Hollywood both delivering record high EBITDA for the fourth quarter. Universal Japan continued to rebound since capacity restrictions were lifted at the end of March and delivered strong year-over-year EBITDA growth in the quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for Sky. Reported results were meaningfully impacted by currency translation due to the strengthening dollar, but I will speak to Sky's results on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, Sky revenue was relatively consistent compared to last year at $4.4 billion. Direct-to-consumer revenue was also consistent compared to last year, reflecting growth in the U.K. driven by wireless and broadband revenue offset by declines in Germany and Italy.On a customer basis, we added 129,000 customer relationships in the quarter with positive additions across all three territories, the U.K., Italy and Germany. These net additions were driven by streaming, broadband and wireless customer additions and reflect our team's strong execution in a challenging macroeconomic environment across Europe. Rounding out the rest of Sky revenue, content revenue increased 6.5% driven by licensing our entertainment content, and advertising revenue decreased 9.6% primarily driven by lower revenue in the U.K., reflecting the timing of the World Cup and the macro environment. Turning to EBITDA. Sky's EBITDA decreased 15% to $340 million, including $89 million of severance expense, which is $53 million higher compared to last year's fourth quarter.Excluding severance, EBITDA declined 2% compared to last year, reflecting an increase in direct network costs driven by growth in our residential mobile and broadband businesses and higher other expenses, which were mostly offset by lower programming costs due to the timing of sports programming as four weeks of EPL games were paused during the fourth quarter to accommodate the World Cup. However, we will incur higher sports costs in the first half of 2023, reflecting the higher number of games as the season is extended and the remainder of the games which were paused are now played. Now I'll wrap up with free cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in 2022, we generated around $12.6 billion in free cash flow while absorbing increased investments in Peacock and Theme Parks as well as higher working capital as content creation normalizes post COVID.Full year consolidated total capital investment increased 14.2% or $1.7 billion to $13.8 billion due to increased spending at NBCUniversal and Cable partially offset by a decrease at Sky. At Cable, total capital spending increased 8.3% or $695 million with CapEx intensity coming in at 11.4% primarily driven by investments to further strengthen and extend our network. In 2023, we expect CapEx intensity to stay at around 11%, similar to 2022 levels as we aim to accelerate our homes passed growth to about 1 million and continue to transition our entire broadband network to DOCSIS 4.0 over the next few years. NBCUniversal total capital spending increased $1.4 billion driven by parks CapEx increasing $1.1 billion, of which Epic was around $800 million and reflects our continued investment in new attractions like Super Nintendo World at Hollywood and Donkey Kong at Japan.In 2023, we expect parks CapEx to increase by around $1.2 billion over last year as we continue to build Epic, which we plan to open in 2025 and begin work on our recently announced park extensions mentioned earlier. The required investment to develop these extensions is nowhere near the scale of Epic or Universal Beijing but rather enable us to leverage our already large market opportunity and can serve as a model that contributes to even higher growth at Theme Parks in the future. Working capital was $3 billion for the year, a $1.5 billion increase over last year's level, reflecting a post-COVID ramp of investment in content creation. Turning to capital allocation. We ended the year with net leverage at 2.4 times and returned a total of $17.7 billion to shareholders, including $4.7 billion in dividend payments and $13 billion in share repurchases.For 2023, we expect to continue to maintain leverage at around current levels, which I expect will support continued strong capital returns. As we announced this morning, we are raising the dividend by $0.08 a share to $1.16 per share, our 15th consecutive annual increase. This reflects our long-standing balanced capital allocation policy. We're committed to investing organically in the businesses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and also returning a very healthy amount of capital to shareholders. Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I'll turn it back to Marci, who will lead the question-and-answer portion of the call.Marci Ryvicker: Thanks, Mike.

331,e79d5f50-d798-325c-b4cf-ca92d43cc201,PRU,2023-01-31,Is Axa (AXAHY) Stock Undervalued Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/axa-axahy-stock-undervalued-now-144002866.html,1675089602,STORY,"['PRU', 'AXAHY']","[Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Axa (AXAHY). AXAHY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.73. Over the past 52 weeks, AXAHY's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.47 and as low as 6.47, with a median of 7.89.AXAHY is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.11. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AXAHY's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.59. Over the last 12 months, AXAHY's PEG has been as high as 1.30 and as low as 0.41, with a median of 1.03.We should also highlight that AXAHY has a P/B ratio of 1.33. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.11. AXAHY's P/B has been as high as 1.33 and as low as 0.61, with a median of 0.91, over the past year.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Prudential Financial (PRU), an Insurance - Multi line stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Prudential Financial currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 8.37, and its PEG ratio is 0.99. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 9.73 and 1.59.Over the past year, PRU's P/E has been as high as 10.48, as low as 7.31, with a median of 8.64; its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.13, as low as 0.81, with a median of 1.03 during the same time period.Additionally, Prudential Financial has a P/B ratio of 2.23 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 3.11. For PRU, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.39, as low as 0.62, with a median of 1.23 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Axa and Prudential Financial are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, AXAHY and PRU sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc. V, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Infosys Ltd. INFY, Block, Inc. SQ and Devon Energy Corp. DVN.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Visa, Procter &amp; Gamble and InfosysThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc., The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Infosys Ltd. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+2.3% vs. -8.0%). The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. For fiscal 2023, net revenues are estimated to rise in the high single digits on a reported nominal dollar basis.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. The company beat fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings estimates on the back of steady domestic volumes and a rise in transactions. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -1.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry’s decline of -2.6%. The company is facing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, and product and packaging investments which threaten margins. The company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistent inflation, and higher freight and currency woes.Story continuesHowever, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter in its fiscal second quarter. The company’s organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Infosys have declined -20.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry’s decline of -20.4%. The company is suffering from increasing anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries. Higher subcontractor costs and its compensation revision with a higher variable pay and incentives are weighing on margins. Further, unfavorable currency fluctuations remain a major concern.Nevertheless, Infosys is gaining from large deal wins and fast-growing digital services. Its sustained focus on Agile Digital and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Core services is a tailwind. Strong demand for its services in cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, data and analytics are key drivers.Higher investments by clients in digital transformation, AI and automation are an upside. Solid traction of its CobaltTM cloud portfolio is a positive. According to the Zacks analyst estimates, Infosys’ revenues should grow at a CAGR of 9.6% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Infosys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Block, Inc. and Devon Energy Corp.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG) and Infosys Ltd. (INFY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+2.3% vs. -8.0%). The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. For fiscal 2023, net revenues are estimated to rise in the high single digits on a reported nominal dollar basis.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. The company beat fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings estimates on the back of steady domestic volumes and a rise in transactions. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -1.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry’s decline of -2.6%. The company is facing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, and product and packaging investments which threaten margins. The company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistent inflation, and higher freight and currency woes.However, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter in its fiscal second quarter. The company’s organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Infosys have declined -20.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry’s decline of -20.4%. The company is suffering from increasing anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries. Higher subcontractor costs and its compensation revision with a higher variable pay and incentives are weighing on margins. Further, unfavorable currency fluctuations remain a major concern.Nevertheless, Infosys is gaining from large deal wins and fast-growing digital services. Its sustained focus on Agile Digital and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Core services is a tailwind. Strong demand for its services in cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, data and analytics are key drivers.Higher investments by clients in digital transformation, AI and automation are an upside. Solid traction of its CobaltTM cloud portfolio is a positive. According to the Zacks analyst estimates, Infosys’ revenues should grow at a CAGR of 9.6% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Infosys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corp. (PGR), Block, Inc. (SQ) and Devon Energy Corp. (DVN).Mark VickerySenior EditorNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, cat loss exposure inducing underwriting volatility ails.Solid Cash App Adoption &amp; Square Ecosystem Aid Block (SQ)Per the Zacks analyst, Block is benefiting from strong Cash App engagement and its growing active customer base. Further, the company's growing momentum across Square Ecosystem remains a positive.High Margin Assets &amp; Cost Management Aid Devon Energy (DVN)Per the Zacks analyst Devon's strong production from its high margins assets and efficient cost management will drive performance over the long run.AbbVie's (ABBV) Skyrizi, Rinvoq Key to Long-Term GrowthThe Zacks analyst believes that AbbVie's new drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are going strong bolstered by approval in new indications. They can drive revenues once Humira loses U.S. exclusivity in 2023.Cologuard Sales Aid Exact Sciences (EXAS), Stiff Rivalry AilThe Zacks analyst is impressed with Exact Sciences' growth in legacy Screening business during the third quarter 2022 led by Cologuard volume growth. Yet, stiff rivalry remains a concern.Solid Performance Across Agility &amp; Reliability Units Aid FlexPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance benefited from strength across the Agility Solutions and Reliability Solutions segments. However, semiconductor shortage and stiff competition are concerns.Improving Retail Demand to Aid Macerich's (MAC) LeasingPer the Zacks Analyst, rebounding demand for Macerich's portfolio of premium shopping centers is likely to drive leasing activity in the near term. However, higher e-commerce adoption is a key woe.New UpgradesHarley-Davidson (HOG) Rides on Hardwire Strategic PlanThe Zacks analyst is optimistic of Harley-Davidson's 'Hardwire' strategy which aims at profitability through refreshed product offerings and technologies that better align with market trends.Copa Holdings (CPA) Benefits From Improving Air-Travel DemandThe Zacks Analyst is impressed with the fact that increased air-travel demand is aiding Copa Holdings' top-line performance.RPC (RES) to Benefit From Increased OilField ActivitiesPer the Zacks analyst, RPC is well-positioned to benefit from increasing oilfield activities in its industry, as the favorable commodity pricing scenario has driven upstream investments.New DowngradesRising Lease Operating Expenses Hurt Callon Petroleum (CPE)The Zacks analyst is concerned about Callon Petroleum since increasing lease operating expenses are hurting the upstream energy playe's bottom line.Higher Supply-Chain Costs Hurt McCormick's (MKC) MarginPer the Zacks analyst, escalated supply-chain costs are putting pressure on McCormick's gross margin. The company continued to encounter supply-chain hurdles during fiscal fourth quarter.Inflationary Pressures to Hurt Hasbro's (HAS) Prospects Per the Zacks analyst, Hasbro's operations are likely to be affected by inflationary pressures and a challenging holiday consumer environment.

(NYSE:PX)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-still-waiting-pull-back-101441233.html,1675160081,STORY,['PX'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 46.4x P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, P10's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for P10 peKeen to find out how analysts think P10's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is P10's Growth Trending?P10's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 41%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 4.1% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the six analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 86% over the next year. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 6.1%, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that P10's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of P10's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You always need to take note of risks, for example - P10 has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

What's Wall Street looking out for? Among other things, the impact of inflation on the numbers like the cost of commodities and labor. Also of interest: Store growth and evidence that consumers are cheerier.The good news is that labor costs and retention rates among employees are gradually improving allowing companies to return to ""an increased focus on retention &amp; training,” Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse said in a note to investors.Meanwhile, here’s what analysts expect from earnings announcements from five of the biggest food chains:McDonald's (MCD) is expected to be one of the first to report earnings on Tuesday, January 31, before the market open. Per Bloomberg consensus estimates, the fast food giant is expected to report the following Q4 2022 results:Revenue: $5.74 billion, down 4.6% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $2.44, up 6.3% year-over-yearU.S. same-store sales: up 7.62%International operated markets same-store sales: up 7.56%Wall Street's take: That revenue is compared to $5.87 billion, when growth was down 5.3% in Q3; that came in higher than Wall Street estimates of $5.70 billion, boosted by higher menu prices.CITI analyst Jon Tower said the firm expects “a generally positive update” from the company with strong trends here in the U.S., easing foreign exchange headwinds, and improvement in its foreign exposure, specifically “that the European business has already seen the worst of inflation’s impact on the top &amp; bottom-lines.” Tower’s price target is $279.00 and has a Neutral rating.Starbucks (SBUX) will unveil its next quarterly results, first-quarter fiscal year 2023, on February 2. Analysts expect a boost in revenue:Revenue: $8.74 billion, up 8.6% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $0.77 per share, up 2.7% year-over-yearU.S. Same Store Sales: up 9.13%International Sales: down 3.87%China Sales: down 13.31%Story continuesWall Street's take: Last quarter, revenue jumped just 3.3%. Credit Suisse's Silberman said the firm still views SBUX as “one of the highest quality growth companies in restaurants,” with accelerating “same-store sales and unit growth, and margin expansion to support 15-20% EPS growth.”(FILE) SHANGHAI, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 20, 2021 - A Starbucks cafe is seen in Shanghai, China, September 20, 2021. January 8, 2023 - Shanghai has become the first city in the world to have more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops, according to data on the number of Starbucks coffee shops in every city in China. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)That makes Starbucks an “an attractive risk/reward” stock. Silberman also expects the removal of the zero-COVID 19 policy in China to boost sales.The U.S. is the elephant in the room: Analysts are also expecting to hear more from the company about the changes to its reward program, which has gotten some poor reviews from fans. Those are set to take effect in the next fiscal quarter on February 13. Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating on shares and a price target of $116.00.Starbucks reported its fourth-quarter 2022 fiscal year 2022 results back in November.Yum! Brands (YUM), which operates KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Habit Burger Grill, is expected to report February 8; analysts expect a big jump in earnings per share:Revenue: $1.9 billion, up 1.7% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $1.26 per share, up 23.3% year-over-yearSame-Store Sales: up 4.40%KFC: up 4.84%Pizza Hut: 1.70%Taco Bell: 6.30%Habit Burger Grill unit: 0.86%Wall Street's take: On Dec. 13, the fast food company hosted an Investor Day. Executives outlined system-sales growth of 10% for its Q4 2022, driven by strength in the Taco Bell U.S. business.Andrew Charles of Cowen, who has a price target of $155.00 and Outperform rating, said there was major ""upside"" to Taco Bell's same-store sales, which makes up roughly 30% of the company's operating profits. Charles added that opportunities for upside include how the brand balances value and premium menu innovation, and ""to a lesser degree"" how the company benefits from late-night sales (8 p.m.- close). That's ""where the brand is having an easier time staffing versus peers,"" he said. Digital is a focus, accounting for $24 billion in sales as of Q3 2022, with a 40% digital sales mix.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is expected to report on February 7. For its fiscal fourth-quarter results, analysts expect:Revenue: $2.23 billion, up 13.9% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $8.92 per share, up 63.1% year-over-yearSame-store sales: 7.06%Wall Street's take: Last quarter, Chipotle brought in revenue of $2.23 billion, up 13.9% year-over-year. CITI, however, believes this quarter's expectations are “muted,” given ""company guidance around negative traffic and we understand the simple bear narrative (macro/too much price = persistent traffic issue).” In particular, Chipotle was directly impacted by the rising cost of avocados. To offset higher costs of food and labor, Chipotle raised menu prices 4% in August. That was the third time in 15 months. CITI has a Buy rating and $1,986 price target.A meal is seen in a Chipotle outlet in this photo illustration in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 7, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThis comes as Chipotle has big plans for the new year. Ahead of its busy season (March to May), it plans to hire 15,000 workers. This will help with the ultimate long-term goal to reach 7,000 locations in North America, with plans to open as many as 285 new restaurants in 2023, per Q3 results. BTIG Managing Director Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance when it comes to growth plans, ""they've been consistently stepping it up every year.""Shake Shack (SHAK) is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter results on February 16th after market close.Revenue: $238.4 million, up 17.3% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: -$0.11, down 11.1% year-over-yearSame-Store sales: 5.23%Wall Street's take: Shake Shack gave investors a preliminary look at its fourth-quarter results and its 2023 outlook at the ICR conference, a three-day event run by ICR partners. The burger chain announced plans to open 65 to 70 domestic and international locations in 2023, 40 of which will be company operated and nearly 30 owned by franchisers. One key development in the works: more drive thru locations, which tend to boost sales.Goldman Sachs was encouraged by the preliminary results. The firm wrote in a note, ""We are excited by SHAK’s diversification of store formats and think this will be key in driving unit growth for the company."" The firm has a Buy rating and $56 price target.Peter Saleh of BTIG, who moderated the interview at the conference, maintained a Buy rating and $60 price target following the preliminary results.In a note to investors, he said: ""While management did not get into detailed discussion on commodities or labor, it does appear as if the company is seeing promise in these areas, similar to the rest of the industry. While guidance for 1Q23 and the full year is lower than anticipated, we believe that could prove conservative as margin pressures ease while pricing remains elevated.""Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is expected to announce fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15. Analysts expect the followingRevenue: $901.87 million, up 16.1% year-over-yearAdjusted earnings per share: $0.58, up 18.9% year-over-yearSame-Store Sales: Cheesecake Factory: 4.94%North Italia: 9.60%Wall Street's take: Year-to-date shares are up more than 20%, despite two downgrades from analysts. UBS downgraded shares of from Neutral to Sell. UBS Analyst Dennis Geiger expects store sales to slow down for the fast-casual chain and for higher food and labor costs to take a toll on the company's bottom line. Whereas CITI downgraded the stock from a Buy to Neutral. CITI Analyst Jon Tower said that inflation and ""no incremental plans"" to tackle these higher costs makes it hard to gauge how the casual chain plans to grow its bottom line.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Consumer demand is key to determining whether the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening will help cool the U.S. economy without causing a recession.""Overall, the consumer, whether it's in Europe or the U.S., is actually holding up better than... what I would have expected a year ago or 6 months ago,"" Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said during a call with investors.Even so, he said the Big Mac maker still expects a mild to moderate U.S. recession this year, with a deeper, longer recession in Europe.Profit margins at company-operated restaurants were about 15% in the quarter because of higher labor, energy and commodity costs. The company said that full year 2023 company-operated margins will come in slightly lower than that.McDonald's is also the first major global restaurant brand to report quarterly earnings so far this year.Investors are hoping that as costs for butter, dairy and other ingredients start to fall, some chains could forecast more profitable restaurant operations this year.McDonald's profits will also be pressured this year by its plans to invest up to $2.4 billion on capital expenditures, about half of which will go to build 1,900 new restaurants around the world.Some of those will fund a big U.S. expansion, the chain's first in 8 years.But investors can ""digest that and then start looking to 2024, and the potential to really leverage McDonald's earnings growth,"" said Gretchen Novak, senior portfolio manager at Charles Schwab, which holds about 0.71% of McDonald's shares.Story continuesPRICES AND TRAFFICLike other fast-food chains, Chicago-based McDonald's raised prices of its burgers and fries last year to keep up with surging commodity and labor costs.The price hikes did not deter customers. Traffic rose 5% for full-year 2022, McDonald's disclosed on Tuesday, as its meals remained less expensive than many competitors, drawing low-income consumers.A Big Mac in New York City now costs about $5.39 - less than a $5.65 Venti Cappuccino at a nearby Starbucks.Low-income consumers are spending less with each McDonald's visit, but eating there more often, Kempczinski said.By the third quarter, McDonald's menu prices were 10% higher than the year before. It did not provide an update on higher menu prices on Tuesday.The chain launched its Cactus Plant Flea Market Box - an adult version of its Happy Meal for kids - with menu items including its Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets, helping it post better-than-expected U.S. sales.""McDonald's is in the right place at the right time for being a market share gainer in this environment,"" said Neuberger Berman analyst and portfolio manager Kevin McCarthy.McDonald's fourth-quarter global same-store sales also beat estimates with a 12.6% rise, compared with the average analyst estimate of an 8.6% increase, according to data from Refinitiv.The company reported profit of $2.59 per share, an increase of 16%. Analysts on an average expected profit of $2.45.McDonald's U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3% in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

The strong dollar weighed on results for the company, as revenue was flat for 2022 but rose 6% when measured in constant currencies, while systemwide sales increased 5% for the year and 11% in constant currencies.The company's full-year 2022 fiscal results reflect the $1.3 billion charge related to the company's sale of its Russia business, in addition to a $271 million gain related to the sale of Dynamic Yield.

Sales in the UK, Germany and France rose despite fears of a recession in Europe.The earnings report comes as investors watch for signs of a recession after record inflation last year. McDonald's could benefit if more lower-income customers switch over from higher-priced restaurants - as it did in the third quarter.Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said in the earnings release that the company expects ""short-term inflationary pressures to continue in 2023.""The company reported profit of $2.59 per share, an increase of 19%.Like other fast-food chains, Chicago-based McDonald's raised prices of its burgers and fries last year to keep up with surging commodity and labor costs.Even so, traffic rose 5% for full-year 2022 as McDonald's meals remained less expensive than many competitors, drawing low-income consumers.In October, Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said the company was ""gaining share right now among low-income consumers"" in the United States because of McDonald's ""affordability.""He did not define ""low income"" but data provider the NPD Group defines annual household incomes of $75,000 or less as ""lower income.""The company launched its Cactus Plant Flea Market Box - an adult version of its Happy Meal for kids - with core menu items including its Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets, helping it post better-than-expected U.S. sales.Visits to McDonald's U.S. locations rose 26% in the fourth quarter versus 2019 and were up nearly 30% compared with the previous year, according to data from location analytics firm Placer.ai. That is compared to a 0.6% decline for fast food overall in the fourth quarter over the previous year.Story continues""While McDonald's reputation as a value player helps in an environment where lower- to middle-income consumers are looking to stretch household budgets, the company is also driving visits through other means like celebrity meals and other marketing partnerships, its loyalty program, and improved drive-thru operations,"" said Placer.ai's head of analytical research, R.J. Hottovy.Visits to some other fast-food chains started to fall last summer as they hiked menu prices, he said.McDonald's U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3% in the quarter. Global revenue dropped 1% to $5.93 billion because of the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. In constant currencies, revenue rose 5%.

Company-operated margins were negatively impacted for both periods by the permanent restaurant closures as a result of the sale of the Company's business in Russia and the temporary restaurant closures in Ukraine, as well as by inflationary cost pressures. The year also reflected an income tax benefit associated with global tax audit progression.4THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS APPLY TO THESE TERMS AS USED THROUGHOUT THIS RELEASEConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales and transactions, respectively, at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction, natural disasters and acts of war, terrorism or other hostilities (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19, as well as those that remain closed in Ukraine). Restaurants in Russia were treated as permanently closed as of April 1, 2022 and therefore excluded from the calculation of comparable sales and comparable guest counts beginning in the second quarter of 2022. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.RELATED COMMUNICATIONSThis press release should be read in conjunction with Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filing for supplemental information related to the Company's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022.McDonald's Corporation will broadcast its investor earnings conference call live over the Internet at 7:30 a.m. (Central Time) on January 31, 2023.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Kings and Aristocrats List: 10 Biggest Stocks. Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings are the companies that have raised their dividend payouts for over 25 years and 50 years in a row, respectively. These companies have healthy balance sheets and have shown compelling performance over the years. Amid the current inflationary pressures, investors are considering dividend growers as these companies have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns.According to a report by Nuveen, an American asset management company, dividends have been a significant component of total returns of the stock market over the past few decades. During the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 43%, and 72% of the market’s overall return, respectively.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

UPS will pay a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.62 per share on all outstanding Class A and Class B shares. The dividend is payable March 10, 2023 to shareowners of record on February 21, 2023. In addition, the UPS Board of Directors has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the company’s existing authorization.2023 OutlookThe company provides certain guidance on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis because it is not possible to predict or provide a reconciliation reflecting the impact of future pension adjustments or other unanticipated events, which would be included in reported (GAAP) results and could be material.For the full year 2023, UPS expects revenue to be between $97.0 billion and $99.4 billion and consolidated adjusted operating margin of between 12.8% and 13.6%.The company is planning capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion, dividend payments to be around $5.4 billion, subject to board approval, and share repurchases to be around $3 billion. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%.* ""Adjusted"" amounts are non-GAAP financial measures.

Statements other than those of current or historical fact, and all statements accompanied by terms such as ""will,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""expect,"" ""estimate,"" ""assume,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""target,"" ""plan,"" and similar terms, are intended to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.From time to time, we also include written or oral forward-looking statements in other publicly disclosed materials. Forward-looking statements may relate to our intent, belief, forecasts of, or current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects, future results, or future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made and the future, by its very nature, cannot be predicted with certainty.Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties, include, but are not limited to the impact of: continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, financial performance and liquidity, our customers and suppliers, and on the global economy; changes in general economic conditions, in the U.S. or internationally; industry evolution and significant competition; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; increased or more complex physical or data security requirements, or any data security breach; strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees; results of negotiations and ratifications of labor contracts; our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation; disruptions to our information technology infrastructure; global climate change; interruptions in or impacts on our business from natural or man-made events or disasters including terrorist attacks, epidemics or pandemics; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international markets; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, or interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; significant expenses and funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in impairments of our assets; potential additional U.S. or international tax liabilities; increasingly stringent laws and regulations, including relating to climate change; potential claims or litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and subsequently filed reports. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements.Information, including comparisons to prior periods, may reflect adjusted results. See the appendix for reconciliations of adjusted results and other non-GAAP financial measures.Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFrom time to time we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures.Adjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Forward-Looking Non-GAAP MetricsFrom time to time when presenting forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, we are unable to provide quantitative reconciliations to the most closely correlated GAAP measure due to the uncertainty in the timing, amount or nature of any adjustments, which could be material in any period.Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging ActivitiesCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and any foreign currency hedging activities. These measures are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the impact of any foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities.Incentive Compensation Program Design ChangesDuring 2022, we undertook certain structural changes to the design of our incentive compensation programs that resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain equity incentive awards that we do not expect to repeat. We supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of these changes. We believe excluding the impacts of such changes allows users of our financial statements to more appropriately identify underlying growth trends in compensation and benefits expense.Long-lived Asset Estimated Residual Value ChangesDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined to retire six of our existing MD-11 aircraft from operational use in 2023. In connection therewith, we incurred a one-time, non-cash charge resulting from a reduction in the estimated residual value of our MD-11 fleet. We supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of this charge. We believe excluding the impact of this charge better enables users of our financial statements to understand the ongoing cost associated with our long-lived assets.Transformation and Other ChargesAdjusted EBITDA, operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share may exclude the impact of charges related to transformation activities, goodwill and asset impairments, and divestitures. We believe excluding the impact of these charges better enables users of our financial statements to view underlying business performance from the same perspective as management. We do not consider these costs when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards.Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Gains and LossesWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan curtailments and settlements, for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of Investment income (expense) and other in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these defined benefit plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.The deferred income tax effects of pension and postretirement adjustments are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, by the adjustments.Free Cash FlowWe calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated by our ongoing business operations and we use this as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners.Adjusted Return on Invested CapitalAdjusted ROIC is calculated as the trailing twelve months (""TTM"") of adjusted operating income divided by the average of total debt, non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations and shareowners’ equity, at the current period end and the corresponding period end of the prior year. Because adjusted ROIC is not a measure defined by GAAP, we calculate it, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are most indicative of our ongoing business performance. We consider adjusted ROIC to be a useful measure for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of our long-term capital investments.Adjusted Total Debt / Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted total debt is defined as our long-term debt and finance leases, including current maturities, plus non-current pension and postretirement benefit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the impacts of incentive compensation program redesign, transformation and other costs, defined benefit plan gains and losses and other income. We believe the ratio of adjusted total debt to adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of our financial strength, and is a ratio used by third parties when evaluating the level of our indebtedness.Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Income Statement Items(in millions, except per share data):Three Months Ended December 31, 2022As Reported(GAAP)Pension Adj.(1)IncentiveCompensationDesign Adj.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Thank you. Please go ahead.Kerri Bernstein: Thank you, Donna and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&amp;A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.Steve Squeri: Thanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. It's great to be with you to talk about our 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. As I go through our results, I will tell you why they strengthened my confidence in our plan to generate strong growth over the long-term. A year ago, we introduced our growth plan, which provided a roadmap for delivering annual growth rates for revenue and earnings per share at levels that are higher than the strong growth rates we were delivering before the pandemic. Our results over the last four quarters demonstrate that our strategy is clearly working. We exceeded the full year guidance we laid out in our growth plan for both revenues and EPS and we did so against the mixed economic environment.Story continuesRevenues, which reached all-time highs for both the quarter and the year, were up 25% for the full year, exceeding the 18% to 20% guidance we started the year with. An earnings per share of $9.85 was well above our guidance of $9.25 to $9.65. The momentum we saw through the year in Card Member spending, engagement and retention continued in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter billed business reached a record quarterly high of $357 billion and was up 25% for the full year demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high spending premium card members. Customer retention and satisfaction remained very strong. In addition to strong internal metrics, we were recognized once again by our customers for providing industry best products and services, ranking number one in customer satisfaction in both the 2022 J.D. Power U.S. consumer credit card study and the U.S. small business card study.The investments we have made in our value propositions continue to attract large numbers of new premium customers. We acquired 3 million new card members in the fourth quarter even as we increased our already high credit thresholds through the year. For the full year, new card acquisitions reached a record level, growing at $12.5 million and nearly 70% of our new accounts acquired are on our fee-based products. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to be the largest drivers of our growth, representing over 60% of proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter and for the full year. Credit metrics remained strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our exceptional risk management capabilities and the thoughtful risk actions we have taken for the year.Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, let me tell you why these results increase my confidence that we are positioned to deliver on our growth plan aspirations. First, we are in a great business. We operate in the most attractive segments and geographies of the fast growing payment space. As highlighted by our leadership positions with premium consumers, including millennials and Gen Zers small and medium-sized businesses as well as serving the largest corporations in the world. We bring to this space a number of advantages that are very difficult for our competitors to replicate. These include our brand, our unique membership model, a premium global customer base and an integrated payments model. Forming the foundation of these advantages is our talented dedicated colleagues who deliver unparalleled service to our customers.Put together, the marketplace opportunities we see and the competitive advantages we can leverage create a long runway for growth. We intend to capture these opportunities and building our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas, continuously innovating our consumer and SME products, refining our powerful marketing and risk management engines and capturing our fair share of lending. Growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the U.S. and expanding partnerships to drive customer value across the enterprise, continuing to introduce new digital capabilities that deliver seamless, intuitive customer experiences in their channels of choice and expanding into adjacencies that reinforce our core, such as new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and SMEs, which adds more value to our membership model.All this investment happens while continually focused on gaining efficiencies in our marketing and operating expenses. As we have demonstrated consistently over the past 2 years, executing this investment strategy builds scale, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, it starts with a high spending, highly engaged premium customer base. These premium customers attract a growing network of merchants and partners who add more value to our membership model, which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers who attract more merchants and partners, which creates more scale. This scale enables us to generate more investment and operating efficiencies in our membership model making it more difficult for our competitors to catch up. So what does this mean for 2023?Our plan for this year is built on continuing our investment strategy in the areas I mentioned while factoring in the blue-chip economic consensus for slowing macroeconomic growth. And as always, we have plans in place to pivot should the economic environment change dramatically. This translates into 2023 guidance consistent with what we originally laid out in our growth plan last year. Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, which is higher than our long-term growth plan aspirations and EPS of $11 to $11.40. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.60 a share, up from $0.52 beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. To sum up, our 2022 performance shows that our strategy is working.And based on our performance to-date and what we see for 2023, I am even more confident in our ability to achieve our aspirations for double-digit annual revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Jeff to provide more detail about our performance. As always, we will have a Q&amp;A session after Jeff's remarks.Jeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 22 results, which reflects steady progress against our multiyear growth plan that we announced last January and also to talk about what our 2022 results mean for 2023. I will also spend some of our time this morning focusing on our full year trends since it is year-end and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we actually run the company. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2, full year revenues reached an all-time high of $52.9 billion, up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Notably, our fourth quarter revenues of $14.1 billion also reached a record high for the third straight quarter and grew 19% on an FX adjusted basis.This revenue momentum drove reported full year net income of $7.5 billion and earnings per share of $9.85. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.07, which did include a $234 million impact from our net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. As I have said throughout the year, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the sizable credit reserve releases we had in 2021. Because of these prior year reserve releases, we have also included pre-tax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pre-tax, pre-provision income was $11.8 billion for the full year and $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 27% and 23% respectively versus the prior year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings.So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, beginning with volumes, starting on Slide 3, we saw good quarter-over-quarter growth in volumes. I would note that we reached record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Total network volumes in billed business were up 16% and 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% and 25% for the full year, all on an FX-adjusted basis. Now of course, growth rates for quarters earlier in the year included more of a recovery on the lower levels of volumes in 2021. And we are now to the point where we have lapped the majority of this recovery. We are pleased with this growth and the fact that it is being driven across customer types and geographies.On Slides 4 through 7, we have given you a variety of views across our U.S. consumer services, commercial services and International Card Services segments and the various customer types within each. There is a few key points I suggest you take away from these various perspectives. Starting with our largest segment, U.S. consumer billings grew 15% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumers. Our focus on attracting, engaging and retaining younger cohorts of card members through our value propositions, drove the 30% growth in spending from our millennial and Gen Z customers on Slide 5, who you can now see make up 30% of spend within the segment. Turning to Commercial Services, you see that spending from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers represents the majority of our billings in the segment, supported by our strategic focus on expanding our range of products to help our SME clients run their businesses.Credit card, Gift cardPhoto by Foodguide App on UnsplashWe saw another quarter of solid growth in U.S. SME, though you can see that it was the slowest growing customer type this quarter, up 80% year-over-year. As you heard Steve talk about a bit last month at an investor conference, our SMEs have recently started to slow down spending in service categories such as digital advertising, so we continue to monitor spending trends. Moving to our U.S. large and global corporate customers, the one small customer type that has not come back to pre-pandemic spend levels, they did continue though their steady recovery this quarter with overall billings now 11% below pre-pandemic levels. And lastly, you see our highest growth in international card services as this segment is now in a steep recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments.Spending from international consumer and international SME and large corporate customers grew 23% and 32% year-over-year respectively in Q4. Across all customer types, T&amp;E spending momentum remained particularly strong in the fourth quarter. While we also saw a nice sequential growth in the amount of goods and services spending versus last quarter, so there were a few pockets that slowed, such as the digital advertising spend in SME that I mentioned earlier. So what do all of these takeaways mean for 2023? At this point, on a dollar basis, most of our spending categories have fully recovered. So I would expect more stable growth rates this year across spending categories with the exception that year-over-year growth rates for T&amp;E spending will likely be elevated in Q1 as we lap the impact of Omicron from the prior year.Importantly, all of the things that Steve just talked about that make up the strategy underlying our growth plan have created a foundation for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic. Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8, we saw year-over-year growth of 24% in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth. This loan growth is now exceeding our spend growth as customers steadily rebuild their balances. Given the volumes, of course, have now lapped, there is deep phase of recovery, we do expect the growth rate of our loan balances to moderate as we progress through 2023, but to remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances, which surpassed 2019 levels last quarter also continues to consistently rebuild with over 70% of year-over-year growth in the U.S. coming from our existing customers, which is about 10 percentage points more than what we saw in the years leading up to the pandemic.As you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. So they did continue to pick up this quarter as we expected, which you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, we expect delinquency and write-off rates to continue to move up over time, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023 for Card Member loans. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10 and to this year-end and because the pandemic has clearly impacted the timing of quarterly reserve build and release adjustments across the industry, I think it's helpful to look at our full year provision results.Full year 2022 provision expense was $2.2 billion, which included a $617 million reserve build, primarily driven by loan growth, the continued steady and expected increase in delinquency rates and changes in the macroeconomic outlook as the year progressed. The $2.2 billion number is of course still unusually low by historical standards relative to the size of our loan balances and card member receivables. Of the full year $617 million reserve build, we saw $492 million of it in the fourth quarter. Since earlier this year, we were still releasing a significant amount of the credit reserves we have built to capture the uncertainty of the pandemic. At this point, we no longer have any of these pandemic-driven reserves remaining on our balance sheet.Moving to reserves on Slide 11, you can see that we ended 2022 with $4 billion of reserves, representing 2.4% of our total loans in Card Member receivables. This reserve rate is about 50 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio and the strong credit performance we have seen. We view this consolidated reserve rate as more comparable to day 1 CECL than the individual loans and receivables rates. Because as we talked a bit last quarter, our charge products in many instances now have some embedded lending functionality. We expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels. Taking all of this into account, in 2023, you should expect to see provision expense move back towards more of a steady state relative to the size of our loan balances and Card Member receivables for the first time since we adopted CECL in early 2020.Given the combination of our strong loan growth and the unusually low level by historical standards of provision expense in 2022, I would expect a significant year-over-year increase in provision expense. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12, total revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 25% for the full year. This is well above our original expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategy and is part of which strengthens our confidence in our long-term aspirations. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that you see a 200 basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth and reported revenue growth for this quarter. While this is less of an impact from the strong dollar than what we saw in the prior quarter, it does remain a modest headwind.Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q4 and 27% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 13, this growth is primarily driven by the momentum seen in our spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fee revenues continued to accelerate throughout this year, up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 14. In 2023, I expect net card fees to be our fastest growing revenue line. I would expect growth to moderate from the extremely high level we saw this quarter. This steady growth is powered by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investments we have made in our premium value propositions, as Steve discussed earlier, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Card members and U.S. business Platinum Card members, all reaching record highs in 2022.Moving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year in Q4 and 28% for the year on an FX-adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. The rising interest rate environment has had a fairly neutral impact on our results in 22 as deposit betas lagged the rapid and steep benchmark rate increases during the year. However, when you think about 2023, deposit betas are now in line with more historical levels. So I would expect the year-over-year impact from rising rates to represent more of a headwind in 2023. To sum up on revenues, we are seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum. Looking forward into 2023, we expect to see revenue growth of 15% to 17%. Now all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we have made in those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17.Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs, as you see on Slide 17, came in at 42% total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year. Based off the Q4 exit rates, combined with our continued focus on investing to innovate our products, I would expect variable customer engagement costs to approach 43% of total revenues in 2023. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion in the full year. As a reminder, our marketing dollars mostly represent the things we do to directly drive the great customer acquisition results we are seeing. As we look forward, we remain focused on driving efficiency so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues as we did for many years prior to the pandemic.As a result in 2023, we expect to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to 2022. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter and $13.7 billion for full year 22. In understanding our OpEx results, it's important to note the net mark-to-market impact to our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio that I mentioned earlier with reference to Q4. These gains and losses are reported in the OpEx line and totaled $302 million in losses for full year 2022, while in the prior year, we had a $767 million benefit in net gains. Even putting this aside, as Steve and I have discussed all year, our 2022 operating expenses do represent a step function increase compared to prior years as we have invested in key underpinnings to support our revenue growth and this inflation has had some impact on our expenses.Moving forward, similar to marketing, we are focused on gaining efficiencies and getting back to the low levels of growth in OpEx that we have historically seen. For 2023, we expect operating expenses to be around $14 billion and see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to the high level of revenue growth in our growth plan. Last, our effective tax rate for full year 2022 was around 22%. Our best estimate of the effective tax rate in 2023 is between 23% to 24%, absent any legislative changes. Turning next to capital, on Slide 18, we returned $4.9 billion in capital to our shareholders in 2022, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter with $639 million of common stock repurchases and $389 billion in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation.We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.3% within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 23, as Steve discussed, we do expect to increase our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend decline with earnings and our 20% to 25% target payout ratio. We will continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth going forward. That then brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 19. 2022 was a strong year where we exceeded our full year guidance that we laid out in our growth plan last January for both the revenues and EPS. These results have strengthened our confidence in our 2023 guidance. First and most importantly, we expect the strategies that Steve laid out earlier to deliver continued high levels of revenue growth, leading to our revenue growth guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% and setting us up well for 2024 and beyond.As you think about the drivers of EPS growth in 2023, first, we expect to return to the low levels of growth we have historically driven in our marketing and operating expenses producing some nice leverage. Going the other driver, the two notable headwinds that should be just 2023 challenges are around the year-over-year impacts of provision and of interest rates, as I discussed earlier. Combining all of these factors together, it leads to our EPS guidance of $11 to $11.40 for 2023. There is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But as Steve discussed, our 2023 guidance factors in the blue-chip macroeconomic consensus, which is for slowing growth though not a significant recession. I'd also say that our guidance is based on what we are actually seeing in terms of behavior from our customers around the globe.And of course, it reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. We feel good about the momentum we see in our business and in any environment, remain committed to running the company with a focus on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond as we get to a more steady-state macro environment. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.Kerri Bernstein: Thank you, Jeff. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions.

During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs.

COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

371,61cdd91f-a25d-3a8f-ac7e-8fd6fa0ed18d,ZBH,2023-01-31,BellRing Brands (BRBR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bellring-brands-brbr-reports-next-150003693.html,1675090803,STORY,"['BRBR', 'ZBH']","[BellRing Brands (BRBR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis nutritional supplements company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8%.Revenues are expected to be $342.11 million, up 11.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.82% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BellRing Brands?For BellRing Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that BellRing Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BellRing Brands would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of +6.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.BellRing Brands doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsZimmer Biomet (ZBH), another stock in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.83 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.76 billion, down 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Zimmer has been revised 0.1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.37%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Zimmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, our actual results may differ.Story continuesPlease review our SEC filings for a complete discussion of the risk factors that could affect our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.Mick Farrell: Thanks Amy and Kevin and thank you to all of our stakeholders for joining us today as we review results for the December quarter, our second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our financial results reflect solid performance across our entire business, once again driven by strong sales growth in the Americas region as we were able to significantly increase both production and delivery of flow-generated devices. We're seeing ongoing high demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices worldwide and we're making steady progress, working with our suppliers to continue to increase our production to ultimately meet the needs of all customers and especially patients. Our mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness of the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health.Resupply programs in the US continue to drive solid, ongoing sustained market mask growth catalyzed somewhat by the end of calendar year deductible momentum in the US geography. Masks sales across Europe, Asia, and the rest of world also improved, driven by increased new patient setups as connected device supply increased. Our teams worked incredibly hard to achieve these extraordinary numbers in the face of an ongoing industry supply chain constrained market. We see the supply environment improving every week, every month, and every quarter, and our access to the specific electronic components we need has increased. We are confident in our ability to fulfill all customer demand before the end of calendar year 2023 and we expect to see steady ongoing incremental device revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 2023.Customer acceptance of our reengineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device remains strong during the second quarter, particularly in the United States geography. As we increase the volume of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices over the next few quarters, we will be able to phase out the AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device and refocus on our strategy which is based around the growth of 100% cloud connectable devices across the globe. Outside the US, we have not seen the same adoption rates of that AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud Device. However, there have been pockets of success in some geographies and we see a strong growth path going forward as we ramp up our fully connected AirSense 10 and our fully connected AirSense 11 products and as we achieve regulatory clearance of the latter platform market-by-market.To that point, we introduced our newest product, the AirSense 11 platform into the Japanese market during December and we looked forward to continuing to support doctors and patients in Japan with our world leading 100% cloud connectable medical devices and our cloud-based software technology. Our number one priority across all of our markets will always be patients, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, COPD, respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disease, asthma, and all those who need access to out-of-hospital health care. Our goal is to ensure that patients get the care that they need, where they need it, and when they need it. Let's now briefly review updates on ResMed's top three strategic priorities.Number one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses; number two, to design, develop and deliver market-leading medical devices as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; number three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in a patient's own home. The launch and acceptance of our AirSense 11 device platform continues to go very well. Patient feedback remains very positive and we continue to see very strong adoption of our myAir patient app. In fact, adoption rates are at more than double the adoption rate of myAir with the AirSense 10 platform at about 55% of all patients getting their data every day on their myAir app.Increasing production and delivery of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for our RedMedians around the globe and we will continue to achieve better results and stronger market penetration each quarter. Earlier this month, we were able to take our AirSense 10 fully connected device off allocation in the US market. This is a very exciting development for our commercial team here in the Americas and for all of our customers. We look forward to continuing to expand the supply of fully connected AirSense 10 and fully connected AirSense 11 devices, so that supply can become unconstrained in all countries, but we will progress the throughout fiscal 2023 on this endeavor. An important aspect of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to reach hundreds of millions of patients with our respiratory care solutions, including non-invasive ventilation, and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud connected pharmaceutical delivery solutions and home-based high flow therapy solutions.We are continuing to drive growth and adoption of our ventilator devices around the world and we saw good uptake of both our life support and our non-life support ventilator platforms during the quarter. There is also ongoing adoption of Propeller's monitoring system. Its digital therapeutic platform is now integrated with the two leading US electronic health record systems Epic and Cerner. This digital health integration makes it easier for doctors and healthcare workers to onboard people to the Propeller platform. It's still early days for this technology, however, combined with our investments in home based high flow therapy for treatment of COPD in the home, we see this technology combination as an important clinical addition for treating lung disease and an integral part -- an important part of our 2025 growth strategy.Turning to our Software-as-a-Service offerings for outside hospital care, our SaaS fast business grew 18% year-over-year. This extraordinary growth includes sustained high single-digit organic growth of our US-based SaaS business at around 7% and is accelerated by the addition of approximately six weeks of MediFoxDarn revenue as we close that acquisition and welcomed that German team into the ResMed family of SaaS solutions just over midway through the December quarter. We continue to grow with outside hospital care customers as they increase their utilization of our software and data solutions to improve and optimize business efficiencies and patient care. As opposed to COVID patients' census continues to improve in our facilities verticals, we are seeing pent-up demand for technology investments that continue to come to the market.Our HME SaaS business under the Brightree brand continues to grow at a very rapid pace and we welcome tech solutions for our HME customers across the US market. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, we received final regulatory approval and closed our acquisition of MediFoxDarn, the leading provider of end-to-end software solutions for nursing homes and home health customers in Germany. We're now focused on integrating and growing this business as we accelerate SaaS innovation and SaaS growth in Germany and beyond. I've met in-person with many of the key leaders of the MediFoxDarn team and I can tell you, I'm excited about the cultural fit, the technology focus, the sharing and learning opportunities that they bring and we bring to our global SaaS team.This is our first investment in an outside hospital software business beyond the US market, but I can tell you, the global SaaS team is very much in sync and they have come out of the grade strongly not just in the revenue growth I just talked about, but also in the soft side, team collaboration, transparency, beyond. We look forward to updating you as we achieve key milestones in that business over the quarters and years ahead. Our team is ready to deliver. Our SaaS business is an important part of ResMed's future growth and complements the incredibly strong software and device solutions that we haven't had core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. One great example of the synergies between our SaaS business and our core business is the success of the Brightree ReSupply program.Brightree ReSupply automates the entire process from contacting the patient, interacting with the insurance company on coverage, and interacting directly with the patient and co-pays as well as managing the logistics and distribution process. The ultimate goal is to keep a CPAP, APAP available therapy user replenished with the supplies that they need to enable a better and longer lasting therapy experience. We have published clinical data that show that a patient on a ReSupply program has higher adherence to therapy and we also have peer reviewed published data in chest showing, it was called the ALASKA study that there is a 39% reduction in mortality for patients who are adherent to CPAP versus control. These are incredible data and they lead to these synergies not just being a good revenue opportunity, but being an incredible cost-saving opportunity for the healthcare system and life-saving opportunity for the patients involved.Hospital, Diagnosis, TreatmentPhoto by Marcel Scholte on UnsplashWe will continue to identify and capitalize on synergy opportunities as we move forward. We are well-positioned as the leading global strategic provider of SaaS solutions for out-of-hospital care globally, and we have created differentiated value for customers and long term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. We are transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across our business. We now have over 13.5 billion nights of medical data in the cloud and over 19 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide. We are liberating data to the cloud every day and unlocking value for patients, providers, physicians, payers, and entire health care systems and communities.We are leading the industry, but I see this as just the start of the digital health marathon. And I can tell you, we love the race. As the overlap between digital health and consumer tech industries continues, it is important to note that ResMed's chief medical officer Dr. Carlos Nunez was recently named Chair of the Board of the Health Division of the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA, and the Health Division is the fastest growing division within CTA. The Health Division focuses on consumer-based technology-enabled health solutions to deliver better health outcomes for patients and reduce overall healthcare costs for the healthcare system. Their mission is fully aligned with our ResMed mission, and I'm delighted to see Carlos be recognized for his leadership and the sessions that he chaired at CES in Vegas a couple of weeks ago, show that ResMed's thought leadership and Carlos' thought leadership is helping to craft the future of digital health and bring it to consumers as we have done over the past decade.We're excited about the ways Carlos and CTA's Health Division can help continue to shape our industry for the future, lowering costs, and improving outcomes, and engaging consumers in their own health care. ResMed's mission and clear goal is to improve 250 million lives through better health care in 2025. This patient-centric mission drives and motivates ResMedians every day. We made excellent progress towards that inspiring goal over the last period. During the last 12 months, we improved over 149 million lives with delivery of a device platform to a patient, a full mask system to a patient, or a digital health software solution, helping people to sleep better, to breathe better, and to live higher quality lives with healthcare delivered right where they live, and mostly, in their own home.Before I close, I want to once again express my sincere gratitude to more than 10,000 ResMedians now for their perseverance, hard work, and dedication both today and every day. Thank you. With that I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney, and then we will move and open up for Q&amp;A from the group. Brett over to you.Brett Sandercock: Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Unless noted, all comparisons are to the prior year quarter. We had strong financial performance in Q2. Group revenue was $1.03 billion, an increase of 16%. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 20%. Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep products across our portfolio and ongoing increase device demand generated by our competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign currencies, in particular, the weaker euro negatively impacted revenue by approximately $36 million this quarter. As mentioned, we closed the MediFoxDarn acquisition on November 21, 2022 and accordingly, we have recognized MediFoxDarn revenue of $10.7 million in our Q2 FY 2023 results from this date.While we continue to experience ongoing challenges in securing sufficient electronic components to meet market demand, we are now seeing a more predictable and improving supply chain environment. We expect to continue to deliver sequentially higher quarterly device revenue through the balance of fiscal year 2023. Looking at geographic revenue distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, sales in US, Canada, and Latin America countries increased by 26%. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% in constant currency terms. By product segment, globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 25%, while masks and others sales increased by 13%. Breaking it down by regional areas, device sales in the US, Canada, and Latin America increased by 41% as we benefited from incremental revenue derived from the introduction of the Card-to-Cloud device and improving availability of our connected devices.Masks and other sales increased by 11%, reflecting solid ReSupply revenue. In Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales increased by 5% in constant currency terms, reflecting the ongoing supply constraints in those markets for our connected devices. Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 14% in constant currency terms. Software-as-a-Service revenue, including revenue from our MediFoxDarn acquisition increased by 18% in the December quarter, driven by continued strong performance from our HME vertical. On an organic basis, SaaS revenue grew by 7% in the December quarter. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.Gross margins declined by 80 basis points to 56.8% in the December quarter. The decrease is predominantly attributable to product mix years due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices. Moving on to operating expenses, SG&amp;A expenses for the second quarter increased by 14%, or in constant currency terms increased by 20%. The increase was predominantly attributable to increases in employee related costs, additional expenses related to our acquisitions, and travel and entertainment expenses. SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue was 20.5% compared to the 20.7% were recorded in the prior year period. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% for the balance of fiscal year 2023.R&amp;D expenses for the quarter increased by 4%, or in constant currency terms, increased by 15%. R&amp;D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&amp;D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14%, underpinned by strong revenue growth, partially offset by lower gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 18.3% compared to the prior year quarter rates of 15.6%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of 19% to 21%. Our net income for the December quarter increased by 13% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share also increased by 13%.Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $129 million, reflecting solid underlying earnings, partially offset by higher levels of working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $27 million, depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $38 million. We recorded equity losses of $3.1 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the Primasun joint venture with Verily. We expect to record equity losses of approximately $3 million per quarter through the balance of fiscal year 2023 associated with the joint venture operation. On November 21, 2022, we completed our acquisition of MediFoxDarn for consideration of $997 million and this was funded through a drawdown on our existing revolver credit facility.During the quarter, we recorded acquisition related expenses of $8.4 million associated with the MediFoxDarn acquisition. The acquisition was EPS neutral on a non-GAAP basis in Q2, when we expect the acquisition to be mildly accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of FY 2023. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $253 million. At December 31, we had $1.8 billion in gross debt and $1.5 billion in net debt, reflecting the funding of our MediFoxDarn acquisition. At December 31, we had approximately $390 million available for drawdown under our fleet revolver facility and we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position. Following the acquisition of MediFoxDarn, our net interest expense is expected to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter for the second half of fiscal year 2023, reflecting our increased debt position.Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share. Going forward, we plan to continue to reinvest in growth through R&amp;D and also expect to continue to fund at future tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.Amy Wakeham: Great, thanks, Brett and thanks Mick.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Boston Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Eric Francis Thepaut, for US$848k worth of shares, at about US$40.99 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$45.81. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 22% of Eric Francis Thepaut's holding.Insiders in Boston Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Boston Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Boston Scientific shares. In total, insiders dumped US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Boston ScientificLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Boston Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$158m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Boston Scientific Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for Boston Scientific (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.But note: Boston Scientific may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip this part and go to Top 5 Lowest P/E Ratios of the S&amp;P 500.US equities were hammered in 2022 amid the broader market downturn, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s rate-hike spree. However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Aflac (AFL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 two days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.21 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Aflac has an Earnings ESP of 1.29%.AFL is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Capital One (COF) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Capital One is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 25, 2023.

But according to legendary investor Jeremy Grantham, that’s not going to be the case.In a letter titled After a Timeout, Back to the Meat Grinder, Grantham predicts that the market tumble is far from being done.“My calculations of trendline value of the S&amp;P 500, adjusted upwards for trendline growth and for expected inflation, is about 3200 by the end of 2023,” he writes.Considering that the benchmark index currently sits at 4,066, Grantham’s price target implies a potential downside of 21%.But that’s not all.“Regrettably there are more downside potentials than upside.

Due to last year’s market rout, a lot of stocks are already in correction territory. If the market continues to plunge, many investors’ portfolios will be deep in the red.Grantham is the co-founder and investment chief at asset management firm Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Co. Given his gloomy forecast, let’s take a look at a few safe-haven stocks in GMO’s portfolio.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Story continuesAdd solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.More impressively, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 60 consecutive years. The stock currently yields 2.9%.According to GMO’s latest 13F filing to the SEC, the asset manager owned 5.89 million shares of Coca-Cola at the end of September 2022, valued at $329.83 million.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors throughout economic cycles.Many of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead.

JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase last April and now yields 2.7%.As of Sept. 30, 2022, GMO held 3.00 million shares of JNJ, worth approximately $490.49 million at the time.U.S. Bancorp (USB)Rounding out the list is U.S. Bancorp, the parent company of U.S. bank and one of the largest banking institutions in the country.The banking industry isn’t quite as shockproof as consumer staples or healthcare. But interest rates are on the rise, and that could serve as a tailwind for banks.Banks lend money out at higher interest rates than they borrow, pocketing the difference. As interest rates increase, the spread earned by banks widens.To tame spiking inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points in December, marking its seventh rate hike for the year.In September, the bank increased its quarterly cash dividend from 46 cents to 48 cents per share.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Coca-Cola Consolidated's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Consolidated is:32% = US$331m ÷ US$1.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.32 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Coca-Cola Consolidated's Earnings Growth And 32% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Coca-Cola Consolidated has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 16% which is quite remarkable. As a result, Coca-Cola Consolidated's exceptional 45% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Coca-Cola Consolidated's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Coca-Cola Consolidated's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Coca-Cola Consolidated Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Coca-Cola Consolidated has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 4.7%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Coca-Cola Consolidated has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Coca-Cola Consolidated's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin.Andy Taylor: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.Devin Stockfish: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $1.9 billion or $2.53 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full-year 2022 earnings totaled $2.2 billion or $3.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $11 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding an after-tax charge of $160 million for the special items, we earned $171 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $369 million. This is a 37% decrease from the third quarter and was largely driven by further softening in Wood Products markets as cautious sentiment continued to weigh on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook.Story continuesI'll begin this morning by expressing my appreciation to our employees for their strong execution and performance in 2022. Notwithstanding a number of supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions over the course of the year, our teams operated safely, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful improvements across our businesses. Through their efforts, we delivered our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA on record and are well positioned to navigate a more challenged market environment entering 2023. Additionally, as highlighted on page 20 of our earning slides, we generated more than $2.3 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2022, again demonstrating the strong cash generation capability in combining our unmatched portfolio of assets with industry-leading operating performance.We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on February 27th to holders of record on February 15th. When combined with our quarterly base dividends of $0.72 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $1.62 per share. Including $550 million of shares repurchase during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $1.75 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2022 results, or 75% of 2022 adjusted FAD, which is in line with our annual targeted payout range of 75% to 80%. As summarized on page 21, we've now completed the second full year of our new cash return framework. Upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned more than $3.8 billion in total cash to shareholders based on 2021 and 2022 results, through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchase.We continue to believe this framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a range of market conditions and deliver an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders. Moving forward into 2023, our cash return commitment will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend, which we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025. As outlined in our cash return framework on page 19, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash, as appropriate, to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. And as demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend, or opportunistic share repurchase.With that, I'll now turn to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $86 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $150 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the third quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales realizations in the West. For the full year, Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% compared to 2021. These were strong results, and I am extremely proud of the focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams in 2022. Turning to our western Timberlands operations. Domestic log market softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower lumber pricing and ample log supply in the system. This drove domestic log pricing to lower levels early in the quarter.As the quarter progressed, log supply into the market became more constrained, resulting from a seasonal reduction in log availability. This dynamic resulted in a temporary period of log price stability into December. For the quarter, our average domestic realizations were moderately lower than the third quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were higher, as the business quickly returned to full run rate operations following the resolution of our work stoppage. We plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume from the work stoppage in 2023. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower compared to the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs were comparable. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs was strong in the fourth quarter as our key customers sought to replenish lean inventories resulting from our work stoppage.That said, our export sales volumes to Japan were slightly lower as work stoppage related impacts to our export program were disproportionately higher in the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower as broader log market softened in Japan, due primarily to an oversupply of European lumber imports, as well as lower consumption driven by reduced housing activity. Log demand from our China customers was solid in the fourth quarter, and our export sales volumes increased significantly compared to the lower levels in the third quarter, when we intentionally kept more volume in the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower in the fourth quarter, as broader Chinese log markets softened due to lower consumption resulting from COVID disruptions and challenges in the Chinese real estate market.Moving to the south. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Similar to the last several quarters, notwithstanding adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, southern sawlog and fiber markets remained fairly stable during the fourth quarter. Log demand was steady as mills continued to carry higher inventory levels to mitigate potential risks from supply chain and weather challenges. As a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were slightly higher as weather conditions remained generally favorable for most of the quarter. Forestry and road costs decreased slightly, and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter.On the export side, our southern program to China remains paused due to ongoing phytosanitary rules imposed by Chinese regulators. While it's unclear when this issue will be resolved, we continue to have a positive longer term outlook for our southern export business to China. And in the interim, we will continue to grow our export business into India and other Asian markets. In the north, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter, due to significantly higher sales volumes as weather conditions were favorable. Our sales realizations decreased moderately. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $329 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance, and 11% higher than 2021.This was driven primarily by exceptionally strong demand for HBU properties in 2022 as well as robust energy and natural resources activity for much of the year. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $24 million to earnings. Excluding a $10 million noncash impairment charge, resulting from the planned divestiture of legacy coal assets, the segment earned $34 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, a decrease of $14 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold. Although HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns, we continue to see steady interest from buyers seeking the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment. Notably, we delivered our highest average price per acre for all of 2022 on our land sales in the fourth quarter.These are high value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on page 13, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business was $43 million, a 13% increase compared to 2021. Growth during the year was primarily driven by conservation activity, with ongoing contributions from our mitigation banking and renewable energy businesses. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our emerging carbon businesses in 2022, including the announcement of our first two carbon capture and storage agreements, one of which was announced in the fourth quarter in partnership with Denbury. Similar to our agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures announced earlier in 2022, the Denbury project will take several years to begin production, and we expect both projects will come on line in 2025 or 2026.Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers of carbon capture and storage on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future. Turning briefly to forest carbon offsets, we're nearing completion of our pilot project in Maine and expect third-party approval soon. This project serves as a proof of concept for Weyerhaeuser and positions us well to advance additional forest carbon projects in 2023. With these exciting developments, we continue to see multiyear growth potential from our Natural Climate Solutions business and maintain our target of reaching $100 million per year of EBITDA by the end of 2025. Moving to Wood Products on pages 14 through 16. Wood Products contributed $147 million to fourth quarter earnings and $197 million to adjusted EBITDA.Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 50% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by continued softening in Wood Products markets and lower product pricing. For the full year, our Wood Products business generated over $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our engineering Wood Products business established a new annual EBITDA record. Additionally, our distribution business generated the highest annual EBITDA in over 15 years. These are outstanding results, and I'm proud of our team's ability to deliver this level of performance, notwithstanding numerous challenges in 2022. Turning to some commentary on the Lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter showing signs of stabilization after falling for much of the third quarter.As the quarter progressed, both markets exhibited cautious buyer sentiment, resulting from a softening housing market in addition to broader concerns about the economy and inflation. Buyers maintained lean inventories and limited orders to necessity purchases through year-end. This drove benchmark prices lower for both, Lumber and OSB in the fourth quarter. As a result, the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 24% compared to the third quarter and the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. That said, benchmark pricing for both projects -- products stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $80 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 11% in the fourth quarter with relative outperformance compared to the benchmark, resulting primarily from our regional and product mix.Our sales and production volumes decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. These decreases resulted from a combination of the work stoppage-related impacts in the Northwest, adverse weather conditions in December and challenged reliability at several mills during the quarter. As a result, unit manufacturing costs increased significantly during the quarter. Log costs were modestly lower, primarily for western logs. Specific to our Northwest mills, which resumed operations in November following the work stoppage, much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, margins compressed and are expected to remain lower until we work through the higher-cost log inventories and log prices in the Northwest adjust to reflect current lumber pricing levels.Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $47 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter. Production volumes were comparable. However, sales volumes decreased slightly, resulting from weather-related disruption challenge -- weather-related transportation challenges in Canada late in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs decreased moderately and fiber costs were slightly lower in the quarter. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $56 million compared to the third quarter. This result is directly tied to recent softening in demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications.Although we often see demand for Engineered Wood Products slow somewhat during the winter months, the broader slowdown in the housing market in Q4 caused more of a pullback than ordinarily would be the case. As a result of this dynamic, our sales volumes decreased for all products compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were also lower as we elected to take temporary holiday downtime at several EWP facilities during the quarter. Our sales realizations decreased for all products, except for I-joist, which were comparable to the third quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable in the fourth quarter, and raw material costs were moderately lower, primarily for OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $18 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes, primarily for EWP products.Wood, Spray, SprayerPhoto by Simon Kadula on UnsplashWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2023 outlook.Davie Wold: Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on page 18. We generated $167 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $2.8 billion, our second highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results, which includes $550 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $146 million and we have approximately $375 million of remaining capacity under the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in the third quarter of 2021.We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $662 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity, and we ended the year with approximately $5 billion of gross debt. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on page 17. Unallocated adjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO as well as benefits resulting from lower-than-expected health care expenses and increased discount rates on workers' compensation obligations.In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was approximately $420 million of our Canadian pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. The contract purchase was funded from our Canadian pension plan assets with no company cash contribution required. As a result of the transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $205 million noncash pretax settlement charge. This transaction is the latest in the series we have executed to reduce our pension plan obligations. Since we began these efforts in 2018, our pension obligations have decreased from $6.8 billion to $2.3 billion as of year-end 2022. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2023 are presented on pages 23 and 24. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter.Beginning with our Western Timberland operations, domestic log markets entered the first quarter showing continued signs of softening as a result of lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, along with elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved compared to the fourth quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the first quarter, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the first quarter as we have returned to full run rate operations following the work stoppage, which affected one month of operations in the fourth quarter.Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities. Moving to the export markets. Demand for our logs remained steady as customers in Japan and China work to build finished product inventories in preparation for seasonally stronger construction activity in the second quarter. We expect to significantly increase our export sales volumes to both markets compared to the fourth quarter, which was affected by one month of reduced export activity resulting from our work stoppage, but we also expect to shift additional volume to China to take advantage of higher-margin opportunities.That said, our export sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter as broader log markets continue to soften, resulting from the headwinds Devin previously mentioned. In the South, we expect log demand to remain fairly steady in the first quarter, although grade and fiber markets are showing signs of slight softening as we enter 2023, particularly fiber markets in the East. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower due to seasonally wet weather in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs and forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, fee harvest volumes and sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter.Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2023, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35 million tons. In the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be moderately higher than 2022 as we plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volumes resulting from our work stoppage. We expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately compared to 2022 as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels resulting from adverse weather conditions, primarily in the third quarter of 2022. We expect our Northern harvest volumes will be slightly higher year-over-year. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns.That said, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. We expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment. Consistent with previous years, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings before special items are expected to be approximately $10 million higher than the fourth quarter, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $35 million higher, primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.Turning to our Wood Products segment. As Devin mentioned, buyer sentiment remains cautious. That said, benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB have stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter. For lumber, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs as we resumed operations in our Northwest mills following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate improved reliability across the system. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower, primarily for Western logs.For OSB, we expect sales and production volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter due to less planned downtime for annual maintenance and improved transportation networks following extreme winter weather in December. We expect fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs to be lower compared to the fourth quarter. As shown on page 25, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB are both moderately lower than the fourth quarter averages. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect significantly lower sales realizations in the first quarter, resulting from softening demand for EWP products. Sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower for solid section products while I-joist sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher.We anticipate significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to lower margins for all products. I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on page 24. Our full year 2022 interest expense was $270 million. This represents a $43 million reduction from the prior year, largely due to the strategic refinancing transaction we completed in the first quarter of 2022. For full year 2023, we expect interest expense will be unchanged at approximately $270 million. Turning to taxes. Our full year 2022 effective tax rate was approximately 20%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 12% and 14% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.For cash taxes, we paid $566 million for full year 2022, which was slightly higher than our tax expense, excluding special items, due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2023 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2022 funded status improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to higher discount rates compared to year-end 2021. Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense was approximately $50 million in 2022. We expect to record a similar total at approximately $50 million of expense in 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2022 was $24 million. In 2023, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million.Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2022 capital spend totaled $462 million plus $6 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital spend for 2023 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $315 million for Wood Products and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.Devin Stockfish: Thanks, Davie. As we begin to wrap up this morning, I'll make a few brief comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Residential construction activity has clearly softened from the peak levels of 2022, particularly in the single-family segment. As we enter 2023, buyer sentiment remains cautious for new and existing homes and is being driven by numerous ongoing headwinds. Most notable is the affordability challenge brought about by increased mortgage rates, combined with significant increases in home prices over the last two years. In addition, we believe buyer psychology is being influenced by uncertainty related to the trajectory of mortgage rates, general concerns about the economy and falling home prices in many markets.As a result, we anticipate a more challenged housing market compared to the last couple of years, particularly in the first half of 2023. That being said, there are some signs recently that the environment may be improving. Mortgage rates have ticked down from recent highs. Homebuilder sentiment improved in January and mortgage application activity has picked up over the last several weeks. Additionally, the labor market remains fairly strong overall and household balance sheets are generally in good shape. There are still plenty of people who want a home and can still get a mortgage, but many buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until we see some improvements, but at the very least some stabilization in certain macroeconomic and housing-related trends.I will note, however, that despite what may be a period of choppiness in the near term, our longer-term view on the housing fundamentals continue to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel. Activity in the repair and remodel market remained fairly stable in the fourth quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment continued to soften from the elevated levels of the last couple of years and has returned to a more normalized pre-pandemic level. In the near term, we expect stable demand from the repair and remodel segment, albeit perhaps at a slightly lower level than what we've seen over the last couple of years.Looking out beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact and support our more bullish long-term outlook, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. Now, before we move into questions, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2022 against the multiyear targets we set out during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on slide 22, we're progressing well on all fronts. Last year, we deployed approximately $300 million on Timberland acquisitions, including our Carolinas transaction. We grew our Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 13% compared to 2021 and announced our first two carbon capture and storage deals, and we remain on track to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025.Last year, our teams captured approximately $40 million of margin improvements across our businesses and also made meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities. I'm extremely pleased with this result, considering the inflationary pressures we experienced in 2022. We made progress against our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. And finally, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.9% and returning $1.75 billion to shareholders, based on 2022 results. So, in closing, our performance in 2022 reflected solid execution across all of our businesses. Entering 2023, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, we have a competitive cost structure, and we are well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions.We'll remain focused on servicing our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions.See also 12 Most Undervalued Pharma Stocks To Buy and 25 Largest Privately Held Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Increasingly, honest conversations around formerly taboo subjects are the norm. But new data shows that Gen Z’ers would rather talk about politics, parenting struggles, sex and infertility than debt, their salaries and bad investments. In fact, despite their modern lives, they are part of the 55% of Canadians who would rather talk to their children about sex than speak to them about their own finances.Survey data also identified a new trend: ""soft saving"" —the financial spinoff of the boundary-setting ‘soft life’ trend focused on comfort and minimizing stress. Currently taking over TikTok feeds, this philosophy extends to money. A stark departure from the F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, hustle culture and the Girlboss ethos dominating the past decade, Gen Z is embracing ""soft saving."" Three in four Gen Z’ers say they would rather have a better quality of life than extra money in the bank. In fact, experiences matter more than money to Gen Z, as 68% say they are only interested in finances as a means to support their current interests.Gen Z has more access to financial information than any other generation, but this doesn’t always translate into decision-making. From financial tips on TikTok to Reddit forums on investing, the survey illustrates that Gen Z is frequently paralyzed by conflicting advice and could benefit from new ways to save:Story continuesNearly three in four say they know how to make a budget and track their income, but haven’t done it (74%).Nearly three in four know it’s important to invest, but they don’t know how (73%).65% say they have financial knowledge, but are unsure how to use it.Nearly half bought cryptocurrency even though they don’t fully understand blockchain (49%).Two-thirds say they’re not sure they’ll ever have enough money to retire (64%).""The economic shocks of the last few years have transformed how Gen Z views success, and this survey revealed that prosperity means something different to everyone, particularly Zoomers,"" said ​Brittney Castro, Intuit consumer financial advocate. ""At Intuit, we believe that everyone should have the ability to prosper—however they define that for themselves. Intuit is delivering innovative and personalized financial solutions through TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp that our customers need to make more money, save time, and build confidence.""Additional Canadian survey findings include:Quality of life is being held hostage by poor finances, especially for Gen Z, the generation that values quality of life the most. 62% of Gen Z feel like they will never have the things they want in life because of their financial situation.59% of Canadians feel anxious going with friends to restaurants and bars they know they can’t afford (70% for Gen Z).53% of Canadians say giving a gift for a special occasion would put a strain on their monthly finances (67% for Gen Z).Nearly half of Canadians (45%) say they have spent less time with friends or family due to financial constraints (56% for Gen Z).For more information on Intuit and how the company is ​helping its customers make more money, save time, and build confidence when it comes to their personal or business finances​​, visit www.intuit.com/ca.*Statistics from 2022 Intuit survey of 1,500 Canadian consumers ages 18+.

This compares to earnings of $6.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and other appliances would post earnings of $5.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.49, delivering a surprise of -19.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Whirlpool , which belongs to the Zacks Household Appliances industry, posted revenues of $4.92 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.46%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.82 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Whirlpool shares have added about 8.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6%.What's Next for Whirlpool?While Whirlpool has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Whirlpool: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.19 on $4.54 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $15.93 on $18.89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Household Appliances is currently in the bottom 3% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Weber (WEBR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This maker of outdoor cooking equipment is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +66.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Weber's revenues are expected to be $161.08 million, down 43.1% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a look at two names. We have Whirlpool and NXP. It's all about earnings this week. Kicking it off with whirlpool, we're looking at gains here in extended trading, up just about 2%. Some nuggets here from this earnings report, guidance meeting the Street's expectations. They see revenue of 19.4 billion for the year, EPS outlook in line with the Street's estimates as well.A reason why we're seeing the stock pop here in extended trading, I think a lot of that has to do with one line here in this report that the company does expect $800 to $900 million benefit this year in part due to some easing raw material inflation costs here. That, of course, is expected to benefit the company going forward. Intraday basis ahead of these results, the stock closed the trading day lower here over the last three months. We're looking at gains of nearly 10% ahead of this earnings report. The company announced that its president and COO would be leaving the company.All right, let's take a look at NXP Semiconductors, again, a mover here in extended trading. We're looking at losses of nearly 4%. Now the company here, revenue forecasts missing the Street's expectations. That's a huge driver in this extended hours trading activity. Right now, Q4 EPS did beat the Street's expectation, revenue coming in just in line, up about 9% on a year over year basis. But that weak guidance, that is what's dragging the stock lower after-hours. Over the last three months, we're looking at gains of just about 18%. Over the last six months, a bit of a longer term chart there, the stock has essentially been flat off just about 2%. Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: OK, Seana, thank you.]"

INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Millions of dollars except per share data) (Unaudited)We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as ""ongoing"" measures, including earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), EBIT margin, ongoing EBIT, ongoing EBIT margin, ongoing earnings per diluted share, adjusted effective tax rate, organic net sales, return on invested capital (ROIC) and free cash flow. Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that organic net sales provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and divestitures. Management believes that ROIC provides investors with a view of capital efficiency, a key driver of stockholder value creation. Management believes that adjusted tax rate provides investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its forward-looking long-term value creation goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, free cash flow conversion, ROIC and gross debt/EBITDA, as these long-term management goals are not annual guidance, and the reconciliation of these long-term measures would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company's control. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share, net earnings, net earnings available to Whirlpool, net earnings margin, return on assets, net sales, effective tax rate and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also disclose segment EBIT as an important financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting. GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share and ongoing earnings per diluted share are presented net of tax, while individual adjustments in each reconciliation are presented on a pre-tax basis; the income tax impact line item aggregates the tax impact for these adjustments. The tax impact of individual line item adjustments may not foot precisely to the aggregate income tax impact amount, as each line item adjustment may include non-taxable components. Historical quarterly earnings per share amounts are presented based on a normalized tax rate adjustment to reconcile quarterly tax rates to full-year tax rate expectations. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.FOURTH-QUARTER 2022 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHAREThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool and net earnings (loss) per basic share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas industry supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +483.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.95 billion, up 28.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nov Inc.For Nov Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +17.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Nov Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nov Inc. Would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of -46.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nov Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsTrane Technologies (TT), another stock in the Zacks Technology Services industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.64 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +20.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.95 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Trane Technologies has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.09%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Trane Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The [H2] Innovation Experience offers a look at how clean, renewable hydrogen microgrids can reliably power entire neighborhoods, day and night throughout the year. This type of clean hydrogen microgrid has the potential to deliver reliable and renewable energy around-the-clock to more than 100 homes, rain or shine, for as much as seven days.""Innovative projects like the [H2]IE demonstrate how California is leading the clean energy transition,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis. ""This first-of-its-kind project shows how clean renewable hydrogen and microgrids can help power homes, enhance grid reliability, and preserve and grow good-paying union jobs in our state.""""The [H2] Innovation Experience showcases how California can achieve two of its top policy priorities – energy reliability and decarbonization – at the same time,"" said SoCalGas Chief Executive Officer, Scott Drury. ""This innovative project demonstrates how the gas and electric grids – working together – can help California reach net-zero emissions more quickly, affordably, and reliably.""Located at the SoCalGas Energy Resource Center in the city of Downey, the [H2] Innovation Experience is centered around a state-of-the-art microgrid that is producing clean, renewable hydrogen made from solar electricity on-site. The 2,000 square-foot home was built to adhere to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum standards and is powered by reliable and clean, renewable hydrogen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The microgrid draws power from solar panels on sunny days and converts excess energy into renewable hydrogen, which can be stored and then converted back into electricity via an on-site hydrogen fuel cell. Clean, renewable hydrogen will also be blended with natural gas and used in the home's tankless water heater, clothes dryer, stove, fireplace, and BBQ grill.Story continuesIn 2021, the [H2] Innovation Experience received a Fast Company's World-Changing Ideas in North America Award. More recently, the Los Angeles chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council recognized the project for its sustainable innovation.What others are saying about the [H2] Innovation Experience""The [H2]IE makes use of world-class energy infrastructure that UWUA members have built over the past century and brings the promise of fresh opportunities for tens of thousands of UWUA members who operate and maintain our infrastructure every day,"" said James T. Slevin, president of Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO.""California needs labor to meet its ambitious plans to address climate change... and we are here,"" said Aaron Stockwell, international representative with the United Association. ""This project gives us a glimpse of what we can accomplish when ambition and innovation are partnered with our skilled workforce.""""As we work toward achieving California's clean energy goals, hydrogen will play an essential role in meeting future energy demand. The Hydrogen Innovation Experience is an important step in realizing hydrogen's full potential,"" said Ramon Ponce de Leon, Jr., president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 13. ""With green hydrogen, ILWU members at our vital ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach retain their good union jobs operating equipment that is clean, flexible, and cost-effective.""""Small, minority-owned businesses are the backbone of Los Angeles' economy,"" said Gene Hale, chairman of the Greater Los Angeles Chamber African American of Commerce. ""The Los Angeles African American business community is already working to forge more sustainable communities, and we are excited to be a part of innovative projects like the [H2]IE that help bring us closer to that goal.""""For a business like ours that builds critical infrastructure and helps diverse communities across California thrive, hydrogen represents our next infrastructure boom,"" said George Pla, founder and CEO of Cordoba Corporation. ""The [H2]IE is symbolic of what this can look like in everyday lives. California is blessed with vibrant diverse businesses needed to support this next generation of energy infrastructure.""""The [H2]IE has significant positive implications for the future of California's businesses,"" said Jennifer Barrera, president and CEO of CalChamber. ""Our businesses need access to clean and reliable energy. California's business community is enthusiastic about this project and the promise of cleaner technologies that best meet our needs.""Sustainability LeadershipSoCalGas is a leader in sustainability, having been the first large natural gas utility in the United States to announce its aim to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. A key component of its sustainability efforts is Angeles Link, a proposed green hydrogen pipeline system that could deliver clean, reliable, renewable energy to the Los Angeles region.In December, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved SoCalGas' request to track costs for advancing the first phase of the project, which could be the nation's largest green hydrogen pipeline system and support significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electric generation, industrial processes, heavy-duty trucks, and other hard-to-electrify sectors of the Southern California economy. Angeles Link, the [H2] Innovation Experience and more than a dozen hydrogen demonstration projects SoCalGas is currently pioneering, are all part of its ongoing efforts to help accelerate California's energy transition.SoCalGas's sustainability strategy also extends to the more than 500 diverse communities the company serves across California. In 2021, for example, SoCalGas spent nearly $1 billion with more than 570 diverse business enterprises, procuring over 42% of total goods and services from women, minority, service-disabled veteran, LGBT, and small disadvantaged businesses. The company also increased spending with African American vendors by almost 50%. Over the last five years, SoCalGas has spent $3.9 billion with diverse business enterprises.SoCalGas' efforts were recognized in October, when the company was awarded the top ""Business Transformation Award"" at Reuters Events' 2022 Responsible Business Awards for having established truly transformative sustainability priorities with the potential to create impact at scale in the energy sector and beyond.""The [H2] Innovation Experience is just another progression in SoCalGas' evolution as we innovate toward net-zero emissions and leverage our 150-year history, scale, vast infrastructure, and highly skilled workforce to support California's clean air and climate goals,"" Drury added.For more information about the [H2] Hydrogen Experience, visit socalgas.com/h2ie.For B-roll and photos of the [H2] Innovation experience, click here.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Recent Spin-off Companies That Hedge Funds Are Piling Into. A spin-off occurs when a company splits off a portion of its business into a separate company and distributes shares of the new entity tax-free to the parent company's shareholders. The number of shares a shareholder receives is proportional to their holdings in the parent company. In 2022, while the stock market saw a decline and the market for initial public offerings cooled, the activity surrounding corporate spinoffs increased. In various industries, numerous well-known and established companies are spinning off parts of their operations to drive growth, improve returns, and increase shareholder value. Prominent blue-chip companies pursuing spinoffs include General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Spin-off firms typically belong to a separate industry sector compared to the parent company. The parent firm believes that the spin-off can benefit from greater strategic capital allocation, improved ROI, and a more entrepreneurial approach, as it is no longer restricted by the parent company. This allows the parent company to concentrate on its core business with faster growth, and allocate more resources towards it. Some spin-offs occur due to activism, as activists push for change. Another factor contributing to the rise in spin-offs is social proof; as more spin-offs are announced, especially within certain industries, boards of directors and CFOs feel pressure to consider similar actions. For example, in the healthcare industry, significant pressure exists to divide the high-return biotech and pharma businesses from the lower-growth but more stable consumer healthcare operations. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) recently filed a plan to separate its consumer health division, marking the first significant US IPO filing of the year. According to its filing with the SEC on January 4, the spin-off firm Kenvue Inc. will consist of J&amp;J brands such as Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, and Nicorette. The filing comes after a lackluster year for US IPOs, which saw the lowest amount raised since the financial crisis in 2009. After reaching a record high of $339 billion in 2021, the number of IPO listings on US exchanges declined to $24 billion in 2022, as per Bloomberg data. The Kenvue filing could be the major IPO event this year and if it proves successful, it could indicate that the IPO market is recovering from uncertainty, inflation, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. are leading the IPO. Kenvue intends for its shares to be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol KVUE.Story continuesOur Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of holdings of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022 and picked the top 10 companies that were spun off in 2022 and were popular among smart investors. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Recent Spin Off Companies That Hedge Funds Are Piling IntoImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayRecent Spin-off Companies That Hedge Funds Are Piling Into10.

The analyst sees Embecta as a profitable global diabetes company with an established presence, but views it as a story of long-term execution.

(NASDAQ:ZIMV), its former dental and spine division.On December 21, Barclays analyst Matt Miksic started coverage of ZimVie Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIMV) with an Underweight rating and a $9 price target. The stability of the dental business contrasts with the difficulties faced by the spine division, which has suffered double-digit declines in a market growing at a low single digit or remaining flat, according to the analyst. He sees no improvement in the near future. Given the large amount of cash and working capital tied to the spine business, the analyst anticipates ZimVie Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIMV)’s spine losses to persistently weigh on the overall performance of the company.According to Insider Monkey’s data, ZimVie Inc. (NASDAQ:ZIMV) was part of 20 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 16 in the last quarter. ZimVie Inc.

(NASDAQ:ZIMV) sharply declined in the quarter, following a downward revision in full-year guidance. Over the long-term, we believe the foreign exchange headwinds the company is facing will soften and expect the management team to enhance its focus on research and development, as well as expand the product portfolio across its core value chain.”6.

The company expects sales to grow between 5% and 7% for the full year.And we had spoken with the CEO of GE HealthCare on the day that they made their debut into the public markets. And on this report, he said that they delivered strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter and full-year 2022, saying some of the catalysts were robust end-market demand as well as improved pricing and some of the easing supply-chain pressures.BRIAN SOZZI: What I don't like on this quarter-- generally I don't have any problems with this per se. Good top-line growth, but margins-- operating margins down in the imaging, ultrasound, and pharmaceutical diagnostics segments. The only-- really, essentially this quarter was driven by margin gains and patient-care solutions. So right out of the gate, we're seeing some margin pressure on this newly publicly traded company. I'm sure they will get a lot of questions about that on the earnings call.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, and they did report preliminary results earlier in the month, so not necessarily seeing as much of a reaction as we would have.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG) and Infosys Ltd. (INFY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+2.3% vs. -8.0%). The company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. For fiscal 2023, net revenues are estimated to rise in the high single digits on a reported nominal dollar basis.Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. The company beat fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings estimates on the back of steady domestic volumes and a rise in transactions. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line. The company's volumes will likely suffer due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -1.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry’s decline of -2.6%. The company is facing commodity cost inflation, increases in freight costs, and product and packaging investments which threaten margins. The company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023 due to persistent inflation, and higher freight and currency woes.However, Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected top and bottom lines for the second consecutive quarter in its fiscal second quarter. The company’s organic sales improved, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. Driven by the company’s progress against its plans, management has raised its sales view for fiscal 2023.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Infosys have declined -20.8% over the past year against the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry’s decline of -20.4%. The company is suffering from increasing anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries. Higher subcontractor costs and its compensation revision with a higher variable pay and incentives are weighing on margins. Further, unfavorable currency fluctuations remain a major concern.Nevertheless, Infosys is gaining from large deal wins and fast-growing digital services. Its sustained focus on Agile Digital and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Core services is a tailwind. Strong demand for its services in cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, data and analytics are key drivers.Higher investments by clients in digital transformation, AI and automation are an upside. Solid traction of its CobaltTM cloud portfolio is a positive. According to the Zacks analyst estimates, Infosys’ revenues should grow at a CAGR of 9.6% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Infosys here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corp.

Yet, stiff rivalry remains a concern.Solid Performance Across Agility &amp; Reliability Units Aid FlexPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance benefited from strength across the Agility Solutions and Reliability Solutions segments.

However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group What Is UnitedHealth Group's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2022 UnitedHealth Group had debt of US$57.6b, up from US$46.0b in one year. However, it does have US$27.9b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$29.7b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is UnitedHealth Group's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that UnitedHealth Group had liabilities of US$89.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$70.1b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$27.9b as well as receivables valued at US$17.7b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$113.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesThis deficit isn't so bad because UnitedHealth Group is worth a massive US$453.9b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).UnitedHealth Group's net debt is only 0.93 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 13.6 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. And we also note warmly that UnitedHealth Group grew its EBIT by 19% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine UnitedHealth Group's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, UnitedHealth Group generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 85% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that UnitedHealth Group's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like UnitedHealth Group commonly do use debt without problems. Looking at the bigger picture, we think UnitedHealth Group's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.4% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has lost 8.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.3%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.17 indicates a change of +13.1% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $89.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $359.17 billion and $383.77 billion estimates indicate +10.8% and +6.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $82.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $5.34 for the same period compares with $4.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of 0%. The EPS surprise was +3.29%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Stocks That Are Aggressively Buying Back Shares According To Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs US equity strategy chief David Kostin noted in the beginning of November that despite Q3 GDP exceeding expectations, the US economy still appears to be headed towards a recession. During the earnings season, US stocks continued to rise, even though Q3 earnings per share growth was only 2% year-over-year, instead of the expected 3%.Importance of BuybacksWhen a company engages in stock buybacks and is financially stable, it is a positive indication for investors as it shows management's confidence in the company's future and belief that shares are undervalued. This increases returns for existing shareholders as fewer shares in circulation increases the value of each remaining share. However, Kostin observed that although the volume of stock buybacks increased in the third quarter, the amount spent on repurchasing shares has decreased throughout 2022. In Q1, buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 rose by 51% year-over-year and in Q2, they increased by 7% year-over-year.Instead of buybacks, companies are prioritizing R&amp;D and dividends, which are predicted to increase by 10% and 5% year-over-year, respectively, as per Goldman Sachs. Some firms that are aggressively buying back shares according to Goldman Sachs include Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).

The beats were largely driven by strong pricing, which could be hitting record highs, and healthy commodity/coal volume driven by the current energy crisis.”13. Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Its shares appreciated 20.1% during the quarter.During the quarter, LKQ shared its fourth-quarter results: showing a slight revenue decline and a nearly 30% increase in quarterly profit Vs. the same period last year. COVID has proved a surprising catalyst for my investment thesis which revolves around optimizing their recent large acquisitions that were never efficiently integrated.Admittedly, in addition to LKQ’s quarterly performance, thematically, there has been broad enthusiasm for “re-opening” trades, of which, LKQ has been a beneficiary. Most importantly, the prior overhang related to LKQ’s debt burden is now all but behind us. Their net debt to EBITDA ratio now sits below 2x, a stark change from the near 3x leverage ratio before the pandemic. At that time, LKQ’s leverage had the potential to spiral upward to nearly 4-5x if the business experienced a prolonged shutdown. It’s good to be past this issue.”11.

Meanwhile, trade flows have shifted with Russia and Belarus, the second and third largest fertilizer exporters globally, banning exports and facing sanctions imposed by the West.

The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL)Share Price Returns From November 2, 2022 to January 30, 2023: 4.47%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Net Buyback Yield: 11%The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) provides property and casualty insurance products in the United States and Canada. The company operates through Allstate Protection, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Run-off Property-Liability segments.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 847,602 shares worth $105.5 million. Appleseed Fund, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter, and mentioned The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL). Here is what the fund said:“Allstate is the second-largest personal insurance company in the United States with a 9.3% share in auto insurance (4th largest) and an 8.0% share in homeowner’s insurance (2nd largest). The company sells products primarily through its captive agents though this business line is shrinking as the company’s direct (Esurance.com and, more recently, Allstate.com) and independent agent businesses grow more quickly. The personal insurance industry is relatively consolidated, and competition has historically been rational, allowing Allstate to earn attractive mid-teen returns on equity in this business over the past decade. Allstate also recently announced plans to divest their low-growth, low-return life and annuity businesses. This will free up capital to reinvest into the more attractive personal insurance segment and result in improvements on consolidated returns on equity of approximately 2.5%.Despite the attractive industry dynamics of the personal insurance business and the steps that Allstate has taken to dispose of lower return businesses, the company’s stock currently trades as if Allstate will never be able to grow its earnings. At our purchase price, Allstate’s stock was trading for less than 10.0x forward earnings estimates. While Allstate does face tough competition in the auto insurance business from GEICO and Progressive, their market position, strong brand, and increased investment into the direct insurance business should allow them to grow earnings. Overall, we believe this entry price is attractive for an industry leader in a high-return, consolidating industry. Further, downside risk management should be positively impacted by the dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a management team that has historically increased share repurchases when they view the stock to be trading below its intrinsic value.”9.

426,0e8f6c35-1aac-38a8-9675-155ff5ecdb11,PG,2023-01-31,"Consumer staples: P&G saw ‘huge surge in demand’ amid COVID-19, analyst says",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/consumer-staples-p-g-saw-154920704.html,1675093760,VIDEO,['PG'],"[Raymond James Managing Director &amp; Senior Consumer Staples Analyst Olivia Tong joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss key considerations for investing in home and beauty consumer staples, currency inflation, consumer spending, and the outlook for Estée Lauder’s brand portfolio.Video Transcript- The consumer staples sector is facing a difficult start to 2023, down nearly 2% as investors shift away from the space. But our next guest is listing out some key considerations for holding these home and beauty names. Raymond James managing director Olivia Tong joins us now. What is the number one consideration that people should be keeping in mind with regard to these names?OLIVIA TONG: Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. A couple of things to think about-- the most important things I would say from the top line is the mix between price versus volume, so how many units somebody buys versus the price increases that are coming through. And then, on the margin line, on the isoprofit line, it's really around gross margin because the pressures from higher costs and unfavorable currency movements, which you've heard about, they are lingering for longer.So you'll see a little bit more pressure as we kind of move into the next couple of quarters. And then, by the time we get to the second half, you'll see a lot of those cost increases start to lap. So it should get better by second half of the year.- Yeah, Olivia, to your point, I was interested to see it in some of the consumer goods companies we've heard from so far, them talking about that the cost increase-- that their input cost increases are still happening, right-- that they're still trying to cope with that. What should we look for in terms of companies that are still going to have sustainable pricing power as their input costs continue to rise?OLIVIA TONG: Sure, it's a great question. I think a couple of things to think about. First is market shares. So those with the higher market shares, those with a lot of innovation, they can get away with a little bit more pricing, right?Story continuesThey can hold on to a little bit more, and people will be willing to pay a little bit more for some improved efficacy or ease of use or convenience or what have you. But you're right, the pressures from these higher costs and unfavorable effects, they have been lingering for a little bit longer. And on the flip side, what you're seeing also is that a lot of these multinational companies, right-- there's a little bit of a misconnect between where you produce things versus where you sell them, so that magnifies that impact to some extent.- Olivia, you have outperform ratings on Clorox and Procter &amp; Gamel. Does an investor have to own both of those names? Because I would argue, and I'm sure you know this, both of those stories have been very different the past year. P&amp;G execution machine, Clorox just has continued to disappoint investors with earnings.OLIVIA TONG: Yes, for Procter, I mean, going into earnings season, Procter was our top pick in staples. And it's a very important time here in the sector. As you know, I've been focused on this sector for many years. And in this space, we've seen a huge surge in demand during COVID.Some of this demand stays higher because our habits have changed, hybrid work, et cetera, it means more consumption at home. But more importantly, I think for Procter, it's likely one of the earlier ones to see gross margin turn, and we think the fact that it hits multiple price tier points across its most important categories will benefit them through what could be, as you notice, a choppy macro period.Clorox is reporting this week, they're reporting Thursday after the close. This is more of a turnaround story. They had a really challenging time with gross margins last year. So the comp is-- as a lab, those comps, you should start to see some improvement there.- We've heard from all of these companies in one form or another about price normalization. Is there one that's doing the best with that regard?OLIVIA TONG: I think they're all seeing some increase in price, of course. They've been putting those through all through last year and at the beginning of this year. And some are still taking more price in order to recoup some of the raw material, inflation, and currency inflation that you've seen over the last couple of years. For most companies, you are seeing volume degrade as a result of that.That's the elasticity that you see when prices go up. People try to be a little bit more mindful with respect to their purchasing. But they're all seeing some negative from volume and price accelerate. I think you'll still see this in the case for the next couple-- probably at least another quarter, possibly two. And then hopefully, as price starts to anniversary, those price increases that they already took, volume starts to pick up a bit. I mean, these are staples categories where you do have to eventually go out and start to consume again.- Um, Olivia, I notice as I look across your picks here, you have three strong buys in companies that are makeup or sort of personal care companies-- Bath &amp; Body Works, Estee Lauder, Ulta. But then, you also have them scattered across your other recommendations. In other words, I'm curious what differentiates within personal account and makeup those three names-- what are they doing that maybe some of the others aren't?OLIVIA TONG: Sure-- sure, maybe-- starting with Estee, I think the main focus this week for earnings is the pace of reopening in China and the consumers return to travel, but whether it's domestically within China to Hainan and other travel destinations, and then, also abroad eventually. We think this will be the top focus. Other things that are really interesting with respect to Estee is they acquired Tom Ford a couple of months ago so learning more about the plans there.That was announced in mid-November and obviously, a very high end brand. So how that anchors the ultra luxe portion of Estee's brand portfolio will be an important place to be paying attention to. E.L.F is another company that we think positively on. It did very well last year, but we think that they have continued momentum. So we think they're one of the best positioned in beauty because they have relatively manageable price points and still a lot of market share opportunity to gain. So quite a bit there. So we do have a bit of an eclectic group and there are pockets everywhere.- Within that eclectic group, where is the deepest value?OLIVIA TONG: I think the deepest value in a couple of names. Newell, Newell Brands is one of them. Now that is a challenge-- is a challenge right now because of all the inventory destocking that you've heard at retail. But I think as you get into the back half of the year, this is an inexpensive stock that historically has traded in the 15 to 19 times range pre-acquisition and is now closer to 11 times. So a lot is already embedded into the stock in terms of negativity so we think that as time progresses, that will get more interesting.- Raymond James managing director Olivier Tong, good to see you. Get some-- have a fun week. I know it's been busy for you and the team, appreciate it.]"

Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I ask that those of you participating in the Q&amp;A portion of the call to please limit your questions to 2 per person.Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.Story continuesMarc Holliday: Okay. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Normally, our January earnings calls are brief, coming only 7 weeks after our annual investor conference, which we held back on December 5. We had a great conference on that day with attendance at capacity at One Vanderbilt, and we received a lot of positive feedback after the presentation. Not surprisingly during the conference, we set out for ourselves a characteristically robust best agenda for 2023, which included business plan, aspirational goals, I think there were 18 or 20, some of which included 1.7 million square feet of leasing, over $2 billion of asset sales and joint ventures, significant debt reduction and completion of several important development projects that we expect to deliver timely and on or under budget this year.Notable among them is One Madison Avenue, which we actually topped out ahead of schedule in just 1 week after our investor conference. So it was a pretty amazing day. There were over 700 people gathered to witness the event of the laying of the last piece of steel on this truly great project in the Midtown South submarket, marking a turning point for the project where we now see completion in sight. And the timing of that topping out was truly perfect as it gave us the ability to stand on that 18,000 square foot penthouse floor with 18-foot lab sites and unobstructed views of Midtown and Downtown and standing there, you can truly understand why our new tenant that has just joined the roster of Tennis to the One Madison Avenue. Rent roll is 777 partners.They were attracted to the opportunity and we were able to lease it up over 1 year ahead of our underwriting, just stressing the importance of not only hitting underwritten economics but also exceeding the timing has big positive effect on the project, and we hope there's more to come. This lease, along with the others, we announced last night, underscores the early leasing achievements we had in January, which is typically a slow month but for us, turned out to be a pretty good month and a good start to the year. Hopefully, it pretends of increased activity to come in 2023 though a long holiday break followed by the MLK holiday weekend. We've seen a noticeable pickup in tour activity over the last 10 days, and we received around a fresh new proposal.Shopping Center, BuildingPhoto by Heidi Fin on UnsplashSo we're optimistic. We're getting stuff done, and we're on plan most importantly. So on the heels of signing over 370,000 square feet of office leases since our investor conference at the beginning of December, we managed to assemble a pipeline of leases totaling 700,000 square feet, where it stands today, 100,000 square feet of which we hope to sign over the next 60 days. We'll be moving and hustling to try and get back up. We're currently negotiating leases at 450 Park Avenue, 919 Third, 45 Lex, 1350 Avenue of the Americas and another lease at One Madison. In addition, we are just beginning to market our redevelopment project for 245 Park Avenue. We spent quite a bit of time showing off that amazing redevelopment plan that we have for 245 Park, and we are beginning to execute this year.And the early read from the tenant broker community is that this exciting and, I think, a very elegant plan that we have for the asset is going to be very well received by the tenant market, and there seems to be much interest already that we're generating as we're beginning to take these meetings, and we're also generating interest among foreign investors for JV investment. Recall that identifying one or more JV partners for 245 Park is one of the several capital markets goals we have for the year and for a little bit more color on that. I'm going to turn it over to Andrew Mathias.Andrew Mathias: Thanks, Mark. There's still a standoff between buyers and sellers in the market, but we definitely see as financing, hopefully returns and a 5- and 10-year fixed rate financing the CMBS market reopens, which we and all the rest of our market participants here are anxiously awaiting, we think we'll see that standoff thaw a bit. We've been actively in discussions with investors from around the world. We were in the Middle East several months ago. We have a trip plan to Asia in March. The team was present at the Crafts conference in Miami earlier this month talking about the financing trends. And we think there's still a lot of interest in prime New York City assets particularly Park Avenue, which is no secret that it's the best submarket in New York City.And we think we'll have a lot of willing conversations this year from all different types of investors from around the world, talking about 245 and the other aggressive capital goals that we set out for us at the investor conference.Marc Holliday: Great. So more to come on that throughout the first half of the year, we'll keep you guys updated as we pursue our various goals for recapitalizations, refinancings, joint venture sales. We are full guns blazing right now here at Green and working very hard and diligently to set the seeds so that by the middle of the year. We can hopefully start to achieve and knock off some of these goals and continue on a path to what we think will be a pivot year for us in 2023, coming out of the markets we've experienced over the past couple of years and hope to see some more positive news seeping into the market throughout the year. I did want to leave, I'd say, the best for the end before opening up the call to questions.Yesterday, as I trust you may have heard or read, it marks an incredible milestone moment for East Midtown, New York City and Long Island with the official opening of the long-awaited Grand Central Madison Station, right underneath Grand Central Terminal and One Vanderbilt, representing the culmination of the $11 billion Eastside access project. It is a watershed moment. I think it's probably the most important and largest project the MT has completed in many, many decades. And with its grand opening, you now have direct service from Long Island to Grand Central. It's finally become a reality after being, I think, in conception for 60 years in development for 20 and it opens up a direct seamless trip from Long Island, which has a 1.4 million person workforce that now can look to either of Grand Central or Pennsation as its primary destination and it choose its most efficient destination.The MTA is estimating that 45% of nearly half of all Long Island Railroad commuters will -- are expected and will eventually commute direct to Grand Central once full service is up and running this year instead of what is currently altePenn Station, and that translates into 160,000 people a day, and these commuters are essentially arriving literally right at our front door where the majority of our portfolio is located. I can't stress enough the importance of the projected 40 minutes per day or nearly 3.5 hours per week of saved commutation time that the business community puts a short, easy, safe and pleasant commute as its top requirement now coming out of post-pandemic world and as a tool for encouraging employees to work from office. So yesterday, we celebrated with the Governor and the MTA Chair, Jane lever, the opening of this incredible terminal that spans over 700,000 square feet from, I'd say, approximately 42nd Street to 48th Street on what must be 1 to 3 different levels dedicated waiting areas, beautiful new retail stores that will be opening and restaurants and a host of other amenities and it's all well done, well executed, well designed, well conceived, and I would urge anybody that hasn't yet taken the time to swing by and check it out that they do so because it's pretty inspiring to see what can be done after all the time and after all the money is spent, you look at the permanent goods that will come of it for the decades and perhaps centuries to come.The terminal contains 8 tracks and 4 platforms, which will be in service and enable Long Island Railroad to increase its service from Long Island to Manhattan by nearly 50% of capacity. And One Vanderbilt and East Midtown rezoning was really a first step towards unlocking the pent-up demand for new and redeveloped office space in and around Grand Central. And now Grand Central Madison will further transform and revitalize what is undisputably New York City's #1 business district. And we're excited by it as shareholders or stakeholders or followers of the company. You should be excited by it, too, in my opinion. And it's a great way to start the year. So with that, we'll open it up for questions.See also 12 Most Undervalued Pharma Stocks To Buy and 25 Largest Privately Held Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, many analysts believe this market crash has created attractive entry points for beginner investors. Low valuations should be seen as an investment opportunity. A report by Conversant Capital believes the US economy is expected to face a recession in 2023 through the summer, after which a recovery is expected to begin. The report also said that inflation in the US is expected to come down significantly in 2023, providing a strong catalyst to the stock market. Conversant Capital’s report also mentioned some sectors which the firm believes need more attention in 2023. The report said that IT, Health Care, and Energy are its favorite sectors heading into 2023. It plans to steer clear of cyclical industries like Consumer Discretionary and interest-rate sensitive sectors like Real Estate sector.A report by Fidelity said the Federal Reserve is expected to slow its rate hikes in 2023 and would eventually stop them during this year. However, the firm said the Fed’s policy rate will remain higher for longer than the market expects.Over the long term, the stock market is expected to move forward and come out of recession. When it does,  US equities’ valuations will soar, rewarding investors who piled into undervalued stocks with solid fundamentals.

Why American Airlines (AAL) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005222.html,1675098005,STORY,['AAL'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at American Airlines (AAL), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. American Airlines currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if AAL is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this world's largest airline holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor AAL, shares are up 0.55% over the past week while the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry is up 0.67% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 29.17% compares favorably with the industry's 17.84% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of American Airlines have increased 16.44% over the past quarter, and have gained 5.05% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.28% and -4.41%, respectively.Investors should also take note of AAL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AAL is averaging 31,748,138 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with AAL.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AAL's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.54 to $1.93 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that AAL is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep American Airlines on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Principal Financial: mixed.

They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.Earnings conference callOn Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. (ET), Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Houston and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Deanna Strable will lead a discussion of results and the impacts on future prospects, asset quality and capital adequacy during a live conference call, which can be accessed as follows:Via live Internet webcast.

Non-GAAP operating earnings for total company is after tax.2 Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through expenses = pre-tax operating earnings, adjusted for noncontrolling interest divided by operating revenues less pass-through expenses.3 Combined net revenue (a non-GAAP financial measure): net revenue for all PI companies at 100% less pass-through commissions. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for PI as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.4 Includes only funds with ratings assigned by Morningstar; non-rated funds excluded (89 total, 82 are ranked).5 Premiums and fees = premiums and other considerations plus fees and other revenues.6 Pre-tax operating earnings = operating earnings before income taxes and after noncontrolling interest.7 Net revenue = operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders.8 Pre-tax return on net revenue = pre-tax operating earnings divided by net revenue.9 The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of the release. The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions and other expenses that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.10 Pre-tax return on premium and fees = pre-tax operating earnings divided by premium and fees.11 Principal, Principal and symbol design and Principal Financial Group are trademarks and service marks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., a member of the Principal Financial Group.12 As of December 31, 202213 Barron’s, 202214 Pensions &amp; Investments, 2022View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230130005622/en/ContactsMedia Contact: Jane Slusark, 515-362-0482, slusark.jane@principal.com Investor Contact: Humphrey Lee, 515-235-9500, lee.humphrey@principal.com]"

Additionally, Brian Brickhouse, president, Americas Region, Electrical Sector, has joined Rewiring America's CEOs for Electrification, a national coalition of business leaders committed to furthering sustainability through electrification, beginning with the American household. Brickhouse joins the coalition as part of Eaton's continuing efforts to lead the energy transition through key sustainability initiatives including its Home as a Grid approach, which envisions a future in which homes become both producers and users of energy.""Electrification is a core tenet in the ongoing drive to reduce dependence on carbon-based energy sources and deliver on the promise of a sustainable future,"" said Brickhouse. ""From enabling the electrification of homes to helping states and municipalities understand how to leverage federal funding for EV charging infrastructure, Eaton is at the forefront of this movement. I look forward to working with the CEOs for Electrification coalition as we advance this essential element in the energy transition.""According to the United States Energy Information Administration, home energy use accounted for approximately one-sixth of total U.S. energy consumption as of 2020, unlocking a significant opportunity to reduce overall greenhouse gas emission by converting homes to electric power. The CEOs for Electrification coalition drives action by bringing together CEOs across industries to champion electrification, electrify their operations and accelerate market transformation required to electrify everything. Working together, the coalition aims to create millions of new jobs, improve health outcomes and reduce emissions.Story continues""We're thrilled to partner with Eaton and have Brian Brickhouse join the CEOs for Electrification coalition,"" said Rewiring America Head of Partnerships and Engagement Keishaa Austin.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Kings and Aristocrats List: 10 Biggest Stocks. Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings are the companies that have raised their dividend payouts for over 25 years and 50 years in a row, respectively. These companies have healthy balance sheets and have shown compelling performance over the years. Amid the current inflationary pressures, investors are considering dividend growers as these companies have significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns.According to a report by Nuveen, an American asset management company, dividends have been a significant component of total returns of the stock market over the past few decades. During the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 43%, and 72% of the market’s overall return, respectively. The report also mentioned that dividend growth stocks outperformed the market with less risk from 1973 to 2021. Various other studies also revealed that dividend growers have been a reliable source of regular income for shareholders in the past. From December 1999 to June 2019, the S&amp;P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats generated a total return of 590.3%, with dividends accounting for 57% of the total returns, according to a report by S&amp;P Global.Lord Abbett also highlighted the importance of dividend growers in one of its reports. The stocks that have raised their payouts regularly have provided significant downside protection, according to the report.Dividend stocks like Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) are popular dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades. We will further discuss other dividend kings and aristocrats in this article.Photo by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:Story continuesFor this list, we scanned elite groups of Dividend Kings and Dividend Aristocrats and selected top companies based on their market capitalizations.

While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”25.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

These included cost savings, broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base, as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale. In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution. As such, we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in Blackstone.”17.

We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

Controlled directly from the patient's in-room tablet, the robot will allow the patient to create their own path through the exhibits and enjoy an immersive experience from afar.This program, piloted at MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital, is expanding to work with Prisma Health Children's Hospital in the Midlands and Upstate. Educators at the Aquarium are working with hospital staff to arrange these robot tours during patients' free time, long stays or even during their treatments.""It has been truly amazing to facilitate this experience. The kids are able to take control and drive through the Aquarium on their own exploration, when in many other aspects of their lives, they may lack that sense of being the one ‘at the wheel,"" said virtual programs coordinator, Alayna Robertson.Nature has an enormous impact on well-being, and the telepresence robot offers a bridge to connect patients with water and wildlife. Patients have full control of the robot, letting curiosity guide them as they move forward to visit a sea turtle at its tank window, look up to see a shark swim by or zoom in to get a closer look at the iridescent scales on a fish. They are able to speak and engage with the Aquarium educator teaching them along their adventure. They can even talk to Aquarium guests or wave to fellow kids on a field trip.Betsy McMillan, child life manager at MUSC Children's Health shared, ""We were thrilled when the Aquarium team approached us about this program. The Lowcountry views from our hospital rooms offer the perfect background to this unique and educational escape for our inpatients. We are grateful for this amazing opportunity.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Aflac (AFL) earns a Zacks Rank #2 two days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.21 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Aflac has an Earnings ESP of 1.29%.AFL is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Capital One (COF) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Capital One is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 25, 2023.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)24.

In addition, Chubb successfully grew its profitable high-net-worth personal lines. While we still consider Chubb to be a high-quality business, few catalysts remain after what was, in our opinion, a remarkable run of successful business execution.

We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.77%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.51%.Heading into today, shares of the biopharmaceutical company had gained 2.96% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 0.54% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.41% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Regeneron as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 3, 2023. On that day, Regeneron is projected to report earnings of $9.69 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 59.15%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.17 billion, down 36.06% from the year-ago period.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Regeneron should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.83, which means Regeneron is trading at a discount to the group.Story continuesMeanwhile, REGN's PEG ratio is currently 2.02.

In the last reported quarter, it beat earnings expectations by 14.85%. It surpassed earnings estimates by 20.08%, on average, in the last four quarters.What Our Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Regeneron this time around.

Price and Consensus  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and ConsensusRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayA major chunk of Regeneron’s revenues comes from the sales of its lead drug, Eylea, which is approved for various ophthalmology indications (neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema, among others). Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer AG.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, while Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the country. Regeneron also records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Eylea sales in the United States in the previous quarter increased 11%. Sales in the fourth quarter are likely to have witnessed a sequential increase with growth in demand for label expansions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eylea sales in the United States is pegged at $1.69 billion.Apart from Eylea, investors will focus on the asthma drug Dupixent’s performance, sales of which are recorded by Sanofi SNY. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for drugs like Dupixent and Kevzara. While Sanofi records sales, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara.  Profits from Dupixent sales have been REGN’s primary growth driver in the last few quarters.Story continuesDupixent has maintained its stellar performance on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Sales of the drug were up 40% in the previous quarter.  The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Label expansion of the drug in the past few months is likely to have boosted sales further and resulted in incremental revenues for Regeneron in the fourth quarter.Investors will focus on the performance of Libtayo and PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo and will pay Sanofi a royalty on such sales. Sales of Libtayo were up 20% in the previous quarter. Sales are likely to have recorded sequential growth in the to-be-reported quarter on label expansions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Libtayo’s sales is pegged at $151 million.Regeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States. Sanofi records net product sales of the drug outside the United States and pays Regeneron a royalty on such sales. Total sales in the previous quarter were down 1% and the fourth quarter has likely experienced the same.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively). Therefore, REGEN-COV is not currently authorized for use in any U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions. Hence, this revision dented sales in the first nine months of 2022 from this stream and sales are likely to have been negligible in the fourth quarter.RECENT UPDATESIn December, the European Commission (EC) expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent (dupilumab) in the European Union to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.In November, Libtayo also won EC approval as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.Share Price PerformanceRegeneron’s shares have gained 22% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some more drug/biotech stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season.Novo Nordisk NVO has an Earnings ESP of +12.81% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio based on the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Ameriprise Financial, W.W. Grainger, FMC Corp and Allegion are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 5% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsStory continuesGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.

QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe strong U.S. dollar against major currencies and the concluded divestments of certain business units in the past 12 months are also anticipated to have negatively impacted the fiscal third-quarter top line. The company projected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates to reduce fiscal 2023 sales by $1.2 billion, adjusted EBIT by $130 million and adjusted EBIT margin by 25 basis points.DXC’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by the business operation closure in Russia following the Kremlin force’s invasion of Ukraine.

However, sequential revenue stabilization is expected to have continued.The negative impacts of the aforementioned factors are likely to have been partially offset by DXC’s strength in the digital business and partnerships, which have been helping it expand in the cloud computing space.
