So far this year, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 53.8%, outpacing the industry’s 36.4% growth.What’s Favoring the Stock?The price of natural gas has improved drastically in the past year. Being a leading producer of natural gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) in the United States, the massive improvement in the commodity price is a boon for Range Resources’ upstream operations.In Appalachia, RRC has decades of low-risk drilling inventory, brightening its production outlook. The company has lower well costs per lateral foot than many other upstream players.Range Resources has a strong focus on strengthening its balance sheet.

In the prolific gas-rich Marcellus shale play, CHK’s operation spreads across roughly 650,000 net acres, where an average of four to five rigs will be operating this year. Chesapeake Energy also has a strong presence in Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale play, making the production outlook bright. Overall, being a leading upstream energy player, CHK has more than 15 years of inventory, signifying more than 2,200 gas locations.Story continuesEnterprise Products generates stable fee-based revenues from its extensive pipeline network across more than 50,000 miles, transporting natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil petrochemicals and refined products.The midstream infrastructure provider also has storage assets that can hold more than 260 million barrels of NGL, petrochemical, refined products and crude oil. These assets can also store 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Moreover, Enterprise Products has $5.5 billion of major capital projects under construction that are likely to provide incremental fee-based revenues.The positive trajectory in oil price is a boon for ExxonMobil’s upstream operations.

5,cfcf9341-0774-328e-85cc-28609538eba8,UNM,2022-09-24,4 Stocks With Relative Price Strength for Volatile Times,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-relative-price-strength-120212989.html,1663934532,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'DINO', 'MPC', 'MUSA', 'UNM']","[The Fed’s latest move to raise its core interest rate by another 0.75% has cast a pall over the stock market. It led to a precipitous drop in the equity indices on Thursday — marking the third consecutive day of declines and falling to lows not seen since July. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.As such, trading is expected to be choppy for the U.S. stock markets going ahead, even as investors have been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. Risks stemming from recession fears, geopolitical tensions and dwindling liquidity may also lead to a rough road for equities.In the current jittery market environment, for investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup, it is time to focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Here are the four stocks that made it through the screen:HF Sinclair DINO: HF Sinclair is a producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Dallas, TX-based firm indicates 817.1% year-over-year earnings per share growth.

(NYSE:TMO) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-520-thermo-fisher-scientific-130038004.html,1663938038,STORY,['TMO'],"[Let's talk about the popular Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$604 and falling to the lows of US$501. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Thermo Fisher Scientific's current trading price of US$520 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 27.4x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 25.79x, which means if you buy Thermo Fisher Scientific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Thermo Fisher Scientific should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Furthermore, it seems like Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price is quite stable, which means there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s priced similarly to industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Thermo Fisher Scientific generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Thermo Fisher Scientific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TMO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TMO? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TMO, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Thermo Fisher Scientific as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

13,bcbd5f16-9eda-3e66-92a4-9c58dcd21389,EQR,2022-09-24,3 Top Stocks From a Prosperous Residential REIT Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stocks-prosperous-residential-121712512.html,1663935432,STORY,"['EQR', '^GSPC', 'IRT', 'BRT']","[The REIT And Equity Trust - Residential constituents are expected to benefit from the healthy fundamentals of this industry. Rental housing demand remains robust, with young adults forming new households and the job market showing improvement. De-densification and the desire for more space is leading to fewer adults per apartment, thereby creating incremental demand for renting units. Moreover, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option.While product absorption continues in the Sun Belt and other non-gateway metros, the gateway metros are also showcasing a strong rebound. Therefore, residential REITs like Equity Residential EQR, Independence Realty Trust, Inc. IRT and BRT Apartments Corp. BRT are expected to ride the growth curve, despite interest rate hike, elevated deliveries and regulation woes.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs also focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region. Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, enrolment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.What's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Healthy Rental Demand, Rent and Occupancy Growth: The urban and job-centered suburban markets have been experiencing a continued flow of residents with the reopening of offices and returning of lifestyle amenities to the established markets. Moreover, de-densification and the desire for more space are resulting in fewer adults per apartment, thereby creating incremental demand for renting units. Also, higher household income is supporting rent growth. There is strong demand from young adults who are gaining from tight labor market conditions and record wage growth. Also, since high mortgage rate has increased the cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is becoming difficult, making renting of apartment units a viable option. These positives are supporting high occupancy and rent growth for properties of residential REITs. While in most parts of the United States, apartment rents are climbing, growth is taking place at a moderate rate reflecting a more seasonal trend. This indicates that the fundamentals are still healthy but trending toward a sustainable level. In terms of markets, while there is a rebound in demand for the coastal markets, the Sun Belt markets too, continued to experience high demand compared to supply. There has also been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. In fact, the fall 2022 pre-lease season closed with record occupancy and growth in rents.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend, and now the residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, as well as enhancing customer experience. The REITs are now focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in process and process enhancements. Improvement in search and tour booking as well as smart home access has gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on these. Such efforts are aimed at generating incremental net operating income in the years ahead.Rent Control and Higher Interest Rates: The rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In fact, in recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs’ power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees. Moreover, the hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #87, which places it at the top 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the positive funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Over the past year, the industry’s FFO per share estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved 4.2% and 0.6% north, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 20.7% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 16.2% and the broader Finance sector’s decline of 14.7%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.76X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 16.30X.

It is well-positioned to benefit from the improving demand for apartment living, its portfolio rebalancing efforts in the urban and suburban markets, and a strong balance sheet.It concluded a strong leasing season, driven by healthy demand and pricing for its apartment units. As a result, same-store revenue growth is on track to either match or surpass the projections mentioned in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Also, occupancy levels remained high.Equity Residential’s efforts to diversify its portfolio in the urban and suburban markets, with an affluent tenant base, bode well. Its strategic buyouts and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform act as tailwinds.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 FFO per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates revised marginally upward over the past month to $3.51.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Xylem's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Xylem How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xylem is:13% = US$421m ÷ US$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Xylem's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Xylem's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Xylem saw little to no growth in the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesWe then compared Xylem's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 8.4% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is XYL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Xylem Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 49% (meaning the company retains51% of profits) in the last three-year period, Xylem's earnings growth was more or les flat. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Xylem has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 35% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Xylem's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 20%, over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Xylem has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

However, the stock has displayed some resilience, increasing 1.2% in the past three months. Let’s delve deeper and find out why investors should hold on to the stock.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthMGM Resorts, one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry, is well poised to grow on high brand awareness. The company’s superior business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations are the primary growth drivers. In the past few years, the company has taken various initiatives to align every recognized brand into one global entertainment brand.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also benefiting from strong leisure demand. During the second quarter of 2022, the company benefited from strong leisure demand and better convention business in the Las Vegas market. During the quarter, net revenues from Las Vegas Strip Resorts were $2,137.2 million, up 112.7% year over year. Increased business volume and travel activity (on a year-over-year basis), coupled with the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan and Aria, added to the upside.The company continues to focus on sports betting and iGaming to drive growth. BetMGM has a long-term growth target of 20-25% in U.S. sports betting and iGaming. Currently, the company is on track to achieve its target. Given the positive momentum in markets coupled with its unique and unparalleled online and offline offerings, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth with revenue expectations of more than $1.3 billion in 2022. The company expects to achieve a positive EBITDA in 2023. To drive growth, the company continues to invest in additional markets.On the other hand, the company rebranded its customer loyalty program from M life to MGM Rewards. The updated program emphasizes key opportunities like targeting high-value non-gaming customers in addition to high-volume gaming customers as well as incentivizing cross-property patronage and tier progression with more benefits. The launch of MGM Rewards also comes with a new streamlined app that makes it simple for members to review their tier status and benefits.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Hyatt Hotels Corporation H, Playa Hotels &amp; Resorts N.V.

The projections of future earnings are based on data from Morningstar analysts.Norwegian Cruise LineThe first stock to make the cut is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH), a Miami, Florida-based cruise operator with a fleet of 28 ships for a total of 59,150 berths that sail to various destinations around the world.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. List of 52-Week LowsList of 3-Year LowsList of 5-Year LowsNorwegian Cruise Line has a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.14, which results from Thursdays closing price of $14.39 per share and analyst expectations for net earnings per share of approximately $1.42 for the next full fiscal year.The stock has dropped 48.79% over the past year for a market capitalization of $6.06 billion and a 52-week range of $10.31 to $29.45.2 Stocks With Low Forward Price-Earnings RatiosFrom a profitability perspective, the company has a negative operating margin as it continues to factor in the impact of travel restrictions and other measures to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus during the pandemic. In addition to the pandemic issue, the war in Ukraine and unfavorable economic conditions weighed on the company's business.Total revenue for the trailing 12 months through the second quarter increased to $2.35 billion from $23.6 million in 2021. Despite this, operating income continued to deteriorate from a loss of $2.24 billion for the trailing 12 months that ended June 30, 2021 to a loss of $2.46 billion this year.Despite the anticipated improvement in occupancy rates (the company expects a 1.34 times sequential increase to about 80% for the third quarter of 2022), the result would not yet be enough to avert another loss for the current quarter.While the fallout from the pandemic and headwinds from global geopolitical tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict may continue to weigh on business results, analysts remain optimistic that the company will return to positive net income in the near future.Story continuesAnalysts project Norwegian Cruise Line will report positive net income from continuing operations of $1.40 per share in 2023, but are forecasting another loss of $3.76 per share in 2022. The reversal in net income could potentially lead to a strong recovery in the share price.On its balance sheet as of June 30, the company had $1.9 billion in cash, but was encumbered with approximately $12.2 billion in total debt, up from $11.6 billion in 2021.Wall Street sell-side analysts issued a median recommendation rating of overweight for the stock with an average price target of $17.23 per share.Kinross GoldThe second stock that qualifies is Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC), a Toronto, Canada-based explorer, developer and miner of gold properties in the U.S., Brazil, Chile, Russia, Mauritania and Ghana.Kinross Gold has a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.73, which derives from Thursdays closing price of $3.55 per share and analyst expectations for earnings of approximately 41 cents per share for the next full fiscal year.The stock has fallen 32.77% over the past year for a market capitalization of $4.61 billion and a 52-week range of $3 to $7.13.2 Stocks With Low Forward Price-Earnings RatiosThe profitability of the business depends on the price of the precious metals and production volumes. The company reported an increase in gold equivalent production to nearly 454,000 ounces in the second quarter of 2022, representing 19% year-over-year growth, driven by higher metal concentration in the mineral and higher throughput at its deposits in Mauritania.Despite higher production of saleable metal, total all-in sustaining costs per gold equivalent ounce increased 16.6% year over year to $1,341 in the second quarter, reflecting inflationary pressures on energy and inputs combined with an increase in waste materials being removed during mining.The company realized revenue of $1,872 per ounce of GEO from sales of the precious metal in the second quarter, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter. However, higher production costs due to inflationary pressures weighed heavily on margins as a higher price for the precious metal showed it was unable to avoid a 12.3% year-over-year margin decline to $845 per GEO for the quarter.As such, pro forma net income from ongoing mineral activities was 3 cents per share, compared to 5 cents in the prior-year quarter.For the upcoming period, the company calls for production of between 2.04 million and 2.26 million ounces of GEO in 2022 and between 2.19 million and 2.42 million ounces of GEO in 2023.However, the AISC is expected to continue increasing in the near future. In 2022, this should be $1,240 per GEO, up from $1,138 per GEO in 2021. In the absence of a specific company forecast for AISC in 2023, the following gives an idea of how the item could continue to develop: It is possible that despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive stance to slow down the rapid rise in prices of goods and services, some inflationary pressures will persist and the AISC will rise slightly further in 2023. This inflation seems fairly entrenched given the nature of its triggers.Therefore, in addition to higher production, a lot of help will be needed from the gold price, but it currently seems to be suffering from rising interest rates. Gold futures, which expire in December of this year, have fallen steadily since earlier in 2022, roughly when the Fed started raising interest rates. Year-to-date contracts are down 9.5% to a level of $1,653.80 an ounce as of this writing.This gold price is well below (down 11.6%) the average Kinross Gold was able to generate from sales in the second quarter and is expected to continue this trend in lockstep with interest rates tightening. This factor makes it a risky stock to invest in now.But after the interest rate hike, the economy could enter a recession phase as early as this quarter, according to analysts. This, combined with geopolitical tensions centered around the Russia-Ukraine conflict, could trigger a period of heightened market volatility along with increased uncertainty.Assuming investors buy enough safe-haven gold to involuntarily create an imbalance between demand and supply, a higher gold price environment could emerge. In order for the price to recover above its second-quarter level, demand for gold as a hedging instrument must increase sharply in the face of tighter monetary policy. This is quite difficult, but not impossible given the current macroeconomic conditions. Should this happen, Kinross Gold's operations and earnings are sure to benefit, which will be reflected in very strong upside potential for the share price.Wall Street sell-side analysts issued a median recommendation rating of overweight with an average price target of $5.89 per share.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Western nations that once relied on energy supplies from Russia—the world’s second largest natural gas producer and third largest petroleum producer—condemned the invasion by refusing to buy Russian energy, or were cut off by President Vladimir Putin.Nowhere is this crisis more pronounced and more dangerous than in Europe, where a long-standing gambit on cheap Russian gas has backfired. At the onset of the war, the European Union’s 27 member nations relied on Russia for 40% of their natural gas—the second most common energy source in Europe behind petroleum oil.But now, with Russian supplies limited, the benchmark price of natural gas in Europe has more than doubled over the past year, and both consumers and corporations are getting hit hard.Electricity bills have already tripled in many places. Some coffee shops and restaurants have seen monthly bills rise from €2,000 a year ago to €7,000 now, and major industries have started furloughing workers and cutting back on expenses due to high electrical bills. The situation is so dire that governments that previously renounced fossil fuels and nuclear power are desperately reopening shuttered coal plants and nuclear sites, and nationalizing utility companies to save them from going bankrupt.But as bad as it is now, these might still be the good days for Europe. With winter and higher gas demand on the way, experts told Fortune that Europe’s energy market has never been more vulnerable. Even the slightest uptick in energy demand anywhere in the world could push entire sectors of Europe’s manufacturing industry to shut down entirely, devastating European economies with a wave of unemployment, high prices, and in all likelihood public unrest and divisions between European nations.“Prices are at historically record levels. We have never ever seen anything actually like this,” Tatiana Mitrova, a research fellow with Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, told Fortune. “This will become quite painful.”Story continuesTrying to prepare for a crisisAs soon as the war began in Ukraine, European nations scrambled to secure their energy systems against disruptions of natural gas supply from Russia. They had two options: increase supply of gas coming into the continent, or reduce the demand.First, Europe turned to the supply side to resolve the mounting energy crisis by diversifying the countries that supply natural gas to the bloc, and reduce its reliance on Russian flows. EU countries looked to Qatar, the U.S., and central Asian nations to strike trade deals for both natural gas and LNG (liquified natural gas), a more easily transportable form of gas that can be shipped by sea rather than flowed through pipelines.But trying to solve the crisis on the supply side comes with a catch: time. Increasing natural gas flows from countries other than Russia requires building more pipelines, while importing more LNG means constructing dedicated terminals in Europe that can regasify liquid gas, a process which can take anywhere from two to five years.And there is only so much countries can do to shore up supplies in the short term. Expanding natural gas infrastructure is expensive, demands years of investment, and the results likely won’t kick in until the summer of next year, Penny Leake, a research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told Fortune. Four other experts that Fortune spoke with said that until the summer of 2023 at least, suppliers are unlikely to be able to increase flows to Europe by a high enough volume to replace Russian gas.With immediate supplies maxed out, Europe’s energy system is balanced on a ledge. That means that addressing demand is the only realistic measure left at Europe’s disposal. And that could come through painful means like mandated and widespread energy rationioning, according to Mitrova.“I'm afraid that the only solution this winter will be on the demand side,” said Mitrova. “I think it will be quite difficult to avoid some sort of rationing and restrictions in gas demand.”Economic spiralEuropean countries including Germany, France, and Spain approved energy conservation measures this summer in an effort to increase gas reserves as much as possible before the weather turns colder.But the stability of Europe’s gas reserves depend on a relatively mild winter, because if it gets cold enough, it could send demand soaring higher than Europe’s reserves can handle.European governments have already implemented some energy conservation and rationing laws, such as turning off traffic lights at night and dimming lighting on historic buildings. They have stopped short of ordering consumers to lower their energy use, but with energy demand much higher during the winter, they may be forced to make some difficult choices.“We should understand that we are choosing between different bad options, we do not have a good scenario at the moment,” Mitrova said.Reducing gas demand in Europe either through rationing or high prices could have a prolonged and debilitating effect on Europe’s society, and it’s already having destabilizing consequences for some industries and economies.Over 70% of European fertilizer producers—which rely on the ammonia extracted from natural gas production—have already halted operations, according to Mitrova, and soaring energy costs are forcing those European factories and manufacturers to slow down operations.But the worst-case scenario would be a shutdown of European manufacturing industries most reliant on natural gas—including glassmakers and steel companies.“A big thing that we will be seeing in the next few weeks, months, and into 2023, will be how this situation of sustained very high gas and electricity prices could impact industrial activity,” Mauro Chavez, research director of European gas at Wood Mackenzie, told Fortune, adding that many of these “more sensitive” industries may be forced to shut down soon because of energy prices.Chavez added that so far, most European factories have only reduced their capacity, rather than shut down entirely. But industrial plants that rely on natural gas for electricity or are located in countries where gas plays a bigger role in the energy mix, could start shutting down soon because of unbearably high costs.This week, Europe’s largest car company Volkswagen suggested that high electricity bills could lead the company to relocate its production capacity from countries that were highly-dependent on Russian gas—including Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia—to southwestern European nations which have access to more diversified energy streams, including LNG terminals.A new type of energy crisisThe crisis could not have come at a worse time for Europe, as the continent’s energy system is still recovering from a summer of extreme weather and worker strikes slowing operations. Combined with these challenges, this crunch could be one of the worst energy crises on the continent since the 1970s.It already means high prices for average Europeans, companies cutting back on production, and a slowdown in the fertilizer industry. But if it forces all kinds of industries to shut down or relocate, experts say it could lead to a much longer wave of unemployment and economic downturn on the continent.That kind of outcome could persist long after winter is over, experts say. Cutting back on industrial capacity could lead to “lower economic activity, higher levels of unemployment and even greater potential for recession,” Goldman Sachs senior energy strategist Samantha Dart wrote in a recent post, evoking memories of the rationing and unemployment that swept the continent during the 1970s oil crisis.The prices of other energy sources—especially coal—have also risen over the past several months with higher global demand for them. And a summer of extreme weather and drought has crippled Europe’s nuclear and hydropower generation capacity, throwing its ability to compensate for Russian natural gas into doubt.“Europe is now in a very challenging situation. I would say it is probably worse than the 1970s when there was just an oil crisis. Now we are talking about a crisis with oil, nuclear, hydropower, and gas,” Mitrova said.Diversifying away from natural gas immediately after the war broke out was made easier by several other energy sources at Europe’s disposal, Ryhana Rasidi, gas analyst at energy consultancy Kpler, told Fortune. But with winter on the way, these alternative sources are beginning to show issues of their own.In addition to supply shortfalls for natural gas, Europe will soon start feeling the effects of a ban on Russian oil, set to kick in from December onwards. And European countries that may not have been extremely reliant on natural gas are still feeling the sting of an energy crisis. France, long considered one of Europe’s more stable energy suppliers, generates around 70% of its energy from nuclear sources, but efforts to increase power capacity in preparation for the winter have so far been hindered by hot weather and worker strikes.Combined with a renewable energy grid unprepared for the weight of this winter’s demands, Europe’s new energy crisis promises to be unique in all the worst ways, on every front.‘Wild west scenario’The brunt of winter has yet to hit, but tensions are already starting to emerge, leaving politicians with some tough choices.If the situation deteriorates, every European country is in for a “wild west scenario,” Fatih Birol, head of the watchdog International Energy Agency, warned this week in an interview with the FT.Birol said the energy crisis could go one of two ways: “EU and members will work in solidarity, supporting each other…or there is another scenario, if everybody is for himself.”Cracks between traditional EU allies have already begun to show. Last month, Scandinavian neighbors heavily criticized Norway—Europe’s leading domestic natural gas producer—for its decision to curb energy exports in an effort to protect Norwegian consumers.And if rising electrical bills combine with a wave of unemployment and economic downturn, the crisis could spill out onto the streets.In Germany, the U.K., the Czech Republic and elsewhere, citizens have already protested rising electricity bills. Last month, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that high energy bills were a “powder keg for society.”“We can expect some protests,” Mitrova said, adding that Europe should anticipate movements similar to the Yellow Jacket protesters who emerged in France in 2018 protesting higher costs of living and electricity bills.“European politicians have to prepare for a very difficult season,” she said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Both digital assets continue to trade sideways, as they lack a substantive catalyst to push prices higher.Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell 4% on moderate volume on Friday, following a 5% increase on Thursday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now trading below $19,000 and is down 5% week over week. So far this year, bitcoin prices are down 61%.Ether (ETH) fell 3%, also on moderate volume compared to its 20-day moving average. Ether prices are down 12% week over week, and 65% year to date. Since the widely anticipated and successful Ethereum Merge, ETH prices are down approximately 20%. Ether supply has increased by 5,400 post-Merge, though supply would have likely increased by more than 105,000 ETH had it not occurred. So while the Merge has not been deflationary by textbook definition, it has slowed ETH’s inflation rate considerably.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell 2.79% on the day.Economic Calendar: The economic calendar was light today, but there were a couple of items worth considering.The private sector business activity continues to contract, but not at the rate that was expected. The S&amp;P Global U.S. Composite PMI, which tracks data from manufacturing and service companies, was 49.3 in September. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion of business, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction.September’s reading was higher than August’s reading of 44, and above expectations for 48. Ironically, business expansion is not ideal for risk assets at the moment, as it will likely prolong the Federal Reserve’s current fight against inflation.U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 480 points, a 1.6% drop that sent the index to its lowest point of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 both slipped about 2%.Story continuesCommodities: Energy sold off as well, with WTI crude oil falling 5.4%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Technical TakeThe USD Continues to Offer the Clearest Signal on BTC PricesThe macroeconomic narrative saturating every pore of crypto-asset markets is difficult to ignore.With the Federal Reserve trying to stave off inflation by raising interest rates and reducing the size of its $8 trillion balance sheet, risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, will continue to come under pressure.As interest rates increase, holding the U.S. dollar becomes more attractive because of rising yields. Speaking on Friday’s First Mover program, Coindesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn likened the current bid behind the dollar to investors who purchased UST in search of higher yield.The correlative or causative relationship between the two assets remains unclear, but also cannot be easily ignored.For starters, bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) have an almost completely inverse relationship currently. As recently as November 2021, the opposite could be said as BTC and DXY prices moved relatively in tandem.Ultimately, the relationship appears to be between BTC and an increase in a risk-on appetite, with the impact occurring via the relationship between BTC and the U.S. dollar. Given the on again/off again relationship between the two assets, traders will likely be watching for correlations to shift again.On a technical basis, BTC appears to be trading near fair value as mentioned in Wednesday’s Market Wrap. Bitcoin’s weekly chart going back to July of 2021 shows an asset trading near an area of significant price agreement.BTC options open interest by strike price. (Glassnode)Absent a new bullish catalyst, there doesn’t appear to be much incentive for investors to push prices higher at the moment.Derivatives markets show some appetite for risk, but little that counters a “neutral for now” narrative. Looking at Glassnode’s BTC open interest by strike price chart, there appears to be elevated put buying at the $18,000 strike price.A put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specific price. Were bitcoin prices to fall below $18,000, those put options would likely be exercised, putting additional downside pressure on the markets.Call option purchases (i.e. the right but not the obligation to buy) begin to increase at the $19,500 strike price, a 4% premium to current prices.Altcoin RoundupEthereum Merge Vastly Increased Stakefish’s Profile, but 25% of Its Employees Are Gone Anyway: Layoffs at stakefish took effect on the same day as the Ethereum Merge – just as they were set to play a key role in securing the revamped blockchain.

You can see the Dow now below 30,000, looking at a five-day chart. Clearly, it has been a brutal week for the markets. Over the past five days, Dow now off just around 5%. On an intraday basis, the NASDAQ falling below 11,000, as we've seen a lot of these larger cap tech giants here getting hit, as we've seen rising rates.Obviously, the strong dollar here weighing on the broader markets. S&amp;P falling well below 3,700, now on track for 3,600. We had Goldman coming out today, lowering their year end target on the S&amp;P. So certainly some fear in the market action today. And really, we can say that about the market action for the week.Over the past five days, you can see the S&amp;P off just over 5 and 1/2%. I want to pull up the VIX. The fear gauge index certainly very important here to keep an eye on. Spiking above 30 here, really shows some of the fear out there in the market right now. Also the 10-year yield pulling back just a bit, now off just around 2 basis points at 3.69. It did top 3.8 earlier in the session today.Let's take a look at some of the sector action here because, again, we are seeing red across the board. Now, on an intraday basis, you're looking at energy off just over 7%, the XLE off 7%. Weakness in energy is a big story here in today's market. Consumer discretionary materials among the worst performers for the day.And then taking a look at the past five days, a very similar picture here. All 11 of the S&amp;P sectors in the red. Energy by far the laggard, off nearly 11%. Consumer discretionary, real estate here among the biggest laggards. Consumer staples, I guess you can say, it's the best performer of the bunch. It's still off, though, just around 3 and 1/2%.Story continuesAll right, let's get you up to speed on the currency action here, driving a lot of the losses that we're seeing play out in the equities markets. You have the strong dollar clearly a headwind here for the market. The dollar index once again moving higher today. Jared Blikre has a closer look at that for us. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey there. Well, let's take a look at our heat map, which has to do with the currencies. And all this green and dark green is the US dollar strengthening. This is a five-day price action. I'm just going to show you what happened today only. The British pound up 3.7%. This is an astounding move by cable here. By the way, this is inverted. Usually, we look at the currency cross upside down. But 25% over the last year means a lot of consternation.And I'm going to show you the max chart. Now we go back to the early 2000, but you can go all the way back to about the 1980s. We haven't seen a price here since the 1980s. We're talking about Margaret Thatcher. And what that means for all these currencies is more pain. And when we have these highly leveraged currencies, guess what? Institutions are forced to deleverage and sometimes sell their good holdings for bad holdings in order to raise cash for potential margin calls.So let's take a look. I just want to show you. I'm writing this up for the weekend. And I have a graphic here prepared here. We have the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira tied basically for the top spot, weakening against the dollar by about 40%. Then we have the krona over in Sweden and the yen. Now, these are two developed market currencies.And when you have this kind of action in foreign exchange in these markets, as I said, forced deleveraging could cause more pain. And we're seeing that play out this week, with the NASDAQ heading to the lowest price-- the Dow heading to the lowest price since November of 2020. All in all, not the best week for currencies, and much less, equities, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, thank you, Jared. Let's get over to Ines Ferre, who has a check on oil energy just absolutely crashing today. Hi there, Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, Dave, and crude closing out its fourth consecutive week of losses. Let's take a look at our YFi Interactive board. We're watching WTI, which closed below $80 a barrel at 78.74, its lowest close since early January. On a technical level, it could be heading towards $75. Then you're looking at brent crude, down more than 4 and 1/2%, closing just above $86 per barrel.Why the declines? Well, the strong US dollar that Jared was just talking about, worries of a recession as central banks raise interest rates, and China still has that zero COVID policy, a big concern for demand going forward.

The chip sector outpaced market declines yesterday and are still mostly lower this morning. A new note coming from Morgan Stanley makes the case that greater headwinds are still ahead for semiconductors due to a slowdown in macroeconomic conditions expected to leave a big impact throughout the next year.Morgan Stanley also lowered its price target on AMD to $95 from $102. For more on this, let's bring in ""Yahoo Finance's"" own Dan Howley. Dan, when we think about some of the issues that are really getting weaved into the warnings now coming from banks in the broader semiconductor space, you know what really sticks out to you as of right now?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think from this note at least the big thing that stuck out to me was the Industrial scale parts of the chip industry. So think the bigger companies that are going to be purchasing, or normally would be purchasing chips to fill out servers and things along those lines, that's something that they said would eventually be impacted.Now they said that the fact that we're seeing the economy kind of go south is slightly hurting these stocks. Let me just throw this out there. I'd say it's a lot more than that, because if you look at prices year-to-date, we're looking at the likes of Intel down nearly 50%, AMD down nearly more than 50%, Nvidia down nearly 60%.So they're all getting shellacked pretty badly here, but now they're saying into 2023 we're going to see them hurt even more as these kind of macroeconomic conditions really start to lay into these companies. So just outside of the larger issue of big name companies buying servers, buying chips for servers and video cards for servers, you have to look at the consumer side of things as well.Story continuesAnd we've already said numerous times that the PC market is just falling flat now from the highs that it had seen. We had Nvidia obviously announced some new chips this past week, pricing for those is very high compared to prior versions of those chips. And at least anecdotally from what I've seen online, a lot of gamers aren't talking about trying to scoop them up right away because of those high prices.Intel is expected to unveil their 13th generation chip this next week, at its Intel Innovate conference. We have AMD obviously talking about their own chips. All of these companies though are running into issues in the same way. The consumers just don't want to buy right now and that will likely continue for the foreseeable future as people decide, look, I can't spend the money on this expensive smartphone.I can't spend the money on this expensive laptop or desktop. I have to hold on for now. And so it's not looking good for these chip companies going forward.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we were talking in our morning meeting, we're going to be talking to the head of the automotive business at Qualcomm a little bit later in the show, Dan. And I think you made some good distinctions there, because it's not as though these issues are necessarily occurring across the board for different--We sort of have to look at different types of chips and what's happening with the different types of chips. As you said the PC demand for chips probably is the most acute area of pain, I would say, for the chip makers. And but they're still focusing on growth businesses like automotive for example, like AI for example. So can you talk to us a little bit about that differentiation?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, and that's a really, really good point. The fact that AI is still going to be a place where a lot of companies are investing. It's still, I mean, you could still call it a relatively nascent technology, just because the point that we're at with AI, it's basically a toddler trying to learn how to walk, maybe even crawl at this point.It's nowhere near where it's expected to go. So a lot of companies are continuing to invest in it just for the sheer fact that it can help them better streamline their own business practices. And I think that's going to see-- be something that we'll continue to see moving forward.And then as you said, obviously, the car industry is a place we're going to continue to see heavy investment. Outside of the issue with chip shortages that continue to hurt the chip industry. There's still a number of factories and plants that have cars idling outside or at least not idling, parked.It'd be a huge waste of gas, but they're parked outside lots just kind of sitting there, waiting for components. But we will continue to see companies push the envelope when it comes to adding more and more chips to their cars. And that should help companies in that space.We're talking about obviously the Qualcomm's, the Nvidia's, even the companies that license software. So think maybe Google, which is working with some automakers, as well as Microsoft. So it could help them in that area. And look, electric cars, obviously, that's the big thing that everybody talks about.But part of the electric car equation is also the self-driving car equation. We're still decades away from actual self-driving cars, but we are seeing the technologies improve. And every time a new technology gets put into a car, it needs a processor.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, good point. And they're going to need a lot more of them coming up as well, which is what a lot of the chip companies are banking on. Thanks, Dan. Appreciate it.]"

Here's Sozz.SHAUN CLOWES: As you can see, everybody here at Dreamforce is talking about how can they have a 360 degree view of their customer and grow efficiently. Everybody's looking to figure out how to automate while still delivering an incredible customer experience. And the average enterprise has to do that on top of about 950 different systems.So imagine you're AT&amp;T, you're a large telecommunications company or a bank, you're trying to deliver great customer service on top of those 950 different systems. MuleSoft helps you make those systems work as one. So it's a great place to be. You know, once you integrate those different systems, you end up being able to deliver your projects about three times-- sorry, 75% faster. It's just dramatically-- a good place to be.BRIAN SOZZI: That was under two minutes. That was really good.SHAUN CLOWES: Thank you.BRIAN SOZZI: So what is your biggest challenge as you look forward to next year?SHAUN CLOWES: I guess the question is-- the big challenge that all of us are facing is exactly how to do what I just described, which is achieve digital transformation and do so with less, right? We're all trying to do more with less. Obviously, we're facing economic headwinds, inflation, the workforce challenges. Everybody's facing all those challenges.And so they're all trying to figure out, OK, I know I need to continue meeting the needs of my customers, but how do I do that efficiently, right? How am I going to actually achieve that, again, on top of those 950 different systems? And so our challenge is helping our customers do that. Our challenge is helping them deliver value from all those things so that their customers continue to get their needs met over and over again.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: You guys, MuleSoft, got a nice shoutout in the last earnings call a couple of weeks ago. It feels and it seems like there's a turnaround brewing. Sales are accelerating. What is driving that?SHAUN CLOWES: Yeah, I mean, the simple case is that in the end, the real world is very complex, like I said. And most enterprises are really complex and getting more complex and still trying to deliver incredible customer experiences. And so MuleSoft has been doing-- for about 16 years, we have been helping organizations take all of those different systems and complex environment and connect it all together so that they can have a 360 degree view of their customer.So for MuleSoft, this is us in our prime. We're doing exactly what we have always set out to do, and we're doing it as part of the broader Salesforce, which obviously has hundreds of thousands of customers where we can surface all of this data to drive a really better customer experience.BRIAN SOZZI: I was talking to Salesforce's co-CEO Bret Taylor about the platform's integrating a lot more. It seems like there's more collaboration between a MuleSoft, a core CRM customer, and also a Slack and Tableau. Is that a fair assessment?SHAUN CLOWES: Absolutely. We're working to make certain that all the different capabilities of all those things you talked about-- Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, and Salesforce-- all work together really seamlessly. Let me give you an example. Some of our customers-- in fact, many probably listening to this interview-- still have mainframes with green screens that are holding important customer data. Like, if you were at the IT keynote, many people were clapping when we talked--BRIAN SOZZI: I don't even think that-- I don't think we could stream on those computers.SHAUN CLOWES: Yeah, I'm pretty sure they don't do video. But regardless, they have all of this important customer data and capabilities in their mainframe. So how do they take that stuff and put it in beautiful digital experiences like mobile apps or in service experiences in Service Cloud? So we released a new tool called MuleSoft Robotic Process Automation that does just that.It takes those mainframes, UI-driven experiences, or PDFs, or images, it gets the data out of those things, and then it surfaces them up for use inside, for example, Salesforce, where it can be automated using Salesforce Flow. You can run workflows off Slack. You can see that same data in Tableau. Realistically, like, the whole idea is to bring this one view of the customer and all of these capabilities together. It's better together.BRIAN SOZZI: I think that's what you're talking about, the team has been talking about, a single source of truth?SHAUN CLOWES: Absolutely, a single source of truth. One place to go, one place to understand what the customer looks like, what they want, and what they need. And with Salesforce Genie, which you heard us talk about a fair bit and I assume others have been talking to you about, we are making this all real time. So that when something happens, you know, your vehicle breaks down or your bank account is overdrawn or you become a VIP with a retailer, when that happens, we can respond in real time.We can send you a gift. We can send somebody to fix your car. We can notify one of the account teams that supports you to call you and tell you that it's OK and we're going to figure it out for you. We're bringing it all together to truly deliver an incredible customer experience. That's what makes moments truly magical. Moments are magical when they respond to what's happening to me as a customer, me as an individual.BRIAN SOZZI: Bigger picture thing, what-- in this era of automation, it's only going to increase. What role do humans play?SHAUN CLOWES: I mean, humans will always be needed to deliver those beautiful human magic moments. Like, humans are best when they're creative, when they're making smart decisions on behalf of their company, on behalf of their customer. So what we really want to do is we want to take away the drudge work. We want to take away the repetitive rote work that employees are forced to do which doesn't really add any value.There's flipping from one system to another. They're copying and pasting data from one system to another. We worked with AT&amp;T, and AT&amp;T were automating some of the work that's done by their B2B sales team. And did you know that they automated a few of the key workflows? They saved 30 minutes per rep per day. I would love to have 30 minutes back myself.BRIAN SOZZI: I got to push-- Shaun, I need somebody on the phone if I call up.SHAUN CLOWES: Yes, but that person is still answering you on the phone. But instead of putting you on hold for 30 minutes, they're instead being able to use a system. That means they can answer your questions immediately. And that means AT&amp;T saves a million hours every year of their reps' time so they can serve you as a customer.SEANA SMITH: Our thanks to Brian Sozzi. He's out there with MoleSoft Chief Product Officer Shaun Clowes at that Salesforce Dreamforce event out on the West Coast.]"

But they can't keep falling forever.And Slack Founder Stewart Butterfield hinted that pretty soon, the valuations on great businesses will be too tempting for investors to ignore.“The multiples have probably come down to something that looks pretty reasonable,” the longtime tech industry executive told Yahoo Finance Live at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference. Slack, which was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion in 2021, has played a starring role at Dreamforce with new platform innovations such as Canvas.Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive officer of Slack, waits to do a television interview after ringing the opening bell the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), June 20, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Butterfield acknowledged that for the technology sector, “the last six months have been pretty rough.”In September, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time since June. Higher interest rates raise the cost of capital for many tech companies that thrive on new funding to spur growth. Further, with rates on a steeper trajectory, as the Fed indicated on Wednesday, the economy could slow quicker than expected and put pressure on elevated tech multiples.Consequently, tech stocks experienced a fresh round of selling this week. Popular tech stocks such as Meta, AMD, Intel, Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Spotify saw declines as the Nasdaq Composite shed more than 5% during the week.“The open question for investors is still: Do we see a change in demand and therefore an actual change in performance?” Butterfield said. “Because the multiples are probably about good, and if we collectively determine that we’re not going to see a real decrease in demand, we’re not going to see a real decrease in economic growth, then I think we have a lot of upside from here.”In Butterfield's view, demand remains solid, underscoring the idea that investors may be missing good fundamental stories.""What tech investors want is visibility into a calm economic environment,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan told Yahoo Finance Live at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference earlier this month.Story continues""Tech, by its very nature, is a risk-premium, risk-on category of investing,"" Sheridan added, ""and when people are uncertain about what's the rate of inflation, what's happening in the macroeconomic environment, what is the Fed going to do — it all trickles into the conversation and it creates uncertainty. As a result, risk comes off, and names sell off in the group. So you really need a stable macro environment where people feel comfortable putting more risk back on in their portfolio.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

We have been covering Salesforce's big Dreamforce conference this week. Well, Yahoo Finance's editor-at-large Brian Sozzi sitting down with Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and getting his take on what it's like being a leader in the tech space, the company's integration into Salesforce, and the future of work. Let's take a listen.STEWART BUTTERFIELD: I make this argument. It goes like this. If, in March of 2020 in some parallel universe, we were allowed to keep on meeting in offices, traveling for work, using conference rooms, commuting, and all that stuff but you took away the software, then every large enterprise would have just disintegrated, like, it would have ceased to exist in 24 hours. I find this very compelling evidence that we, as a matter of objective fact, kept going, and even thrived in many cases, through the pandemic despite the fact that we couldn't go to the office.But if we were allowed to go to the office and you took away the software, it wouldn't have worked. So there is this-- we say digital HQ is a marketing term, but there is this digital infrastructure that supports productivity and collaboration that's really essential that, from my perspective, I think people have underappreciated or underinvested in because it's intangible, because it's invisible.And, look, if you were a manufacturing company, you're relentlessly looking for ways to optimize the factory floor and the productivity. We don't do that so much for knowledge workers. So this is a long answer to your question, but I'm just starting to see that kind of creep into the consciousness. People are realizing the possibilities to transform the way they work, to rethink organizational design, management structures, peer feedback, performance reviews, all that stuff really leveraging the digital technology that we've taken for granted.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: What is the evolution of Slack? So I caught the keynotes. I've talked to your Chief Product Officer Tamar. There seems to be a new evolution-- or an evolution playing out in Slack now that it's really been integrated inside of Salesforce.STEWART BUTTERFIELD: Yeah, I guess there's-- so there's two things. One is you just mentioned the integration into Salesforce, so this kind of deep across the Customer 360, Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, MuleSoft, Tableau, the whole thing. And obviously there's a lot of Slack customers here. There's a lot of Salesforce customers. There's a lot of people who are customers of both. But there's a lot of curiosity about the power of that integration and kind of Slack's traditional idea that we want to be a multiplier on the value of your other software.The other thread, I think, is if you imagine starting to work at a new company where they use Slack, you can scroll back to the last six months of conversation with your team, you have all this archive, all this history, you can search. On the other hand, if you join a company where the primary means of communication is email, you start with an empty inbox. And it's, like, anyone wants to share any of the hundreds of millions of messages you're cut off from, they have to do it one at a time manually. So there is this accretion of value the longer an organization uses Slack.But what we want to do now is look at the 30 hours a week we spend on video calls where there is no-- there's not even a receipt left at the end that says that the call happened and start to think about what can we do to facilitate the curation, collation, collection, organization of the materials that were shared, the notes that were shared, and start to think about a different way of working live that really captures some of that value so that, in my dream, in the future, a couple of years from now, you can get invited to a meeting, and you're, like, no, I'll just catch it after because right now there is no catching it after.BRIAN SOZZI: Why are we still meeting like it's 2019? I just had somebody put something on my Google Calendar. It feels-- it feels outdated.STEWART BUTTERFIELD: It's-- there's such a strong bias towards the status quo. And I think the other part of it is at the extreme, there's, like, the Amazon six-page memo format where you have to know PowerPoint, write it all out. We're going to start the first 10 minutes of the meeting in silence while everyone reads. But we're human beings. So if you have-- like, here's your two choices.Choice A is carefully write out your thoughts and edit them for concision and clarity and be careful to articulate and all your arguments are in order. And then receive the written feedback of your peers and carefully read that and incorporate their thoughts. But the other one is, like, option B, let's have a meeting for 30 minutes. This is, like, Brussels sprouts and broccoli and stuff. And this is, like, a Snickers bar. So people are always going to choose this easier path. So how can we make this path the easy, obvious, simple one?BRIAN SOZZI: Last time I saw you was Davos, and we were just starting to get these return to offices, notably out of the banks, but a lot of other companies. Does that just drive you crazy? Why are we mandating people to get their butts back in the seats in the office when we have tools like yours that we don't need to be in there?STEWART BUTTERFIELD: Yeah, but certainly, the idea of people going back to just hundreds of thousands of square feet of desking, I sometimes say, like, factory farm, battery chicken housing for people to sit and use their laptop by themselves with the headphones on, they're not even talking to each other, that part you could do anywhere. I mean, I think, obviously, there's value to getting together in person, depends on the team and the function.But I feel like there's, in the ideal world, a rhythm where you get together, maybe it's only once a year, maybe it's every other week, and you build up a lot of work to do, you kind of prioritize things. And then the execution mode, give people flexibility because they demand it. We've had the mandates get back to office. And I think outside of a handful of smaller exceptions, San Francisco is 30% still, New York is 50%. There's not significant movement coming on this front.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, now that these platforms have been integrated-- Stewart, you're a serial entrepreneur-- what is it like being an entrepreneur inside of a much larger company?STEWART BUTTERFIELD: It's interesting. Obviously, there's a lot-- there's a lot more inertia. I don't mean that in a critical-- I guess there's a lot more momentum, let's say. And there's, like, the same class of problems to solve at a bigger scale. So I think there's both additional challenges and kind of also additional opportunities.Salesforce is in a really interesting position where I think there's a lot of top-line growth left-- and we've talked about a goal of $50 billion in revenue by fiscal '26-- but also really significant improvement in margins going from 20% just now, 25% in that same time frame that'll have a huge impact on the bottom line.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you miss being a public company?STEWART BUTTERFIELD: I don't know if I miss this particular six-month period.BRIAN SOZZI: You don't miss our chats for earnings?STEWART BUTTERFIELD: I-- well, I do miss that. But, gosh, the last six months have been pretty rough. I got a lot of public company CEO friends, and it's tough.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think when you're-- I'm not saying to predict stock price or bottoms here, but what is going on out there? And what is it going to take for some of these tech stocks to just come out the other side? I mean, is demand that bad to warrant some of these sell-offs?STEWART BUTTERFIELD: I think the multiples have probably come down to something that looks pretty reasonable. A lot of-- I think the average, even for software across the board, is something, like, 5x forward revenue, which is, yeah, compared to-- I don't even know what the average was-- 18 or 20x or something like that at the peak.I think the open question for investors is still, do we see a change in demand, and therefore an actual change in performance because the multiples are probably about good? And if we collectively determine that we're not going to see a real decrease in demand, we're going to see a real decrease in economic growth, then I think we have a lot of upside from here.DAVID BRIGGS: Stewart Butterfield, the Slack CEO, with Brian Sozzi.]"

Shares have lost about 13.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Salesforce Beats Q2 Earnings, Lowers GuidanceSalesforce strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein its revenues and earnings surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a solid year-over-year improvement as well.Quarter in DetailSalesforce’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $1.19 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The quarterly earnings included a benefit of four cents per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. However, non-GAAP earnings declined 19.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.48 per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $7.72 billion climbed 22% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion. The top line also improved 26% in constant currency (cc).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal second quarter. Also, the recently acquired Slack business boosted revenues and contributed $381 million to total sales in the second quarter.Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (92.5% of the total revenues) increased 20.8% from the year-earlier period to $7.14 billion. Professional Services and Other (7.5% of total sales) revenues climbed 35.4% to $577 million.Story continuesUnder the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 15% year over year to $1.7 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud, one of the company’s largest and fastest-growing businesses, also improved 14% to $1.8 billion. Marketing &amp; Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 17% to $1.1 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 53% to $1.5 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 12% year over year to $1 billion.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth at cc of 22% in America (68% of the total revenues), 31% in the Asia Pacific (9%) and 35% in the EMEA (23%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $5.59 billion, up 18.3% from the prior-year period. However, the gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 72%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $1.54 billion, up 19% year over year. However, the non-GAAP operating margin contracted 50 bps to 19.9% due to the lower gross margin. Operating expenses flared up 23% year over year to $5.4 billion.Salesforce exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $13.5 billion, flat with the $13.5 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $334 million and free cash flow of $131 million in the second quarter. In the first half of fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $4.01 billion and $3.63 billion, respectively.As of Jul 31, 2022, the current remaining performance obligation reflecting revenues under contract for the next 12 months was $21.5 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, the company revealed that its board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program worth $10 billion.Guidance UpdateSalesforce trimmed its fiscal 2023 guidance amid unfavorable foreign currency change rates and a weakening IT spending environment.For fiscal 2023, CRM lowered its revenue guidance range to the $30.9-$31 billion range from the $31.7-$31.8 billion. The company forecast that the stronger U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a $800-million negative impact on total revenues. The updated guidance includes expected revenues from the newly acquired Slack business of $1.5 billion.The company decreased its non-GAAP earnings guidance range to the $4.71-$4.73 per share range from the $4.74-$4.76 band projected earlier. It also reduced year-over-year operating cash flow growth projection to 16-17% from the earlier guidance range of 21-22%. However, it reiterated the non-GAAP operating margin forecast for the fiscal year of approximately 20.4%.For the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $7.82 billion and $7.83 billion. The revenue guidance includes a $250-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.20-$1.21 for the current quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.82% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Salesforce.com has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

Before he left, though, he sat down with Slack's chief product officer and talked all things return to work. Take a listen.TAMAR YEHOSHUA: We've been working very closely with our customers to understand what they need. And some people are coming back to the office. Some people are working in this hybrid situation. And some people are fully remote. But what we find is they all need the same thing. They need to be able to collaborate effectively and to have tools to increase productivity.BRIAN SOZZI: What is the next generation of Slack?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: So we're continuing to enhance our tools and enhance our platform so that we can build in more collaboration, more connection. People miss not seeing each other in person. And even if they are going into the office, every time you collaborate, you want to make it feel more personal, more human. So we've added in to our huddles feature, which is a audio first collaboration, the ability to have video and to have fun effects and emoji reactions to make it feel human.BRIAN SOZZI: Is it-- do you still-- do you find it weird that we still have meetings as if it was pre-pandemic?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: A lot has really changed. People think about meetings in a different way. The whole concept of video fatigue is, you really don't like being on screen all the time. And I think people are more open to changing how they meet. And people are talking about how do we have fewer meetings, how do we have more asynchronous meetings.The word ""asynchronous"" was not a word that a lot of people used before the pandemic. Now you hear it from everyone. So a lot of our meetings, we've stopped having, and they've gone asynchronous with video clips. So you just eliminate the meeting altogether. So I find people are more open to change.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: There's this knock on Slack that we're always on Slack. If we're on Slack, we're not maybe getting things done. Where do you stand in this debate?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: So work is communication. And most of our work is communication. And you should be using whatever communication tools you have to increase more effective communication and be off the tools when you need to. When I need to focus, I turn on my Do Not Disturb, and I focus. And there's an etiquette of you know when you have to-- when something's really important and you have to respond.But people are going to use whatever tools they have if they don't want to focus on their job. It's easy to do that with email. It's easy to do that with any tool. So you have to use your tools in a way that make you more productive, of beyond them when it's going to actually help you with your work.BRIAN SOZZI: Be right back. I'm going to check my messages. No, I'm just kidding. But how do you think about-- one thing I've learned or picked up on the keynotes at Dreamforce, talking to folks, is better integration between a Slack, a MuleSoft, a Tableau, and that core CRM software. Is that the right way to think about it? These things are finally starting to integrate and communicate with each other?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: 100%. Slack's platform has always been one of the key parts of Slack and that you can integrate with any third party. So in the very early days of Slack, developers used it for incident management of integrating with all their tools. And we've really focused since the acquisition on integrating with all of the customer 360, all of the clouds. This adds so much value to your productivity.So instead of having to leave where you're engaged and go check another tool, you get a notification right where you are. And you can actually respond with a workflow to whatever that issue is without leaving Slack, so it just increases your efficiency. So that's another big focus of ours is automation.BRIAN SOZZI: How do you keep developers and your software team focused? And this is a challenging time for the economy, the world. But how have you kept them just focused on the mission of what you need to achieve?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: So for us, it's all about the customer. And the closer people are in the product organization, the engineering organization to the customer, the more motivated they are because you see that you're helping them. Yesterday, in the Slack keynote, we had some people from Jansen, some customers who are helping to solve-- eradicate cancer. And nothing could be more motivating than to make them more efficient and more productive. So if you constantly are talking about the customer and how what you're doing really has an impact, then people will focus on building the things that will help the customer.BRAD SMITH: I've asked Stewart Butterfield this numerous times about Slack hacks. He just told me a couple of his. What are some hacks that we're not using that we may should start using?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: Well, one that you probably don't have yet is the huddles that's coming out with the effects, which is bring people together in a video. But one of the things I use a lot is scheduled send because you don't want to bother somebody--BRIAN SOZZI: There's a schedule send on Slack? I didn't--TAMAR YEHOSHUA: Oh, my God. You didn't know that?BRIAN SOZZI: I didn't know.TAMAR YEHOSHUA: Oh, I'm so glad I told you.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm not supposed to say that, but just as an authentic moment, like, I didn't know that.TAMAR YEHOSHUA: Yes, so by the little send, there's a little-- you can-- there's a little carat that you can schedule it whenever you want. So sometimes I catch up on all my messages on the weekend, and I don't want to bother people. So I schedule send it for Monday morning.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow, I didn't-- and it is OK to have your Do Not Disturb on. That's OK.TAMAR YEHOSHUA: 100%.BRIAN SOZZI: You put yours on. When do you set yours?TAMAR YEHOSHUA: I put mine-- goes on every day at 10 o'clock and until the morning, I think it's 7:00 or 8:00. But every night, I have my Do Not Disturb on. If somebody needs to reach me, they can override it. But every night.]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study News'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for News How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for News is:8.3% = US$760m ÷ US$9.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.News' Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROEAt first glance, News' ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Despite this, surprisingly, News saw an exceptional 44% net income growth over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then compared News' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if News is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is News Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?News has a really low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 19%, meaning that it has the remaining 81% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, News has paid dividends over a period of seven years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that News' future ROE will be 7.1% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like News has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

But they can't keep falling forever.And Slack Founder Stewart Butterfield hinted that pretty soon, the valuations on great businesses will be too tempting for investors to ignore.“The multiples have probably come down to something that looks pretty reasonable,” the longtime tech industry executive told Yahoo Finance Live at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference. Slack, which was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion in 2021, has played a starring role at Dreamforce with new platform innovations such as Canvas.Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive officer of Slack, waits to do a television interview after ringing the opening bell the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), June 20, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Butterfield acknowledged that for the technology sector, “the last six months have been pretty rough.”In September, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time since June. Higher interest rates raise the cost of capital for many tech companies that thrive on new funding to spur growth. Further, with rates on a steeper trajectory, as the Fed indicated on Wednesday, the economy could slow quicker than expected and put pressure on elevated tech multiples.Consequently, tech stocks experienced a fresh round of selling this week. Popular tech stocks such as Meta, AMD, Intel, Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Spotify saw declines as the Nasdaq Composite shed more than 5% during the week.“The open question for investors is still: Do we see a change in demand and therefore an actual change in performance?” Butterfield said. “Because the multiples are probably about good, and if we collectively determine that we’re not going to see a real decrease in demand, we’re not going to see a real decrease in economic growth, then I think we have a lot of upside from here.”In Butterfield's view, demand remains solid, underscoring the idea that investors may be missing good fundamental stories.""What tech investors want is visibility into a calm economic environment,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan told Yahoo Finance Live at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference earlier this month.Story continues""Tech, by its very nature, is a risk-premium, risk-on category of investing,"" Sheridan added, ""and when people are uncertain about what's the rate of inflation, what's happening in the macroeconomic environment, what is the Fed going to do — it all trickles into the conversation and it creates uncertainty. As a result, risk comes off, and names sell off in the group. So you really need a stable macro environment where people feel comfortable putting more risk back on in their portfolio.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

And the NASDAQ down 30% year to date. Let's look back at how some big names in the tech space performed and what's ahead for Q4. Tech reporter Dan Howley with us here with what we hope is maybe a little bit of optimism down the road. Hey, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, maybe a little bit further down the road than we would like. But let's talk about some of the big names in tech and how they performed. We look at the biggest one, obviously, Apple. They are suffering but not suffering as badly as some of their competitors. They're only down year to date about 15% as far as stock price goes. They announced their new iPhones, as well as their new Apple Watch and those AirPods.There's hope among analysts that into the holiday season, they'll see good sales of this, at least steady sales. This is the iPhone 14. They're hoping that it matches up as equally with the iPhone 13 as far as sales volumes go, especially in China and the US. We've also seen, obviously, Amazon take a big hit. That company's stock price, that's down around 32% year to date.They took a hit throughout the year because of some of those issues that we talked about with the actual sales side of things, the e-commerce side of things, where they weren't performing as well as during the pandemic. And they expanded largely to meet the demand for the pandemic. And so now they have to scale that back and kind of recalibrate.We also look at Google. Obviously, they've been hit as part of the kind of rearranging that's going on as a result of Apple's privacy changes in iOS 14. That stock price is down around 30%. Meta, that's really been slammed. That's going back to that Apple privacy change. They're down around 50% year to date.And then we look at something along the lines of an NVIDIA, which is also down more than 50% year to date. They've been slammed as a result of the chip issues that have been ongoing, as well as their forecasts that they're not seeing as robust sales as they wanted to prior to their most recent quarter. They had announced changes there. You know, it's all across the board here. Microsoft down as well. That's looking around 29%. And then we can look at, obviously, next to the S&amp;P 500, the only one that's looking good is Apple, which is actually trending above it.]"

Yet persistent reimbursement pressure and competitive market offer tough challenges for Walgreens Boots. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens Boots exited third-quarter fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The U.S. pharmacy arm benefited from improved seasonal script trends. The U.S. retail business gained traction through digital and omnichannel growth from myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and other profit streams.The company experienced improved online growth momentum with digital sales up 25% in the United States. Robust performance across health and wellness and personal care categories during the quarter instilled optimism. Further, the continued acceleration of automated microfulfillment centers was another notable upside during the quarter.Walgreens Boots also played a significant role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 4.7 million vaccinations and 3.9 million tests in the last reported quarter and more than 16 million boosters till the Q3 earnings release. The Boots business continued its rally in the fiscal third quarter, with robust sales growth across Boots UK and Boots.com.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteFurther, sales contributions from the newly-formed Walgreens Health segment instill investors’ optimism. The rollout of VillageMD continued to progress well in the fiscal third quarter. VillageMD had a total of 315 clinics opened by the quarter-end, indicating an increase of 97 clinics from the year-ago period.The intensifying competition in the U.S. retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings. In June 2022, the company noted that the Walgreens Health business had signed on Buckeye Health Plan as its third payer partner. This collaboration has raised the lives under coverage to 2.3 million, exceeding the company’s 2022 target. Beyond Health Corners, the collaboration also includes asthma and COPD patients as part of a multi-phased approach to support comprehensive expanded clinical services.In April 2022, Walgreens expanded its partnership with ALTO US to broaden its effort to address theft and organized retail crime across more than 2,200 stores nationwide.Story continuesOn the flip side, over the past six months, Walgreens Boots has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 28.5% compared with the industry’s 11.5% decline.Walgreens Boots’ fiscal third-quarter revenues fell shy of estimates and declined year over year. The top-line performance was affected by a sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens. Within the Pharmacy business, scripts continued to be challenged by temporary operating hour reductions owing to labor shortages. The company incurred a $683 million charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in the reported quarter.Contraction of gross margin does not bode well. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.8% year over year in the quarter under review. These mounting expenses resulted in an operating loss in the quarter, building pressure on the bottom line.We note that in the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins as well. Additionally, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation in recent times have been hampering Walgreens’ margin significantly.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

After taking the recent loss into consideration, the US$21m worth of stock they bought is now worth US$23m, indicating that their investment yielded a positive return.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Starbucks The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StarbucksIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when CEO, Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz bought US$10.0m worth of shares at a price of US$73.10 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$84.70), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 274.75k shares worth US$21m. On the other hand they divested 26.96k shares, for US$3.0m. In total, Starbucks insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Starbucks Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Starbucks. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$6.0m for shares in the company -- and none sold. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider Ownership Of StarbucksFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Starbucks insiders own about US$2.0b worth of shares (which is 2.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Starbucks Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about Starbucks. Looks promising! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

That's RBC Capital Markets Lori Calvasina, who's joining us right now. Lori, good morning. It's good to see you.So you just heard our conversation that we were having. You've been hearing about some of your peers on the street that have been lowering their forecast for year end. That dramatic comment from Bank of America, that sentiment is the worst it's been since the financial crisis. What are you hearing? Are you-- are you seeing that kind of negative sentiment also?LORI CALVASINA: Well, sure. And I mean, just to pick up on the Bank of America comment, like, we don't really track the flows, but we do track the sentiment as tracked by the AAII net bull bear survey. And we've actually been talking for a few months now how if you look at that survey, retail investor sentiment has been tracking down around financial crisis lows. So to be honest, that's not really new news in here.And I think that as you navigate this environment, I like the Goldman comment about this being an unusually murky environment. I think we've got this challenge from the Fed on interest rates. We've got this murky economic impact. People certainly have their opinions there, but there's definitely a disconnect between expectations and what's going on in the here and now.And then if you think about maybe potential things that could turn this market around by year end, I'd say, look at the midterm elections. That was something that investors were getting quite excited about over the summer thinking the Republicans were going to have a good showing. Typically as well, we tend to see that markets bottom in early October in a midterm election year, and then rally about 7% into year end. Now that's an average.Story continuesBut we did hear quite a few investors talking about that over the summer, even back in June and July when they were still pretty bearish and markets were kind of dancing around those June lows. So I would say keep an eye on the election as we get closer. The kind of consensus that the Republicans are going to do well has been getting chipped away at.My hunch is that the Republicans are still at least going to take the House and that may end up being good enough for investors just to give them something frankly to latch on to at a time when valuations are probably going to start to look interesting again.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it's always particularly interesting how the markets may cheer on logjam in Washington DC or nothing happening because that just being kind of a neutralizing effort. However, I think on the other side, there are so many investors, even with kind of the neutralizing if you were to see logjam in DC or even more of a stalemate in DC, there's a larger question of where some of the efforts that have already been moved forward in order to make sure that there are significant changes made.Whether that be in energy infrastructure, or whether that be in electric vehicles, or in chip manufacturing, and kind of quelling for some of the supply chain concerns. When that will actually start to show up for companies and be a net benefit for the major equity players that are out there that are looking for some of those supply chains to ease as well?LORI CALVASINA: Well, I think on the topic of supply chains, I wouldn't so much focus on Washington and anything that's being done there. But I think if you look at our digital intelligence strategy team's work, they've been tracking a number of different indicators on supply chains that do show that things are getting better.Freight rates are starting to track down year-over-year. And if you just look at company commentary, a lot of companies are saying that while things are still tough versus history, they are starting to get better out at the margin.I think we had one company at our industrial conference say, everything's looking better on supply chains a little bit except for semiconductors. So I do think those things are starting to work their way into the system, regardless of what goes on in Washington in the future. And I think it will take a little bit of time for those to show up in the data, on the earnings side in particular, but I do think the wheels have started to turn there.JULIE HYMAN: You said in your latest note, which was your weekly notes, so it came out I believe last Sunday, the valuations were starting to look interesting. And I guess if you liked valuations at the beginning of the week, you like even more at the end of the week when stocks that have fallen by 3%. But I am curious if that calculus changes at all given what we heard from the Fed?LORI CALVASINA: So when we look at valuations, you know, I think you look at the multiples separately, then you look at the interest rates, and then you can bake them all together. But if you just look at multiples on their own and where we've been tracking, there are a bunch of different ways you can track the PE.If you take a PE against this year's earnings and our estimate of 218, which is pretty far below consensus, we were starting to track a little bit below average at the end of last week, if you look at the long-term average in terms of how you crunch that particular multiple. Now if you look at where the market has been trading against next year's earnings and they were at 212, so we're also materially below the consensus.We're one of the lowest numbers on the street there. You are still a little bit above average, but we calculated that you would be getting below average if the S&amp;P hit about, I think, 3561. So we're not quite there yet, but I think that is one marker you can keep in mind as you continue to see markets sort of seize up in terms of the volatility in the very short-term.And I bring that up, Julie, because when I talk to investors over the summer, again, kind of thinking back to kind of the June lows, people were not telling me that they wanted to see dramatically lower valuations. They wanted reasonable valuations, but they wanted some certainty.Now if you layer into the Fed, I have been talking about this all week with investors, interest rates are a good rough tool to tell you where kind of the right neighborhood valuation should be in, but they're not a very precise tool. So one model that we have that actually looks at core PCE, if you sort of bake in 4 and 1/2 percent, which I think is what was actually in the Fed's summary of economic projections.And that's been kind of the consensus number in Bloomberg for a while. If you take that, plug that into a regression and look at data going back all the way to the '60s, it tells you we should have a six times average trailing PE in the S&amp;P at the end of the year. And that's actually pretty similar to what a lot of investors were telling me over the summer they thought was a reasonable multiple to pay.So I do know that there's a lot of concern over interest rates right now and how it weighs on multiples, but I will tell you, it's a wait, but it is a very imprecise tool. It's a very blunt tool, not a precise one.BRAD SMITH: Lori, just while we have you. I mean, we're about to go into the next earnings season just about two weeks from now essentially. And I think about all of the companies that have either already kind of dampened what their outlook may look like for the rest of this year or just where they're reiterating some of their guidance for some companies.But largely we've already seen materials companies come out and kind of decrease their guidance, decrease their outlook. We heard from FedEx earlier this week and through their earnings yesterday describing the macroeconomic outlook as well. What are your expectations going into this earnings season? And what should the results that-- be that we expect coming out of it?LORI CALVASINA: Sure. So our number, again, this year is at 218, and I think the bottom up consensus has been tracking around to 228. So there is definitely a disconnect. And we do think numbers need to come down.I would say, reporting season gets lumpy sector by sector. We're probably going to hear from a lot of financials first and industrials. Again, the tone out of our industrial conference last week was very, very positive. So I think if you hear anything other than that it is going to be a negative shock to the system.The financials, though, if you look at the setup coming in, we've been seeing pretty healthy rates of upward revisions, especially for small and mid-cap banks. So again, you know, I don't necessarily expect anything to be bad there. But if we were to sort of see some negative commentary come in, I think that would run counter to the trend that's been in the market recently.Look, I think that investors want earnings numbers' kitchen sinked. They want the Band-Aid ripped off. They want realistic numbers for next year, and this year frankly, so that they can really make a true assessment of valuations. So while there might be some short-term volatility just if we work some of these expectations down, I do think ultimately that's healthy for the market.BRAD SMITH: RBC Capital Markets, Lori Calvasina. Lori, always a pleasure to speak with you and get your perspective on what's taking place more broadly here. Appreciate it.]"

A rough end to the week is what it is looking like this morning. We are seeing Dow futures point to a lower open here, down by 400 points right now. S&amp;P futures up 1.4%, NASDAQ futures down by 1.3%.If we look at the five-day chart, Brad, we have seen that this week obviously has been rough. Post Fed, pre Fed, but really post Fed the losses accelerating.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, if we can pop back over to the S&amp;P 500 actually. I know we were taking a look at the futures there, but maybe we can even just take a look more broadly at the S&amp;P 500. Yesterday we had actually taken out some of the July lows that we had even seen.And so now getting even back into that territory, looking at this broader kind of year-to-date view, that's exactly what we're going to be keeping close tabs on from this point. You're seeing that July low that we had ultimately retested yesterday and we'll see exactly where things net out at the end of today's trading session.But again we've seen more of that slippage. The dippity dip is my key technical term that we've continued to see resurface over the past couple of sessions here. But all of that triggered, not just on, of course, last week where we were seeing some of the economic data that was moving into the Fed's decision, but that Fed decision, of course, that you were mentioning this week. And ultimately the pathway forward from here that they've set forth, as evidence through dot plot data as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, And let's take a look at bond just to put a fine point on that with the 10-year T note, 3.75%. So here's the year today chart and the last time we've been there. I don't know how far we have to go back. So it's not the five-year chart. Maybe it's on the 10-year chart, not on the 10-year chart.Story continuesMaybe it's on the 20-year chart. Yeah, there we go it's on the 20-year chart. So this is the lowest that we have seen-- or the highest that we've seen that 10-year yield going back, what, just eyeballing this, looks like financial crisis times.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, 2008, 2009, right in that ballpark there. So continue to keep a close eye on that. Here are three things that you need to know right now as we begin today's show. We've got quite a few notes, including one from Goldman Sachs cutting its S&amp;P 500 year-end target to 3,600. This is down from its previous forecast of 4,300.As part of its reasoning, Goldman Sachs says that the interest rate path is now higher than it had originally forecasted there. And this is extremely noteworthy especially as we think through where banks have continued to monitor, not just what their forecasts were prior to and coming into some of the most recent waves of Fed decisions.But what could also be some of the catalysts as well, especially as we've already seen some of the global picture and that global slowdown really impact companies, and there's this larger question of with the targets that the banks are setting forth now and especially from Goldman Sachs here on the day.If the companies that have even provided enough of that kind of forward guidance that actually reflects the real state of how their end consumers are feeling. How their business is going to have to navigate this near term period where we are continuing to see some of that margin compression.That is going to be exactly what gets priced into even more of the year-end targets. And the question is, what type of equity market activity do we see to that point, once we get to the end of the year? And the slippage that we've seen even now, because right now we're sitting at this point in time for the S&amp;P 500 still off of some of those targets sitting at about 3,700, just above that right now.And so to get to 3,600, that would still be even more of that downturn that Goldman Sachs foresees. And we'll see what other banks as well start to reiterate or reposition some of their own end targets.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, we've had a little bit of that repositioning already. For example, Julian Emanuel of Evercore ISI cut his target earlier in the week as well. So we're starting to see this. I mean, we don't have that much more of the year to go, right? Until we get to these targets. But nonetheless, it just reflects this rapidly changing environment.And in the note, I mean, basically David Kostin, the team over there at Goldman, saying the expected path of interest rates is higher than we previously assumed. Yes, indeed, that seemed to be what is happening for everyone. They also said the outlook is unusually murky and that seems to be affecting, not just strategists and big banks, but companies, [INAUDIBLE] and everyone else.And then the other note that was getting our attention this morning is Bank of America coming out and talking about the enormous amount that people are holding in cash right now, because of the extreme levels of pessimism. The strategists over there say, investor sentiment is unquestionably the worst it's been since the financial crisis.BRAD SMITH: Right. And they were--JULIE HYMAN: Pretty dramatic to say that.BRAD SMITH: Exactly. And they were tracking some of the outflows and the inflows, cash inflows particularly, is what they were seeing there, $30 billion worth of cash inflows. However, equity funds, global equity funds seeing outflows of $7.8 billion. Now that's the week through September 21 and they were citing some EPFR Global data.But you think about all of what would have to take place and whether we're kind of set up for what we had seen as well in 2018, where even in a rising interest rate environment back then, there was a lot of question marks around some of the sectors that could be set forth the biggest declines.And for the tech sector, and we're going to talk about semiconductors a little bit later on, there could be even more of that almost similar or analogous movement to the downside in tech that we had seen towards the tail end of 2018. And what would be the backstop? What would be the catalyst for some of the companies or for some of the investors out there to start to nibble at some of those opportunities in tech? It doesn't seem to be a clear catalyst on the table right now.]"

Previously, the primary accounting exec at Netflix was JC Berger, VP of finance and global controller, who left the company in June after 15 years.In recent months, Netflix has taken several measures to cut costs after seeing its subscriber base shrink slightly in the first half of 2022. The company has laid off around 500 staffers, including 30 employees in its animation group earlier this month. The streamer took a $70 million charge in Q2 related to layoffs, as well as an $80 million non-cash impairment charge for “certain real estate leases primarily related to rightsizing our office footprint.” Netflix lost 200,000 subs in Q1 and shed 970,000 in Q2 (although that was about 1 million fewer than it had previously forecast). The company expects to gain 1 million subscribers in the current quarter.Barker, before his short-lived tenure at Netflix, had been a longtime executive at Electronic Arts, most recently as senior VP finance at the games company, and as SVP and chief accounting officer from June 2003 to August 2021.

We've got a new bull on Netflix. Evercore ISI citing the upcoming ad supported tier and password sharing crackdown as reducing user churn. The move comes as Netflix struggles to retain dominance in an increasingly competitive streaming space.Let's bring in Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI senior managing director and head of internet research. Mark, it's good to talk to you today. Early on this year, you mentioned-- you were kind of critical of Netflix, saying that they have been slow to pivot in this changing landscape. But it sounds like you see real levers here with this ad supported tier, a crackdown on password sharing. What are you seeing?MARK MAHANEY: That's right, Akiko. I think that's the right setup. And I also fully agree with what your prior guest, Scott Wagner, said about you need safety. Megacap can maybe help you. I'm looking at names that have been really beaten down. And Netflix is probably at the top of that list, down 70% at one point year to date. Now it's had a 40% rally recently, and it's because of this ad supported business that they're rolling out. So, look, you've got Netflix now that's finally beaten down to a place where you could buy it at a PE multiple, like, 16, 17 times earnings, first time in the company's history.And then you've got a new revenue stream. One of the big problems that Netflix has had, has created for itself is that they've raised prices consistently over time. They're the leading streaming service globally, but they've kind of painted themselves into this kind of premium price, premium product corner. Offering a lower price ad supported solution gets them out of that corner. I think expectations are still super low. And so I think this is just a great upside opportunity for the company and for the stock. It's the most identifiable catalyst that I see out in consumer tech today.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: So let's walk through your thesis of it. You said 20% of churn users are likely to return to Netflix with this cheaper ad supported model. That means 10 million incremental subscriber net adds, $1 to $2 billion in incremental revenue. How much of that churn, you think, or return back to Netflix comes from previous subscribers? How much of it is about bringing in new subscribers on board for those who may have said before, this is a little too much for me?MARK MAHANEY: Well, Akiko, it's almost impossible to know that. And in all honesty, none of us know what the real price point is going to be for Netflix. We don't know how they're going to market it. So there's a lot of what ifs in the analysis. But what was interesting to me is the survey work I've done for 12 years, we have seen since the beginning of 2018, rising price sensitivity amongst Netflix customers. And we've seen declining satisfaction, at least in their most mature markets, like the US.And then when we looked at what the other streaming companies are doing, they're able to generate $5 to $10 in ad revenue per user. And so the light bulb that went off in our heads was, wait a second, Amazon could-- I'm sorry, Netflix could lower its pricing, its subscription pricing by $2 to $3 and still generate more revenue per user because they can get $5 plus in ad revenue per sub.So we've got something that kind of addresses the price sensitivity and is positive for unit economics. I don't think that was captured in the company's valuation. I still don't think it is. And I don't think it's captured in Street estimates. That was kind of the upside call for us on Netflix.AKIKO FUJITA: So Mark, price sensitivity is one thing. And you point to the declining satisfaction among those users. But what about the actual quality of the content? I mean, this is a company that spends about, what, $17 billion in content. Some would argue that they have really gone for quantity over quality. That's at the core of the churn.MARK MAHANEY: That's possible. Now, that's why we do the survey work. So, Akiko, that we've surveyed 2,000 people in the US and in other countries. And we've done this for 12 years. And we ask people, why did you leave? Why would you leave? What would get you to come back? And what has, and for the first time, just in the last year or two, shown up as the number one factor is price sensitivity.And then we do also ask people to rank all of the streaming services in terms of the perceived quality of content. I mean, that's really a judgment call for all of us, which where really is the best content in terms of streaming.But the objective answer we try to get at through surveys clearly shows that Netflix is perceived as having content as good or better than anybody else. And I'm not terribly surprised by that. They've been longer in the streaming than anybody else.Now there are some wonderful other streaming companies like HBO and Disney+, but Netflix is spending probably about the industry high in terms of $17 billion in cash spend per year. And every once in a while, it produces these mega-hits-- ""Bird Box,"" ""Stranger Things,"" ""Squid Games."" And I think what's happened to the stock is people kind of forgot about that. There's probably another ""Squid Games"" out there. The odds are that there is I sometimes think about it is 17 billion shots on goal. Something's likely to go through for Netflix. So that's kind of part of the call.AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, that's a fair point. I don't think anybody would have predicted the big hit that ""Squid Game"" would become. You were on with us earlier this year, saying Netflix is no longer a premium growth story. Does that [INAUDIBLE] change, you think, as a result of the potential catalyst you see coming from the ad supported tier, as well as the crackdown on password sharing? Are we still talking about below 20% plus?MARK MAHANEY: Yeah, Akiko, thanks for pointing that out. No, I don't think that Netflix gets back to premium growth. I don't think it gets back to 20%. As a stock picker or as a potential stockholder, what you should think about is if they were, the stock is going dramatically higher. So why? Because the Street right now is looking for 8%, 9%, 10% revenue growth. I think that ad supported-- particularly ad supported offering, but also some password sharing crackdown, they have to be really careful about that. You have to do that right.But if they get those out, that could bring growth back up to kind of 15%. So this isn't the go-go days for Netflix. They had them. It was the best performing stock of the S&amp;P 500 last decade. I doubt it will be this decade. It won't be able to generate that kind of growth that they did so consistently over the years.But this stock can still nicely outperform from here. You want these dislocated stocks that have been beaten down that have got reasonable valuations and are starting to generate real interesting free cash flow stories. That's the setup on Netflix, a stock that's been hated, but starting to turn. And I think this turn could go on for quite some time.AKIKO FUJITA: Finally, Mark, when you look at the broader streaming space, Amazon has seen a lot of success in the first two weeks of Thursday Night Football. Obviously, that has been a big catalyst to get more on board with Prime. You look at Apple moving aggressively on sports, whether it's MLB or MLS. You think Netflix can continue to stay on the sidelines when it comes to sports streaming?MARK MAHANEY: It's possible that this gives them the entree in the sports. I talked with the management team about this numerous times over the years. The one pushback they've always had is we're an on-demand streaming service. Like, you come on when you want to watch something, and it's on your schedule, your time, your schedule. And sports isn't built that way. Sports is on the team's schedule.So it's kind of a different value proposition. It's also extremely expensive. I think Netflix doesn't need to get into sports. I may be wrong on that. And I've seen Netflix pivot. They refuse to get into advertising until they finally did earlier this year. So they've refused to get into sports. It's possible that they change that going forwards. But I don't think we'll see that kind of pivot from them in the next couple of years. I think they're all in on advertising. And they're going to run this and see how well that goes.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, they talked about sports adjacent content, not necessarily live sports. But we'll see if that shift happens. Mark, it's always good to have you on the show. Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI senior managing director and head of internet research.]"

The streaming giant has begun changing its compensation plan for the specials, now licensing some for two years for $200,000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us now. OK, Allie, what do we know about this so far?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Brad, this really is part of Netflix's larger goal to cut costs for the sake of profitability. So according to this Wall Street Journal report, this new licensing plan will shift some of that financial burden onto the comedian. So they will have to pay for their own production costs, which is something Netflix previously covered. In return, though, the comics will have more control over their work.So once this two-year licensing period ends, they will regain full ownership of that content and can then shop that out to other outlets and platforms. We know comedy has been such a crucial element for Netflix. They've heavily invested in this space, hosting specials from Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Pete Davidson, just to name a few. Whitney Cummings was cited by the Journal as one of the comedians who will receive this two-year licensing deal.And just to put this into further perspective, the streamer previously bought these comedy specials outright. So they would pay performers a lump sum. That lump sum could amount to as much as $1 million to help with some of those production costs, sometimes more, depending on the comic. So this is really just another option. Certainly, more cost effective for Netflix. There are some pros and cons there for performers. So we'll see.I think Netflix will want to buy some deals outright, especially for some of those more popular standup comedians. But the flexibility of choice very important here, as Netflix gets more aggressive with cutting costs. And also important to note that some of those other streamers that you're seeing on your screen, like Amazon, Apple TV+, they'll now have greater access to some of this talent. So perhaps it could shake up the landscape a bit there, too.BRAD SMITH: All right, a lot to keep track of in the streaming space as of right now. Allie Canal, thanks for keeping tabs on it and breaking it all down for us.]"

Naturally, that means many people are looking for the best biotech stocks to buy.But as with the PC industry of my time, finding long-term winners is difficult.Back in the early 1980s, dozens of companies entered the PC market, many of them huge for their time. IBM (NYSE:IBM) was the bet everyone made. But the BUNCH — Burroughs, Univac, NCR (NYSE:NCR), Control Data and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), were all involved. Almost all of them gave way to newcomers Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Apple went public in 1980 and Microsoft in 1986.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSimilarly, there are huge companies involved in today’s biotech boom. But size is no guarantee of future leadership. There are also big differences between today’s boom and the one that came before. Regulation — the need for drug or device approval — is just one of them.An investor is thus wise to spread their bets and be ready to bail at the first sign of failure. Many will be called to the throne of biotech riches. Few will be chosen. Young biotech scientists, like my own son, can expect to have long resumes years before they reach my age.While PCs and biotech offer similar profit opportunities, the need for government involvement makes them very different. So does the nature of the work. There are opportunities in equipment, in the production of molecules, and in the results of basic research as well as drugs.I have compared many new biotechs to oil wildcatters in 1930s Texas because they’re taking big risks and can be sunk by a single failure. This puts today’s large drug companies in better shape to survive than mainframe companies were 40 years ago. Their cash can turn what looks like a losing play into a winner.Here’s my list of the best biotech stocks to buy.Best Biotech Stocks: iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB)Piggy banks with coins in them that spell out ETF.Source: Maxx-Studio / ShutterstockStory continuesStarting a gallery of the best biotech stocks with an exchange-traded fund (ETF) can seem like a form of giving up. But, as with the PC business, it may be the best path to success.BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) tracks a market-weighted index of biotech stocks listed on U.S. exchanges. These are subject to capping requirements, with no more than 8% in any one stock. The expense ratio is low at 0.44%, and there are $7.94 billion of assets under management.SPDR S&amp;P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI), the Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology &amp; Genome ETF (NYSEARCA:PBE) and ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (NYSEARCA:SBIO) are other examples of biotech ETFs you can buy with a few clicks.What all these funds, including IBB, have in common is a rotten 2022. IBB is down 31% so far in 2022. Among the companies it has positions in are Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB).Many of IBB’s holdings have drugs in the market. Others have drugs about to be approved, or in late-stage testing. As new leaders emerge, funds like IBB buy them, and as companies fall out of favor IBB sells them. They’re not trying to beat the market, just match it. If you don’t know what you’re doing (and no one does), matching the market is a good strategy.CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)the CRISPR Therapeutics logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comCRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) was founded in 2012 around the Nobel Prize-winning research of Emmanuelle Charpentier, a French scientist who shared her prize with Jennifer Doudna of the University of California at Berkeley.CRISPR is an acronym short for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.” CRISPR-Cas9, the technique for which Charpentier and Doudna won their award, allows the chemical editing of DNA.CRSP is thus seen by some investors as the “Apple of DNA editing,” but the future is unknown. It could end up like IMSAI or Cromemco, depending on how things play out.For now, the company is doing well. It had revenue of $915 million in 2021, and $4.70 per share, fully diluted, of net income. That means it’s selling for under six times sales and just 18 times earnings.Despite this, CRSP is down nearly 80% from its 2021 high as investors have abandoned development-stage biotech companies. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), with which CRISPR is partnering, plans to file this year for approval on drugs targeting sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia. An investor day over the summer showed promise with drugs for diabetes and kidney cancer.Best Biotech Stocks: Merck (MRK)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) is not technically a biotech, but it illustrates an important trend for biotech investors. That is, companies like CRISPR lack the resources to get drugs tested and past regulators. (Pioneering PC makers could just slap something together and sell them through ComputerLand.) Larger companies are often needed as partners, and this requirement offers incumbents with cash the opportunity to dominate.At the start of July, Merck was worth $234 billion, with annual sales of nearly $49 billion from drugs like Keytruda, a cancer drug, Gardasil, a vaccine for human papillomavirus, and the anti-diabetic medicine Januvia. But, given that patents offer only 20 years of exclusivity on new compounds, Merck is constantly on the hunt for new drugs.The current Merck pipeline includes 83 drugs in Phase-2 study, where drugs are given to people with the condition being treated, with 30 in Phase-3 studies testing safety and efficacy, and 3 programs under review by regulators.But Merck’s most important asset may be its cash, with over $10 billion at the end of June. This can be used to buy out other companies and to fund their research. With the whole biotech sector on its back in the current market, this is a huge opportunity.For investors, Merck also sports a price-to-earnings multiple under 14 and offers a dividend yield of over 3%. It’s a value stock.Amgen (AMGN)AMGN stockSource: ShutterstockAmgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is large like Merck but was born in the biotech era.It was founded in 1980. Its first success with DNA led to the development of drugs like Epogen, used to treat anemia associated with chemotherapy and kidney failure. The company’s sales in 2021 were nearly $26 billion, led by the arthritis drug Enbrel and Prolia for thinning bones. The company’s pipeline includes over a dozen drugs in Phase-3 trials.As with Merck, Amgen also has a lot of cash, $5.2 billion at the end of June. Its $7.76/year dividend yields 3.4% and its price-to-earnings ratio is 19.33.Lately, Amgen has been focusing on its induced proximity platform, shunning what it calls “low-hanging fruit” in hopes of finding compounds that can treat multiple diseases for which there are currently no treatments. It’s also in the biosimilars space, working on a drug that will mimic the action of AbbVie’s (NASDAQ:ABBV) blockbuster Humira. Biosimilars can improve the rate at which patented drugs are replaced by generics.Best Biotech Stocks: Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comIonis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) illustrates the promise and the risk in today’s biotech market.Ionis is best known for Spinraza, licensed to Biogen for the treatment of spinal muscular dystrophy in 2016. Sales in 2021 were $810 million but came with a loss of $29 million, 20 cents per share, as the company continued to spend heavily on new drugs.These include a rare disease drug called eplontersen, for which it has partnered with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). Ionis took $200 million for it last year with the hope of $3.4 billion more if it achieves clinical milestones. The target is a usually-fatal hereditary disease called ATTRv-PN. It is also working with Biogen on an ALS drug called tofersen.Unfortunately, Ionis has also failed on at least four drugs in the last year. This has caused some analysts to back away, with three telling investors to sell.Exelixis (EXEL)The logo for Exelixis is displayed on a phone.Source: Shutterstock.comExelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) is best known for cabozantinib, a kinase inhibitor used to treat some types of thyroid, kidney and liver cancers. Exelixis is a good example of a biotech seeking to capitalize and expand on a single big success.A kinase inhibitor blocks the action of a type of enzyme, in this case, tyrosine. The best-known kinase inhibitor is Merck’s keytruda. These drugs often have side effects that require study and can inhibit effectiveness. While cabozantinib was first approved in 2012 for some thyroid cancers, Exelixis had to lay off 70% of its employees in 2014 after it failed a Phase-3 trial for prostate cancer.By 2021, however, Exelixis had sales of over $1.4 billion and a net income of $231 million, or 72 cents per share. It has a market cap of $5 billion and a PE ratio of 20.At the end of June, Exelixis had $1.5 billion of cash and securities on the books. The cash let it begin an investigation of three compounds from BioInvent’s n-CoDeR library of antibodies. The company is also involved in patent suits aimed at protecting its cabozantinib franchise and has begun a Phase-3 trial on a new tyrosine inhibitor for colorectal cancer.Best Biotech Stocks: Twist Bioscience (TWST)a visualization of DNA in a vialSource: Connect world / Shutterstock.comTwist Bioscience (NASDAQ:TWST), founded in 2013, manufactures synthetic DNA, a manufacturing process that lets companies speed the production of DNA for study. In 2021 it had sales of $133 million and lost $152 million, or $3.15 per share. Its market cap at the end of June 2021 was $2 billion. In Nov. 2021, at the height of the tech boom, it was over $5.5 billion.Twist is one of the hundreds of companies, public and private, aiming to supply other drug companies with key research and production technology. As with companies that seek to create and sell drugs, there is enormous risk, but there are also huge markets on offer.Twist stock bounced at the end of June when it announced a deal to license its antibody libraries to Ildong Pharmaceutical, a Korean company. Twist will get milestone, maintenance, and possible royalty payments in the deal. It also signed a partnership agreement with Astellas Pharmaceutical (OTCMKTS:ALPMY) of Japan in May, and it has a supply agreement with Gingko Bioworks (NYSE:DNA).On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in AAPL, MSFT and MRNA.

So while the Merge has not been deflationary by textbook definition, it has slowed ETH’s inflation rate considerably.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell 2.79% on the day.Economic Calendar: The economic calendar was light today, but there were a couple of items worth considering.The private sector business activity continues to contract, but not at the rate that was expected. The S&amp;P Global U.S. Composite PMI, which tracks data from manufacturing and service companies, was 49.3 in September. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion of business, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction.September’s reading was higher than August’s reading of 44, and above expectations for 48. Ironically, business expansion is not ideal for risk assets at the moment, as it will likely prolong the Federal Reserve’s current fight against inflation.U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 480 points, a 1.6% drop that sent the index to its lowest point of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&amp;P 500 both slipped about 2%.Story continuesCommodities: Energy sold off as well, with WTI crude oil falling 5.4%. Natural gas declined 3.4%, while European Brent crude and gasoline (RBOB) fell 4.4% and 4.7%, respectively. Despite its safe-haven reputation, gold fell 1.8%. Copper, used as a barometer of economic conditions, decreased 3.6%.The Dollar Index (DXY) was stronger, increasing 1.18% and at one point changing hands at 113.23, a 20-year high.Latest Prices● Bitcoin (BTC): $18,895 −1.9%● Ether (ETH): $1,304 −1.6%● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $945 −1.3%● S&amp;P 500 daily close: 3,693.23 −1.7%● Gold: $1,652 per troy ounce −1.1%● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.70% −0.01Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.Technical TakeThe USD Continues to Offer the Clearest Signal on BTC PricesThe macroeconomic narrative saturating every pore of crypto-asset markets is difficult to ignore.With the Federal Reserve trying to stave off inflation by raising interest rates and reducing the size of its $8 trillion balance sheet, risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, will continue to come under pressure.As interest rates increase, holding the U.S. dollar becomes more attractive because of rising yields. Speaking on Friday’s First Mover program, Coindesk’s Lawrence Lewitinn likened the current bid behind the dollar to investors who purchased UST in search of higher yield.The correlative or causative relationship between the two assets remains unclear, but also cannot be easily ignored.For starters, bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) have an almost completely inverse relationship currently. As recently as November 2021, the opposite could be said as BTC and DXY prices moved relatively in tandem.Ultimately, the relationship appears to be between BTC and an increase in a risk-on appetite, with the impact occurring via the relationship between BTC and the U.S. dollar. Given the on again/off again relationship between the two assets, traders will likely be watching for correlations to shift again.On a technical basis, BTC appears to be trading near fair value as mentioned in Wednesday’s Market Wrap. Bitcoin’s weekly chart going back to July of 2021 shows an asset trading near an area of significant price agreement.BTC options open interest by strike price. (Glassnode)Absent a new bullish catalyst, there doesn’t appear to be much incentive for investors to push prices higher at the moment.Derivatives markets show some appetite for risk, but little that counters a “neutral for now” narrative. Looking at Glassnode’s BTC open interest by strike price chart, there appears to be elevated put buying at the $18,000 strike price.A put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specific price. Were bitcoin prices to fall below $18,000, those put options would likely be exercised, putting additional downside pressure on the markets.Call option purchases (i.e. the right but not the obligation to buy) begin to increase at the $19,500 strike price, a 4% premium to current prices.Altcoin RoundupEthereum Merge Vastly Increased Stakefish’s Profile, but 25% of Its Employees Are Gone Anyway: Layoffs at stakefish took effect on the same day as the Ethereum Merge – just as they were set to play a key role in securing the revamped blockchain.

The real was on track for its sharpest daily fall in five months.Crude oil and metal prices slid on worries about weaker demand. Mexico's currency fell 1.2% and Colombia's fell 1.7%. Top copper exporter Chile's peso marked its third straight week in the red.""Over the next couple of weeks, long-term investors may hesitate buying into weakness because it doesn't seem like any economic data release or Fed speak will convince markets that a downshift from this aggressive tightening campaign will be happening anytime soon,"" said Edward Moya, senior markets analyst, the Americas at Oanda.Latam currencies have fared better than broader emerging market peers as regional central banks started their hiking cycles early and went big, staying ahead of the Fed.Regional assets also benefited from the rise in commodity prices earlier this year. The Brazilian real has seen volatility in the run-up to elections in October, but is still up 6% for the year.""(Brazil's) fiscal revenues have consistently surprised on the upside over the past 12 months,"" said Elizabeth Johnson, managing director of Brazil research at TS Lombard.Story continues""The outlook for 2023 remains much more challenging, largely because of the massive increase in election-related government spending,"" she warned.Among stocks, Argentina's main index plunged 4.2%, while Colombia's COLCAP lost 3.4%. Brazil and Mexican indexes lost well more than 2% each.After a central bank heavy week, investors will be watching for more decisions next week, including from monetary authorities in Hungary, Mexico and Colombia, with all expected hike rates.In Colombia, analysts are split, with eight of the 17 analysts polled forecasting a 100 basis points hike, taking the key interest rate to 10%, while another eight expect a 150 bps rise.

You can see the Dow now below 30,000, looking at a five-day chart. Clearly, it has been a brutal week for the markets. Over the past five days, Dow now off just around 5%. On an intraday basis, the NASDAQ falling below 11,000, as we've seen a lot of these larger cap tech giants here getting hit, as we've seen rising rates.Obviously, the strong dollar here weighing on the broader markets. S&amp;P falling well below 3,700, now on track for 3,600. We had Goldman coming out today, lowering their year end target on the S&amp;P. So certainly some fear in the market action today. And really, we can say that about the market action for the week.Over the past five days, you can see the S&amp;P off just over 5 and 1/2%. I want to pull up the VIX. The fear gauge index certainly very important here to keep an eye on. Spiking above 30 here, really shows some of the fear out there in the market right now. Also the 10-year yield pulling back just a bit, now off just around 2 basis points at 3.69. It did top 3.8 earlier in the session today.Let's take a look at some of the sector action here because, again, we are seeing red across the board. Now, on an intraday basis, you're looking at energy off just over 7%, the XLE off 7%. Weakness in energy is a big story here in today's market. Consumer discretionary materials among the worst performers for the day.And then taking a look at the past five days, a very similar picture here. All 11 of the S&amp;P sectors in the red. Energy by far the laggard, off nearly 11%. Consumer discretionary, real estate here among the biggest laggards. Consumer staples, I guess you can say, it's the best performer of the bunch. It's still off, though, just around 3 and 1/2%.Story continuesAll right, let's get you up to speed on the currency action here, driving a lot of the losses that we're seeing play out in the equities markets. You have the strong dollar clearly a headwind here for the market. The dollar index once again moving higher today. Jared Blikre has a closer look at that for us. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey there. Well, let's take a look at our heat map, which has to do with the currencies. And all this green and dark green is the US dollar strengthening. This is a five-day price action. I'm just going to show you what happened today only. The British pound up 3.7%. This is an astounding move by cable here. By the way, this is inverted. Usually, we look at the currency cross upside down. But 25% over the last year means a lot of consternation.And I'm going to show you the max chart. Now we go back to the early 2000, but you can go all the way back to about the 1980s. We haven't seen a price here since the 1980s. We're talking about Margaret Thatcher. And what that means for all these currencies is more pain. And when we have these highly leveraged currencies, guess what? Institutions are forced to deleverage and sometimes sell their good holdings for bad holdings in order to raise cash for potential margin calls.So let's take a look. I just want to show you. I'm writing this up for the weekend. And I have a graphic here prepared here. We have the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira tied basically for the top spot, weakening against the dollar by about 40%. Then we have the krona over in Sweden and the yen. Now, these are two developed market currencies.And when you have this kind of action in foreign exchange in these markets, as I said, forced deleveraging could cause more pain. And we're seeing that play out this week, with the NASDAQ heading to the lowest price-- the Dow heading to the lowest price since November of 2020. All in all, not the best week for currencies, and much less, equities, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, thank you, Jared. Let's get over to Ines Ferre, who has a check on oil energy just absolutely crashing today. Hi there, Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, Dave, and crude closing out its fourth consecutive week of losses. Let's take a look at our YFi Interactive board. We're watching WTI, which closed below $80 a barrel at 78.74, its lowest close since early January. On a technical level, it could be heading towards $75. Then you're looking at brent crude, down more than 4 and 1/2%, closing just above $86 per barrel.Why the declines? Well, the strong US dollar that Jared was just talking about, worries of a recession as central banks raise interest rates, and China still has that zero COVID policy, a big concern for demand going forward. Looking at some other energy products, we're looking at gasoline futures, which today also declined by more than 5%, and also natural gas punching below $7. In fact, a 12-day chart, you can see that natural gas is down almost 17%, guys.]"

(NYSE:ZTS) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 33.6x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, Zoetis has been relatively sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Zoetis peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Zoetis will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Zoetis' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 10%. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 56% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the twelve analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 12% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.7% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Zoetis is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Zoetis' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  Zoetis is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than Zoetis.

The savings are the result of a federal production tax credit (PTC) for the development of solar energy centers, which FPL continues to build across Florida as part of the nation's largest solar expansion that today includes 50 operational sites.www.FPL.com . (PRNewsFoto/Florida Power &amp; Light Company)FPL solar energy centers that began serving customers in 2022 are retroactively eligible for the PTCs. To quickly provide these savings to customers, FPL is planning a one-time, $25 million refund in the month of January 2023. Also starting next year and through 2025, the company plans to phase in nearly $360 million in additional federal tax savings for future planned solar projects.""We recognize that all Floridians are continuing to deal with the challenges of record-high inflation and increased costs of everyday goods and services,"" said FPL Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy. ""As we continue working to operate even more efficiently to drive costs out of our business, federal tax savings will begin to provide some relief to customers next year as high natural gas prices continue to put upward pressure on bills.""FPL's 2022-2025 rate agreement, which was unanimously approved last year by state regulators and signed by the state's consumer advocate and other organizations, includes a provision that accounts for changes to federal tax law. This mechanism will facilitate the quick implementation of bill adjustments over the remainder of FPL's rate agreement.Story continuesDespite widespread support for the comprehensive rate agreement, which ensures FPL customers pay by far the lowest rates among utilities serving more than 75% of Floridians, some groups earlier this year appealed the Florida Public Service Commission's final order to the Florida Supreme Court.""Ironically, these self-proclaimed advocacy groups are now effectively asking Florida's highest court to tear up the very rate agreement that will soon quickly enable customers to begin saving hundreds of millions of dollars on their electric bills over the next three years, including a multi-million-dollar lump sum refund to start the new year,"" Silagy said.2023 BillsAs a result of federal tax savings, FPL projects its typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill to be $126.65 in January 2023, by far the lowest among Florida's investor-owned utilities, which serve more than 75% of the state. The company projects its typical 1,000-kWh residential customer bill in Northwest Florida, which includes a temporary hurricane surcharge for past Northwest Florida storms, to be $156.85. All bills would increase slightly in February in the absence of the one-time refund due to an approved base rate adjustment and higher expected fuel costs in 2023, but still reflect lower base rates as a result of federal tax savings.FPLNorthwest FloridaOriginal January 2023 Estimate →New January 2023 Estimate→February2023 EstimateOriginal January 2023 Estimate→New January 2023 Estimate→February 2023 Estimate$130.23$126.65$129.59$160.43$156.85$159.81Note: Rates include a regulatory assessment fee and gross receipts tax but do not include utility taxes and/or franchise fees, which vary by area.Note: Rates include temporary hurricane surcharge as well as a regulatory assessment fee and gross receipts tax, but do not include utility taxes and/or franchise fees, which vary by area.FPL's 2023 bill projections do not include higher-than-projected fuel costs in 2022, which the company has paid but are not yet reflected in bills. FPL does not profit from the fuel it purchases to generate electricity at power plants; it passes those costs directly to customers. The company continues to monitor the still highly volatile fuel market to get a more accurate assessment of actual costs for 2022, with the goal of easing the impact for customers. FPL expects to file a mid-course fuel correction by the end of this year or early next year, which will result in an additional adjustment to rates in 2023.Driving down costs while supporting customersWhile natural gas prices have increased sharply and the fuel market remains volatile, FPL continues to improve the fuel efficiency of its power plants and invest in low-cost renewable energy that is reducing the fuel portion of customer bills. Since 2001, the modernization of FPL's power plant fleet has saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel the company did not need to buy, which equates to approximately $4.50 per month, or $55 per year, on the typical 1,000-kWh FPL residential customer bill. In fact, FPL's 50 solar energy centers helped customers avoid more than $200 million in fuel costs in just the first seven months of 2022 alone – which equates to roughly $3 per month on the typical 1,000-kWh FPL residential customer bill.FPL is committed to reducing and eventually eliminating the fuel portion of customer bills, but it will take time. As natural gas costs are increasingly expensive, unstable and hard to predict, the company is working to reduce and, by no later than 2045, eliminate natural gas from regular operations – and the fuel portion of customer bills along with it.FPL has long been committed to helping customers find new ways to reduce their energy use, which is the best way to save on electric bills.

Customers struggling to pay their bill can call FPL's dedicated customer service team who can work with them to identify payment arrangements and available assistance at the local, state and federal level.Florida Power &amp; Light CompanyAs America's largest electric utility, Florida Power &amp; Light Company serves more customers and sells more power than any other utility, providing clean, affordable, reliable electricity to approximately 5.8 million accounts, or more than 12 million people.

Expectations were set for design win announcements during CES 2023.Also, many other opportunities would likely be closed within the next two years.The Qualcomm bears may point to these wins as lower-level processing and not the domain processor, but he liked the progression of lower-end CPU designs to higher end in the long-term wins strategy.Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis reiterated Equal Weight and a $160 price target.Curtis found it well-positioned within next-gen Auto designs with a stronghold in connectivity, growth in the digital cockpit, and emerging presence in ADAS/AD.Though Auto is a strong growth driver over the next decade+, the story is still heavily levered to Mobile, where NT Android trends are weaker and likely result in estimate revisions.Wells Fargo reiterated an Equal Weight and $150 price target.It highlighted how Qualcomm focused on the Snapdragon Digital Chassis enabling transformation in the automobile.While Qualcomm's automotive revenues represent only $1.3 billion, or ~3%, of total revenues today, it saw a significant opportunity to grow automotive revenues driven by accelerating trends within automotive.The analyst found it difficult for QCOM shares to outperform peers based on constrained LT growth prospects specific to the mature mobile handset market, which still drives ~60% of QCT sales.Price Action: QCOM shares traded lower by 2.36% at $120.75 on the last check Friday.Photo Via CompanyStory continuesLatest Ratings for QCOMDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022MizuhoMaintainsBuyFeb 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightFeb 2022JP MorganMaintainsOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for QCOMView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaApple Resolves iPhone 14 Pro Camera Glitch, As PromisedRenault Claims To Accomplish EV Goals Well In AdvanceA 2014 Tesla Has Surpassed 1 Million Miles Driven, But One Component Had To Be Replaced 8 Times - Tesla (Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Qualcomm is revving up its partnerships announcing a deal with Mercedes-Benz for its upcoming vehicles at its automotive investor day. The chipmaker also announced the expansion of its automotive design win pipeline to $30 billion. Joining us now to discuss, Qualcomm automotive senior vice president and general manager, Nakul Duggal.Thank you so much, Nakul, for being here. Looks like investors when you guys made this announcement yesterday were pretty pleased with the results. This was a bigger than expected pipeline than they were looking for. So talk to me about the process here. I know that-- what-- automotive is about 12% of your sales or so right now. What are you guys pushing towards here in terms of goals?NAKUL DUGGAL: Good morning. Thank you for having me. Look, we had a fantastic investor day. The auto industry is betting on the Qualcomm Snapdragon digital chassis platform, which we are working with a large number of automakers on. As the industry goes through this massive transformation that is upon them, every car company has to very rapidly become a technology company.And Qualcomm is being selected by a variety of different automakers globally as that technology partner of choice. We expect rapid transition in terms of how the market evolves when it comes to automated driving, digital cockpits, connectivity. So the definition of the new car of the future is going to require this shift in technology adoption. And that's what we are driving.- Is that total addressable market based on clients, customers, partners that you're already working with? Or is that also in competition where you're going to seek to take on a certain extent of the market share of that total addressable market? And if you can kind of parse through some of your competitors that are also going to be really competing for that, how that really looks like and how ready you are to accelerate that, too.Story continuesNAKUL DUGGAL: So we have been consistently and patiently investing in this space. There are a few things that are absolutely evolving. One is the silicon and the software content is rapidly expanding in vehicles as every vehicle starts to become software defined. That is certainly a big accelerant in terms of the addressable market. I think the other big shift that is happening is that automakers are making direct bets on technology partners that they want to be able to work with over multiple generations.So sitting here today in '22, we are involved in decisions for production years '26 and beyond. And this is why we are actually able to provide visibility in terms of what the business starts to look like over the rest of this decade because the pipeline that we announced is actually providing us that coverage over an extended period of time. And we've shared the $30 billion number, but we are essentially seeing a rapid transition in the market in terms of making these technology bets. And that's how we are able to forecast that larger addressable market.- Nakul, I want to ask about supply chain for a moment here. Now, I know you guys aren't fab. You're designers and licensors. But nonetheless, you're affected by what's going on in supply chain. We're hearing from the likes of Ford that they've got 40,000 or 45,000 unfinished vehicles sitting around. Is any of that because-- or not Ford specifically, but are we seeing still issues with getting automotive chips into vehicles?NAKUL DUGGAL: That's a good question. One thing that Qualcomm did early on right at the beginning of the pandemic was we prioritized automotive supply above all other verticals that we're involved in. So we wanted to make sure that none of our customers were impacted by the supply chain crisis on account of anything that Qualcomm would ship. Now, obviously, automakers put in a variety of different semiconductors that have a various set of dependencies across a fairly complex supply chain. We do see that the supply chain complexity is going to improve over the second half of next year. We ourselves are not necessarily seeing any specific challenges on the products that we supply [INAUDIBLE]- Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm automotive senior vice president and general manager and owner of a birds of paradise and monstera plant behind you there. Appreciate it.NAKUL DUGGAL: Thank you for having me.]"

This reflects the current estimated value of future orders within the automotive business as it aims to connect millions of devices to the ‘connected intelligent edge’.Driven by increasing adoption of Snapdragon Digital Chassis solutions across the auto industry, the design win portfolio has improved by more than $10 billion from third-quarter fiscal 2022 tally. Qualcomm is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking that helps to transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets. The automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit, and C-V2X solutions are fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification.The buyout of Veoneer, Inc. offers Qualcomm a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology, as it aims to extend the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) portfolio. The Arriver business of Veoneer operates the dedicated software unit focused on sensor perception and drive policy, including a full stack of features and functions. It was born out of a collaborative agreement with Qualcomm and leveraged the chipmaker’s Snapdragon Ride SoC hardware to emerge as a leading ADAS solution provider in the auto industry.With the acquisition, Qualcomm has incorporated Arriver's Computer Vision, Drive Policy and Driver Assistance assets into its ADAS portfolio to deliver an open and competitive platform for automakers to better compete with rivals within the self-driving vehicle market. This, in turn, is likely to augment its automotive business as it strives to boost revenues beyond chipmaking for the smartphone market.The company intends to harness artificial intelligence to meet increased demands for essential products and services that are the building blocks for digital transformation in the cloud economy. Qualcomm also envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by its Snapdragon portfolio, which has reportedly set high standards for premium-tier Android handsets.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches. It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to superfast 5G networks, delivering low-power resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and Qualcomm's best-in-class security. This, in turn, would further offer the flexibility and scalability needed for broad and fast 5G adoption through accelerated commercialization by OEMs.Qualcomm is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning both sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the largest RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. The company believes that it is on track to become the largest smartphone RF front-end supplier by revenues in the near future.Shares of the company have lost 7.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 14.8%.

The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, FL.Details of the DealValued at $985.3 million, the contract is projected to be completed by March 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide system design and develop the HACM weapon through model-based critical design review, qualification, integration, manufacturing and testing.Work related to this deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ.How Will the Deal Favor Raytheon?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and Raytheon being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations offers the company solid growth opportunities.Notably, HACM is a first-of-its-kind weapon developed in conjunction with the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE), a U.S. and Australia project arrangement. HACM, with the help of Scramjet engines, is able to reach targets more quickly than traditional missiles, allowing it to potentially evade defensive systems. No doubt, such an advanced weapon will bolster Raytheon’s position in the U.S. defense space, thereby boosting the company’s top line in the coming quarters.Looking AheadPer a report by the Allied Market Research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2022-2031 period to reach $82 million by 2031.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has provided the award.Details of the DealValued at $20.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms, Boeing will offer logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, support equipment maintenance, and engineering services to support the P-8A aircraft.The contract will cater to the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Jacksonville, FL, Whidbey Island, WA and Sigonella, Italy.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing,  one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing,  the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 20.8% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

""Fiona caused some water in a couple of our facilities but we have them under control. And we do not have any major equipment issues. Everything is up and running.""Medtronic is reaching out to all employees to make sure they're safe and supported. The company has already reached 98 percent of employees and continues to work to contact the rest. Two thirds of employees made it to work for the first shift on Tuesday and more arrived Wednesday. Those who couldn't are dealing with emergencies at home, such as no power or water. ""We're doing everything we can to help them,"" Rodriguez said.Schools are closed throughout the island and that's also causing daycare issues for working parents.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.02bUS$6.15bUS$5.72bUS$6.62bUS$7.15bUS$7.49bUS$7.79bUS$8.06bUS$8.29bUS$8.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.85%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$4.7kUS$5.0kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.0%– 1.9%) = US$171bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$171b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$136b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$83.6, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

108,cd97b7a1-cfeb-3a04-88f9-b933a5221750,CCI,2022-09-24,Is Crown Castle Inc.'s (NYSE:CCI) ROE Of 20% Impressive?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-inc-nyse-cci-140049946.html,1663941649,STORY,['CCI'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Crown Castle How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Crown Castle is:20% = US$1.5b ÷ US$7.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.20.Does Crown Castle Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Crown Castle has a higher ROE than the average (6.6%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Crown Castle by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCrown Castle's Debt And Its 20% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Crown Castle, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.68. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this  free list of interesting companies.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

109,a5cb2e57-0d3d-3563-84e0-04854d344869,MRK,2022-09-24,Merck (NYSE:MRK) shareholders have earned a 11% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-nyse-mrk-shareholders-earned-110017970.html,1664017217,STORY,['MRK'],"[If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) share price is up 36% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. However, if you include the dividends then the return is market beating. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 18%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Merck To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Merck managed to grow its earnings per share at 29% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 6% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Merck has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Merck the TSR over the last 5 years was 66%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Merck shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times.

Sitagliptin is the active ingredient in Merck’s diabetes medicines, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR.Viatris is looking for FDA approval for its generic versions of Januvia and Janumet in the United States.The lawsuit involves two patents, one (7,326,708) covering the phosphate salt of sitagliptin and the other (8,414,921) covering the co-formulation of sitagliptin and metformin found in Janumet. While the phosphate salt patent is set to expire on Nov 24, 2026, the co-formulation patent will expire on Jan 21, 2029. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia ruled in Merck’s favor by saying that Viatris infringed on these patents.Merck’s stock has risen 14.2% this year so far against a decrease of 6.5% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier, the U.S. Patent Office issued a ruling in Merck’s favor in 2021 in an Inter Parties Review filed by Viatris challenging sitagliptin’s salt patent. Viatris has filed an appeal in the Court of AppealsSeparately, Merck has signed settlement agreements with multiple generic companies to allow them to launch their generic version of Januvia/Janumet in May 2026 or earlier under some circumstances.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) recorded sales of $1.23 billion in the second quarter of 2022, rising 3%, excluding the impact of currency. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and are set to lose market exclusivity in the European Union in September. This may lead to generic entry hurting international sales significantly. However, the patent win in the United States may delay the generic entry in the country for a while now.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMerck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Morphic MORF and Agenus AGEN, both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

The FDA approved expanded use of Eli Lilly’s LLY cancer drug Retevmo for multiple tumor types and allowed Merck MRK to resume a phase III program on HIV candidate islatravir with a lower dose. GSK GSK signed an exclusive license agreement with Spero Therapeutics for its investigational antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRoche’s Eye Injection, Vabysmo Gets Approval in Europe: The EC granted approval to Roche’s injectable eye medicine, Vabysmo (faricimab) for treating two leading causes of vision loss worldwide — neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). The approval was based on data from four phase III studies in nAMD and DME. Vabysmo was approved by the FDA for nAMD and DME in January.EU Approves AstraZeneca’s Tezspire: The EC also approved AstraZeneca’s monoclonal antibody, Tezspire (tezepelumab), for the treatment of severe asthma. Tezspire was approved in the United States for a similar indication in December 2021. AstraZeneca markets Tezspire in partnership with Amgen. The approval of Tezspire was based on data from the PATHFINDER clinical program and included the pivotal phase III NAVIGATOR study. Data from these studies showed that treatment with Tezspire led to superior results across every primary and key secondary endpoint in patients with severe asthma, compared to placebo, when added to standard therapy.The EC also granted marketing approval to AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail medicine, Evusheld in the European Union for the treatment of COVID-19. The recommendation was based on TACKLE phase III treatment data, which showed a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 or death on treatment with one intramuscular dose of Evusheld.Story continuesEvusheld was until now authorized for the prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis) of COVID-19 in certain high-risk populations in Europe as well as the United States and some other countries. The medicine was not authorized for treating COVID-19. Evusheld is now the only long-acting antibody combination available for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in Europe.FDA Approves Lilly’s Retevmo for Multiple RET-Driven Tumor Types: The FDA approved Lilly’s cancer drug Retevmo for expanded use in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion. Until now, Retevmo was approved for patients with advanced RET-driven lung and thyroid cancers. The latest approval of the tumor-agnostic indication expands Retevmo’s patient base to include several tumor types. The approval is based on positive data from the pivotal phase I/II LIBRETTO-001 study, which evaluated selpercatinib across a variety of tumor types in patients with RET-driven cancers. In the study, Retevmo demonstrated an overall response rate of 44% across multiple tumor types.Simultaneously, the FDA converted the accelerated approval granted to Retevmo in non-small cell lung cancer indication in May 2020 to a full approval.FDA Allows Merck to Resume Islatravir HIV Studies with Lower Dose: Merck announced that it will evaluate a lower dose of its HIV candidate islatravir in a phase III program several months after the FDA put studies on the candidate on hold last year. While six studies on islatravir were placed on full clinical hold, seven were put on partial clinical hold. Now the new phase III studies will evaluate a once-daily oral combination of doravirine 100 mg and a lower dose of islatravir (DOR/ISL). Merck will also resume a phase II study evaluating the combination of a once-weekly treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead’s lenacapavir. Even this study will use a lower dose of islatravir. However, Merck has decided to discontinue the development of once-monthly oral islatravirfor theprevention of HIV infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. The FDA has agreed to Merck’s plan.GSK Buys Exclusive Rights to Spero’s Novel Oral Antibiotic: GSK is in-licensing exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Spero Therapeutics’ late-stage oral antibiotic candidate, tebipenem HBr for the potential treatment of cUTI. If approved by the FDA, tebipenem HBr will become the first oral treatment for cUTI, providing patients a novel alternative to in-hospital intravenous therapyFor the acquisition, Glaxo will make an upfront payment of $66 million to Spero, while the latter will also be entitled to future milestone payments and tiered royalties. In addition, Glaxo will invest $9 million in shares of Spero.

Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$719k which is not ideal.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$131. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 5.48k shares worth US$1.1m. But they sold 990.00 shares for US$220k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Boeing insiders. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Boeing insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$55m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders do have a stake in Boeing and their transactions don't cause us concern. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, FL.Details of the DealValued at $985.3 million, the contract is projected to be completed by March 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide system design and develop the HACM weapon through model-based critical design review, qualification, integration, manufacturing and testing.Work related to this deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ.How Will the Deal Favor Raytheon?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and Raytheon being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations offers the company solid growth opportunities.Notably, HACM is a first-of-its-kind weapon developed in conjunction with the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE), a U.S. and Australia project arrangement. HACM, with the help of Scramjet engines, is able to reach targets more quickly than traditional missiles, allowing it to potentially evade defensive systems. No doubt, such an advanced weapon will bolster Raytheon’s position in the U.S. defense space, thereby boosting the company’s top line in the coming quarters.Looking AheadPer a report by the Allied Market Research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2022-2031 period to reach $82 million by 2031. Such massive growth projections indicate solid opportunities for Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Boeing BA, which specialize in developing technologically advanced missiles.Story continuesLockheed Martin’s missile defense program includes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs. It also manufactures the Multiple Launch Rocket System, Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Javelin tactical missile programs alongside other tactical missiles.Lockheed boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 64.46%. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%.Likewise, Boeing’s Integrated Air &amp; Missile Defense portfolio includes Arrow 3, which offers regional missile defense capabilities to enable an effective response to short and medium-range ballistic missiles.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2022 sales suggests an improvement of 14.8% from the 2021 reported figure. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.Similarly, Northrop Grumman’s missile defense program includes AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation guided missiles, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system and rocket propulsion systems.Northrop boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.92%.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has provided the award.Details of the DealValued at $20.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms, Boeing will offer logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, support equipment maintenance, and engineering services to support the P-8A aircraft.The contract will cater to the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Jacksonville, FL, Whidbey Island, WA and Sigonella, Italy.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing,  one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing,  the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 20.8% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

CGP is a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach that uses a single test to assess hundreds of genes-including relevant cancer biomarkers, as established in medical guidelines and clinical trials-for tumor therapy guidance.During an invitation-only roundtable at the conference, Illumina Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Phil Febbo said: ""I do believe that having a complete understanding of an individual's cancer is the best way to provide best care for patients. It's amazing to be in this role and at a company that's really driving to make this available and accessible."" Four panelists at the roundtable discussed the value of CGP in case studies relating to prostate cancer, liquid biopsy, and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) detection and diagnostics.In addition to these case studies, the doctors talked about their methods of using CGP in their practice, their distinction between testing tissue versus liquid, the challenges of attracting talent to the lab, the business of collecting and interpreting data, and the need to improve care and-most importantly-outcomes.Dr. Nicole Pfarr, head of both the Molecular Diagnostic Unit and the Next Generation Research Facility at the Technical University of Munich, spoke about a drive to build collective knowledge: German universities and hospitals are compiling genetic data to establish a national database. With that in mind, more testing will mean more data. ""We want to include more in the Molecular Tumor Board discussions,"" she said. ""It used to be that we would do a large gene panel and if we found something, then we would do HRD [testing]. Now we do all the testing up front. Large gene panel, HRD, translocations included. We do this for all the ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic and prostate cancer. And, astonishingly, we also find high HRD scores in sarcomas.""Story continuesWhile testing and generating data has been critical to developing the field of precision oncology, the data itself carries great significance from a patient perspective. ""I've had some interesting discussions about the return of data,"" said Dr. Bettina Ryll, founder of the Melanoma Patient Network Europe and former EU Cancer Mission Board member. ""Some patients want the data. They can't always tell you why or what they're precisely going to do with it, but being in possession of one's own data-in particular genomic data-returns some ownership of the disease and might help to cope. This ownership gives back some of the control you have lost in the cancer diagnosis, and we should not underestimate the psychological value of that. I have medical training, I have a science background, and I can tell you, when my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma I realized how much I had no clue how it is to go through it. I had always considered cancer a medical issue, but if you're there personally you see the psychological issue is half the problem-and it hits the patient, the carers, the people who are there, and it's huge.""Ryll, who lives in Sweden, also urges the medical community to support greater genomic literacy among patients. ""I preach a lot about the difference between somatic and germline,"" she said. ""One of the first questions I always get is ‘Is it possible I have passed this on to my children?' People are very worried and experience huge feelings of guilt. We have a responsibility toward our patients to lessen their burden and make an effort to teach and contribute to the general education.""Dr. Joaquin Mateo, an oncologist and research leader at Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, also emphasized the patient experience: ""One of the problems is that the infrastructure for precision medicine has been set up from hospitals based on the particularities of the hospital, not the particularities of the patient. They may have to travel, for example, or sometimes their data will need to be accessible from afar to be assessed by other professionals. We need to prepare easy pathways for patients who may need to receive testing, counseling, and treatment in different places."" He stressed the need to put the patient at the center and organize the rest of the infrastructure around them.""Melanoma is obviously close to my heart,"" said Ryll, whose husband was diagnosed with it in 2011 and died a year later. ""At the time we had a survival of 5% for five years, now we are at 50%. It sounds great, but it means we still lose one out of two patients. For us, precision medicine is one of those fields that offers a lot of hope.""Learn more about Illumina here.Illumina, Friday, September 23, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717270/How-Comprehensive-Genomic-Profiling-Is-Helping-Cancer-Patients-Today]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+2.6% vs. -2.1%). UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%.The uptick in overall volumes as labor woes ease is an added positive. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management expects share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels.However, escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in the operating expenses during first-half 2022. Fuel costs surged 82% in the period. Fuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AT&amp;T’s shares have declined -41.7% over the past year against Verizon's -27.8% decline and -16.8% pullback in the S&amp;P 500 index. The company is struggling with a steady decline in its legacy telephony Internet and wireline services. High-speed Internet revenues are also contracting due to a decline in the legacy digital subscriber line. With the divesture of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T must build upon its core businesses to improve its value proposition as spectrum crisis and cord-cutting remain challenges.However, AT&amp;T is witnessing solid subscriber momentum. A customer-centric business model, is providing the company with healthy growth in its postpaid wireless business alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans.The company is actively investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjusting its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth. While optimizing operations, it is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Blackstone’s shares have declined -33.3% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -27.2%. The company’s elevated operating expenses are expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the near term. Our estimates for total expenses (GAAP) suggest a CAGR of almost 17% over the next three years.Additionally, lower chance of sustainability of its capital deployment activities (given the volatile nature of its earnings) remains another major near-term concern and hence makes us apprehensive. However, Blackstone remains well-poised to benefit from its strong fund-raising ability, revenue mix and global footprint.The buyout of DCI is expected to further enhance its digital capabilities. Additionally, continued net inflows are expected to support Blackstone's assets under management (AUM) growth, going forward.

A highly leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Pioneer Natural (PXD) Banks On Oil-Rich Permian Basin AssetsThe Zacks analyst believes that Pioneer Natural's one-million-plus high-quality acreages in the Permian Basin will drive long-term oil production growth. Yet, rising production costs are concerning.Improving Fees and Commissions Aid Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG)Per the Zacks analyst, Arthur J.

However, rising expenses weighing on margin concerns.Competitor's Product Recall Aids ResMed (RMD), Mask Sales UpThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about a voluntary recall of CPAP and ventilator devices by ResMed's competitor leading to a demand shift toward ResMed products. Mask sales climb on patient flow recovery.Expansion Efforts to Aid Restaurant Brands (QSR), Costs HighPer the Zacks analyst, Restaurant Brands is likely to benefit from unit expansion efforts, menu innovation and loyalty program. However, a rise in labor and commodity costs is a concern.New UpgradesCadence (CDNS) Benefits from Product Portfolio &amp; AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, Cadence's performance is gaining from robust demand for the company's diversified product portfolio.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Comptroller, Ann Daiss, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$506k worth of shares at a price of US$67.47 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$75.94, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 29% of Ann Daiss's stake.Southern insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$191m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Southern Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Southern shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Southern, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Southern. For example - Southern has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusBased in Germantown, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -30.78%. The real estate investment trust is paying out a dividend of $1.25 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.15% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.01% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5 is up 22% from last year. Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 4.22%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Mid-America Apartment Communities's current payout ratio is 57%, meaning it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MAA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.28 per share, with earnings expected to increase 18.12% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MAA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Armament Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, FL.Details of the DealValued at $985.3 million, the contract is projected to be completed by March 2027. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide system design and develop the HACM weapon through model-based critical design review, qualification, integration, manufacturing and testing.Work related to this deal will be executed in Tucson, AZ.How Will the Deal Favor Raytheon?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and Raytheon being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations offers the company solid growth opportunities.Notably, HACM is a first-of-its-kind weapon developed in conjunction with the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE), a U.S. and Australia project arrangement. HACM, with the help of Scramjet engines, is able to reach targets more quickly than traditional missiles, allowing it to potentially evade defensive systems. No doubt, such an advanced weapon will bolster Raytheon’s position in the U.S. defense space, thereby boosting the company’s top line in the coming quarters.Looking AheadPer a report by the Allied Market Research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2022-2031 period to reach $82 million by 2031.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has provided the award.Details of the DealValued at $20.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms, Boeing will offer logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, support equipment maintenance, and engineering services to support the P-8A aircraft.The contract will cater to the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Jacksonville, FL, Whidbey Island, WA and Sigonella, Italy.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing,  one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing,  the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 20.8% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 37.4% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 34.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:NKE) as one of its primary recommendations.The sport apparel giant's year-to-date trajectory has been far from ideal, but its economic performance remains robust, potentially leaving its stock in oversold territory.Based on a holistic analysis, I believe Nike is a high-quality stock, but by no means a dividend play.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Is Nike a Top Dividend Pick?Earnings review and previewNike's operating results have remained resilient throughout the year despite various global macroeconomic headwinds. The company delivered a solid second-quarter earnings report, trumping earnings expectations by 9 cents per share.During its latest financial quarter, the company's NIKE DIRECT surged by 11% year over year on a currency-neutral basis, assumingly stemming from enhanced digitalization and consumer targeting. Additionally, the company resumed its $15 billion share buyback program, repurchasing $1.1 billion worth of stock.Nike is due to release its third-quarter results on Sept. 29th, and many analysts are optimistic about the company's report.According to Piral Dadhania of RBC Capital Market, Nike is likely to record revenue growth from China despite numerous Covid-19 lockdowns. He also believes the company's profit margins could improve due to high-level operating leverage.Lastly, from a quantitative vantage point, Nike's income statement has been subject to conservative earnings recognition. For example, the Beneish M-Score of -2.30 means the company has recognized earnings conservatively and any accounting-driven earnings surprise will likely be to the upside.Is Nike a Top Dividend Pick?Valuation and dividendEven though Nike's earnings prospects seem bright, its stock is not attractively valued. Both relative and absolute valuation metrics suggest it is overvalued.Story continuesAccording to GuruFocus' discounted cash flow analysis, Nike's stock has a fair value of $51.59, which is well below its traded price of $96.83. In addition, the company has a price-earnings ratio of 25.15, accommodated by a PEG ratio of 2.96, indicating the market overhypes its earnings per share potential.Is Nike a Top Dividend Pick?Nike's 1.28% dividend yield is not bad by any means, but it is certainly nowhere near the best on the market. The company presents a balanced shareholder compensation package, with share buybacks forming a significant part of its residual distribution. Moreover, Nike is reinvesting heavily to expand its footprint in emerging markets; therefore, it is unlikely that the stock will be a dividend pure-play anytime soon.Is Nike a Top Dividend Pick?Concluding thoughtsMorgan Stanley's classification of Nike as a top dividend pick is questionable. There is no doubt that it is a high-quality company with operational finesse. However, key metrics suggest it is not a dividend pure play.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Avenatti is appealing the conviction and sentence.Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 from Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for keeping quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with the future U.S. president, which he denied.Avenatti successfully freed Daniels from a non-disclosure agreement with Trump, paving the way for her 2018 memoir ""Full Disclosure,"" where she described the alleged liaison.Lawyers for Avenatti and Daniels did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Before the trial, Avenatti had already been serving a 2-1/2 year sentence after being convicted in 2020 of trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike Inc.Avenatti was also ordered to pay $259,800.50 in restitution to Nike, but the athletic wear company agreed that his individual victims could get paid first.Parts of the prison sentences run concurrently, and Avenatti is expected to serve a total of five years behind bars.He also faces a scheduled Nov. 7 sentencing in California after pleading guilty in June to five federal charges there, including four counts of wire fraud for defrauding clients.

In Q4, Nike beat expectations for earnings and revenues, and reported a net income down 5% to $1.4 billion, or 91 cents per share.More from Footwear NewsA Jarritos x Nike SB Dunk Collab Is Reportedly Releasing Next YearBella Hadid Transitions Into Fall in A Tan Suede Skirt &amp; Patent Leather Boots with Her Boyfriend Marc KalmanSerena Williams Is Officially a 'Soccer Mom' in Fitted Tank Top &amp; Hot Pink Nike Hat at Daughter Olympia's First GameNike is still widely considered the company to beat in the athletic market. But like other global brands, Nike has recently faced significant headwinds related to factory and store shutdowns in China and Vietnam, supply chain slowdowns and port congestion in the U.S. According to analysts, these issues will likely weigh on the company’s first quarter results next week.Williams Trading Analyst Sam Poser noted that while sales and shipments of the company’s Jordan brand and Air Force 1 product have improved, overall visibility is still murky.“Trends in China remain uncertain due to ongoing pandemic-related lockdowns, foreign exchange headwinds are worsening, and a shipment bottleneck is likely as late shipments and current shipments arrive at the same time,” Poser wrote in a Sept. 20 note to clients in which he gave Nike a “Hold” rating.Given these headwinds, Poser said it is possible that Nike will need to implement a more robust promotional strategy through the year, though it is unclear if Nike will need to shift its wholesale distribution strategy.In his preview for Nike’s earnings, Cowen analyst John Kernan also noted that China “remains a major swing factor” for Nike’s potential results in Q1. However, the analyst said he expects China to return to growth in Q2 and added that “Nike continues to significantly outperform Adidas globally from an execution standpoint.”Story continuesAnalysts from Jane Hali &amp; Associates (JHA) LLC also mentioned potential headwinds in China, but added that Nike’s performance in EMEA and North America could offset the losses. Overall, JHA said it was “Neutral” on Nike for Q1, though optimistic about its long-term potential.“Nike is one of the most modern brands across its product and retail strategy,” JHA said in a note to clients. “The brand puts the consumer at the center of its evolution and uses data-driven insights to create a localized approach that reaches consumers across the globe.”Morgan Stanley analysts in a Wednesday note to clients also noted Nike’s long-term potential, despite a rough macroeconomic environment, supply chain issues, problems in Greater China and a potential recession threat.“While the long-term opportunity remains compelling, macroeconomic deterioration and limited visibility makes current discounted valuation fair, in our view,” the note read. “And until visibility improves, we see more attractive opportunities elsewhere in our coverage.”]"

NKE is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Sep 29. The leading sports apparel retailer is likely to have witnessed top-line growth in the fiscal first quarter, while earnings per share are expected to have declined year over year. The company continues to gain from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, along with strong demand, compelling products, and robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses. Supply-chain constraints, continued weakness in Greater China and higher costs have been weighing on its performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $12.3 billion, suggesting 0.7% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 19.8% from the year-ago reported number. Earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter have been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s fiscal first-quarter total revenues to increase 1.2% year over year to $12,397.4 million and the bottom line to decline 22.2% to 90 cents per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 11.1%. Its bottom line beat the consensus estimate by 16.4%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNIKE, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNIKE is expected to have witnessed continued strong demand for its products, robust performance in its digital and DTC businesses, and product innovation in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy are also expected to have been tailwinds.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company stated that it remains confident of its performance in first-quarter fiscal 2023, driven by brand strength, consumer connections, product pipeline and normalizing of inventory supply in North America, EMEA and APLA. For first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company predicted real dollar revenue growth to be flat to up slightly.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and strength in NIKE Digital, courtesy of strong demand across its app ecosystem. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic and higher conversion rates. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management noted that traffic trends began to move toward the pre-pandemic levels.Additionally, improved NIKE Direct margins, driven by lower markdowns and higher full-price sales mix, have been aiding the gross margin, even though the headwinds related to escalated freight and logistic costs have persisted.However, NIKE’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues are likely to have been impacted by weakness in Greater China due to the COVID-19 wave and rising costs to support brand and digital investments. The company has been witnessing soft revenues in China for the past few quarters, owing to the resurgence of COVID-19 and the ongoing supply-chain disruptions. On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management remained cautious about its performance in Greater China due to the uncertainty around additional COVID-19 disruptions.We expect fiscal first-quarter revenues for the Greater China region to decline 17.8% year over year to $1,628 million.NKE has been witnessing a decline in gross margin due to higher inventory obsolescence reserves in Greater China and increased freight and logistics costs. On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted more than a 100-bps decline in the gross margin for the fiscal first quarter, owing to efforts to streamline supply and demand in Greater China. Moreover, increased higher promotional activity to sell seasonal inventory, which arrived late due to a combination of factory closures and longer transit times, is likely to hurt the gross margin.The return of sports activities and events has been leading to elevated selling and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for NKE, driven by an increase in operating overhead and demand-creating expenses. Increased sports marketing expenses and sustained investments in digital marketing to support elevated digital demand have been resulting in higher demand creating expense. Further, higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation, have been causing increased operating overhead costs.We expect the gross margin for the fiscal first quarter to decline 100 bps to 45.5%, which is in sync with the company’s forecast. Our estimate indicates a 10.1% year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expense for the fiscal first quarter, with the SG&amp;A expense rate increasing 250 bps. Operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, as a percentage of sales, are expected to increase 180 bps and 70 bps, respectively, in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

GSK will have the right to market the drug in all territories except Japan and certain other Asian countries. While Spero will be responsible for the follow-up late-stage study evaluating tebipenem HBr, GSK will be responsible for additional clinical development on the candidate and bear the costs for regulatory submissions and commercialization activities. In addition, GSK will also invest $9 million in Spero’s common stock. However, GSK will not hold more than a 20% equity stake in SPRO.Spero does not have any marketed drugs in its portfolio. A partnership with a pharma giant like GSK, which has huge cash resources and industry expertise and a global commercial presence, will help SPRO fund its other pipeline candidates currently undergoing clinical development. Following the deal with GSK, Spero expects that its current cash runway will be sufficient to fund its operations beyond 2024.Spero will also be eligible to receive potential milestone payments from GSK. The company will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales if the candidate is approved.In the year so far, shares of Spero Therapeutics have plunged 86.3% compared with the industry’s 26.8% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn June, Spero received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for an NDA seeking approval for tebipenem HBr to treat adult patients with certain bacterial microorganisms that cause cUTI, including pyelonephritis. In the CRL, the regulatory body concluded that the data from the phase III ADAPT-PO study was insufficient to support approval during the prior review cycle.Story continuesThis month, Spero announced that it achieved common ground with the FDA on the regulatory path forward for tebipenem HBr in cUTI. The regulatory body indicated that positive results from a single additional phase III study, supported by confirmatory nonclinical evidence of efficacy, could be sufficient to back the approval of tebipenem HBr for treating cUTI, including pyelonephritis for a limited use indication.SPRO also reached alignment with the FDA on key components of the proposed pivotal phase III study design. Management intends to start this study next year.The successful development of the candidate will be a significant boost for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company like SPRO. If approved, tebipenem HBr will be the first oral carbapenem antibiotic in the United States.The meeting was also conducted to discuss the steps required to resubmit the new drug application (NDA) for tebipenem HBr to treat cUTI, including pyelonephritis.While tebipenem HBr is Spero’s most advanced pipeline candidate, the company is also evaluating other pipeline candidates. SPRO is also developing SPR720 as a novel oral therapy product candidate for treating a rare, orphan pulmonary disease caused by non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections.The company has an IV-administered next-generation polymyxin product candidate, SPR206, in its pipeline being developed to treat multi-drug resistant Gram-negative infections in the hospital setting.The development of SPR206 is supported by funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Spero also has a license agreement with Pfizer PFE for the same.Pfizer previously announced a $40-million equity investment in Spero. Per the terms, Pfizer has the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206 in ex-U.S. and ex-Asia territories. In lieu, Spero is eligible to receive up to $80 million in development and sales milestone payments and high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of SPR206 in these territories.In July, SPRO achieved a regulatory milestone under its license agreement with Pfizer, which will earn it a $5-million milestone payment expected in the third quarter of 2022.Spero Therapeutics, Inc.

143,bb0937eb-010b-387c-bdd2-7d61f6c428bb,PFE,2022-09-24,Why Novavax (NVAX) Stock Was Down 13% on Thursday,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-novavax-nvax-stock-down-145102519.html,1663944662,STORY,"['NVAX', 'BNTX', 'MRNA', 'PFE']","[Shares of Novavax, Inc. NVAX dropped 13.3% on Sep 22 after analysts at JP Morgan recently downgraded the stock’s recommendation from Neutral to Underweight due to waning sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid.JP Morgan also cut the 12-month target price set on the company’s shares to $27, a substantial price cut from the earlier set target price of $132.The decision to revise the recommendation on Novavax’s stock by JP Morgan’s analysts was taken a month after the company announced alongside its second-quarter 2022 results that it is reducing its revenue guidance for 2022 by half. Management lowered the guidance for total 2022 revenues from the previously-expected guidance of $4-$5 billion to $2-$2.3 billion. The analysts at JP Morgan cited that they expect the company’s management to further slash these revenue forecasts based on the recent vaccine dynamic in Europe and the United States.The analysts also pointed out that Novavax faces “mid- and longer-term headwinds to meaningful Nuvaxovid uptake."" Per its Q2 earnings call, the company does not expect to generate revenues from vaccine sales in the United States and the World Health Organization-backed COVAX facility for the remainder of the year. Management acknowledged the fact that the late product launch of their COVID-19 vaccine and the dominance of mRNA-based vaccine developed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA was responsible for the loss of Novavax’s market share in the COVID vaccine market in the United States.Shares of Novavax have plunged 84.3% compared with the industry’s 26.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNovavax’s COVID-19 vaccine is also its first marketed product. However, the product launch was delayed by almost a year due to the postponement of the regulatory filing with the FDA. The FDA filing, supposed to have been done by management in May 2021, was completed after multiple delays in January 2022. This delayed filing resulted in a subsequent delay in emergency approval resulting in a substantial loss of market share for the company.Story continuesNovavax’s COVID vaccine is currently authorized in the United States and Europe as a primary two-dose regimen for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. However, the late product launch has been detrimental to the stock’s performance. A majority of the population has already completed primary vaccination using Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s approved mRNA-based vaccines.Last week, the vaccine received authorization in the European Union for use as a booster dose in adults aged 18 years and older. A regulatory filing is pending before the FDA authorization of the Novavax vaccine as a booster dose in adults.Compared to Novavax’s COVID vaccine, mRNA-based vaccines have high efficacy rates. The COVID-19 vaccines developed by Modernaand Pfizer/BioNTech are presently the only COVID-19 vaccines which have received full approval in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in both adults and adolescents. Both these vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States. A third and fourth booster dose of Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have been authorized for certain age groups by the FDA.Novavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. Earlier this month, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech also secured EUA from the FDA for their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose. While Moderna’s Omicron booster is approved for individuals 18 years of age and older, Pfizer/Moderna’s version is approved for people 12 and older. These vaccines have been specifically developed to cater to the U.S. market, where the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 are the most prevalent variants.Novavax is also advancing its own Omicron-based COVID vaccine in clinical development. While the top-line data is expected in third-quarter 2022, management expects to initiate a regulatory filing with the FDA for this Omicron-specific vaccine candidate by 2022-end.Novavax, Inc.

144,60590a6e-4cfe-338f-9c05-b2439b2319ce,PFE,2022-09-24,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001870.html,1663938601,STORY,['PFE'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Axis Capital (AXS) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.43 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.32%. This compares to the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry's yield of 0.96% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 2.38%. Check Axis Capital (AXS) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.59% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.74% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.35 per share, TrustCo Bank (TRST) has a dividend yield of 4.2%. This is compared to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.15% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.75%. Check TrustCo Bank (TRST) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It recently announced the debut of the iconic series Cops on Fox Nation, which will feature new episodes every Friday.The first series of Cops, an action-packed police series received overwhelming reactions from the audience and Fox expects this season to be a hit as well.Fox Nation, which is an entertainment streaming service designed to complement the Fox News Channel (“FNC”), is further expanding its portfolio with original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back (to be streamed on Sep 26) and the upcoming Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner.Fox also signed Roseanne Barr, a comedy icon in America for a comedy show named A Roseanne Comedy Speciala few days ago.The Fox News Channel has been benefiting from Fox Nation as it increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.Fox News Channel once again closed August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months as it reached more than 2.9 billion total multiplatform minutes, 1.5 billion total multiplatform views and 77 million multiplatform unique visitors, per Comscore data.Along with this, Fox Business is also driving its user base as it achieved 151 million multiplatform views as of last month. Fox Business surpassed CNN Business and Comcast’s (CMCSA) MSNBC in multiplatform views for the fifth straight month.Comcast’s MSNBC lost 19% of prime-time viewers in the first half of 2022. Per Nielsen data,their ratings have plummeted ever since The Rachel Maddow show shifted to a once-per-week format from four times per week.Fox’s investment in Flutter has benefitted its sports business division as well. Together they entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the U.S. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game, which has generated a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022.Story continuesHowever, the wagering business will not be easy for Fox given that it faces stiff competition from companies like DraftKings (DKNG).DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and the feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.What’s Next for Fox Corp?Fox’s shares have declined 13% year to date compared with Comcast, which fell by 35.5% during the same period. The Zacks Consumer &amp; Discretionary Sectoralso declined 37.2% over the same time frame.However, Fox’s cable TV business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This cord-cutting does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox also faces competition for ad dollars, which forms its main source of revenue. This is further intensified by offerings from tech giants like Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars.Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.However, Fox remains confident for fiscal 2023 as the financial gains from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of its next major distribution cycle are expected to deliver record revenues and EBITDA.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -9.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share, indicating a change of -14.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 points to a change of -14.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 indicates a change of +19.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Paypal is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PYPL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.84 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.91 billion and $31.56 billion estimates indicate +10% and +13.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $6.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.1%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $1.15 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +9.41%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Further, Cognizant will aid Freshfields in its digital transformation, reduce operational costs and drive investments in other parts of its business.Cognizant has been constantly expanding its partner base by signing multi-year deals with firms like Organon and Albertsons Companies. This has helped CTSH to drive its revenue growth with constant client acquisitions.The adoption of digital solutions has been slower in legal service firms. However, the firms are at an inflection point with changing dynamics in the world of commerce and geopolitics and are transitioning to digital operating models. In order to benefit from this, Cognizant has inked this strategic partnership with Freshfields to benefit from the new trends in the market amid the fourth industrial revolution.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and ConsensusCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Price and ConsensusCognizant Technology Solutions Corporation price-consensus-chart | Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation QuoteCognizant Addressing New Trends to Aid Share PriceCognizant’s recent investments in developing its digital business model has helped the company address the changing dynamics and contribute to its top-line growth.In the second quarter of 2022, revenues of $4.9 billion grew 9.5% at constant currency (cc). The growth was led by digital revenues, which accounted for 50% of revenues and increased 13% year over year.However, Cognizant’s shares have been negatively impacted by the current macroeconomic situation and geopolitical tensions. Various factors like labor cost inflationary pressure, interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine war have negatively impacted its outlook.Story continuesShares of Cognizant have lost 30.2% year to date compared with the Zacks Business-Software Services industry’s decline of 36.1%.Further complicating the situation, Cognizant is also facing a significant threat in the AI industry and the cloud space from companies like International Business Machines IBM and Accenture ACN.IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, which will drive its top-line growth. IBM recently expanded its collaboration with the U.S. federal government to address current problems like cybersecurity and supply chain sustainability via its data fabric solutions and IBM Watson.Accenture is improving its market share in the industry with its recent acquisition of digital engineering and operational technology from Trancom ITS. This will help Accenture provide customers with cloud-based logistics systems and merge warehouse operations with IoT and sensor technology.However, Cognizant, currently carrying Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will benefit from significant growth in its digital business operations, which is outgrowing the BPO market, reflecting momentum in AI, AR, automation, blockchain, IoT, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions.

This is because shippers contract the midstream assets for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, indicating less exposure to oil and gas price and volume risks.The partnership’s assets involve a network of pipelines that carry crude oil and refined products. It also generates cashflows from fuel distribution operations. In the prolific supply basins in the United States, MPLX has natural gas and natural gas liquids processing and fractionation facilities. Apart from gauging low-carbon opportunities, MPLX is banking on several organic growth projects.Strong and stable operations back the partnership to persistently grow its distributable cash flow (DCF). In 2021, the partnership generated $4.8 billion in DCF, higher than the year-ago level of $4.3 billion. MPLX generated a free cash flow of $1,349 million for the second quarter, which increased from $1,210 million in second-quarter 2021.The partnership has a strong focus on returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, it paid out more than $750 million of capital to unitholders through distributions and unit repurchases. Also, MPLX’s board of directors authorized a unit repurchase program of up to $1 billion of the outstanding publicly traded common units.Thus, MPLX stock appears to be a solid bet, based on the strong fundamentals and compelling business prospects.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked players in the energy space are RPC Inc. RES, Liberty Energy LBRT and Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC.

159,cfcf9341-0774-328e-85cc-28609538eba8,MPC,2022-09-24,4 Stocks With Relative Price Strength for Volatile Times,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-relative-price-strength-120212989.html,1663934532,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'DINO', 'MPC', 'MUSA', 'UNM']","[The Fed’s latest move to raise its core interest rate by another 0.75% has cast a pall over the stock market. It led to a precipitous drop in the equity indices on Thursday — marking the third consecutive day of declines and falling to lows not seen since July. With this, the Fed Fund rate jumped to the range of 3-3.25% from a mere 0-0.25% in early March. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% so far in 2022.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.As such, trading is expected to be choppy for the U.S. stock markets going ahead, even as investors have been witnessing extreme volatility since the beginning of 2022. Risks stemming from recession fears, geopolitical tensions and dwindling liquidity may also lead to a rough road for equities.In the current jittery market environment, for investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup, it is time to focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Screening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.Here are the four stocks that made it through the screen:HF Sinclair DINO: HF Sinclair is a producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Dallas, TX-based firm indicates 817.1% year-over-year earnings per share growth. DINO has a VGM Score of A.HF Sinclair beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 710.1%, on average. DINO shares have gained 61.6% in a year.Marathon Petroleum MPC: Based in Findlay, OH, the company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products.

""Ultium has not agreed"" to recognize the UAW without a vote, Curry said.Ultium on Friday did not endorse the UAW proposal, but said it ""respects workers’ right to unionize and the efforts of the UAW or any other union to organize battery-cell manufacturing workers at our manufacturing sites.""The joint venture said it would comply with a federal labor law that ""protects our employees’ right to decide the issue of union representation through a voluntary democratic election.""The 2.8 million square foot Ultium Cells LLC plant in Lordstown is the first of at least four U.S. plants planned to supply GM electric vehicles. The plant has more than 800 employees and is preparing to ramp up production.GM previously expressed support for efforts by the UAW to organize Ultium's battery plants, but did not endorse ""card check.In May, President Joe Biden, in a trip to South Korea, expressed support for workers seeking to unionize joint venture battery plants. Detroit's Big Three automakers all have battery plants in the works with Korean partners.Story continues""For every joint venture that manufactures electric vehicle batteries would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships with America unions,"" Biden said.Last month, GM and LG Energy said they were considering a site in New Carlisle, Indiana, for a fourth U.S. battery plant.They are already building a $2.6 billion battery cell plant in Lansing, Michigan, set to open in late 2024, and a $2.3 billion Tennessee plant to be completed in 2023.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc in FocusBased in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -22.87%. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.88%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.42% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $6 is up 25% from last year. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 13.56%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc's current payout ratio is 42%. This means it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for PNC for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $14.43 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 1.76%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, PNC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's market valuation decreased by US$5.3b after the stock price dropped 7.0% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Target Target Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Robert Harrison, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$453k worth of shares at a price of US$218 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$153. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Target didn't buy any shares in the last year.

In total, Chief Accounting Officer Matthew Liegel dumped US$213k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Target insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$166m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Target Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 43% over a half decade. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 36%. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 22% in thirty days. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 11% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for WestRock To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.WestRock became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Revenue is actually up 5.6% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthWestRock is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling WestRock stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for WestRock the TSR over the last 5 years was -34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that WestRock shareholders are down 35% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 22%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 6% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for WestRock  that you should be aware of.Of course WestRock may not be the best stock to buy.

The central bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the third consecutive time and promised more such increases would be coming as it tries to tame rampant inflation. Because it's simultaneously continuing its policy of quantitative tightening -- or selling its vast portfolio of U.S. Treasuries accumulated during its decade-plus of quantitative easing -- that promises difficult times for the economy and the stock market.Continue reading]

(NASDAQ:ADI) stock at an average price of US$165 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. The company's market worth decreased by US$3.8b over the past week after the stock price dropped 4.9%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, sold US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$166 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$142. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in Analog Devices than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Analog Devices Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Analog Devices. Specifically, Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology Vivek Jain ditched US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Analog Devices insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$253m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought Analog Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Analog Devices. For example - Analog Devices has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

After a grueling bear market in 2022, investors are enjoying a better start to this year. And leading the way are the best growth stocks which might have finally turned the corner.However, the technology industry is still facing plenty of risks. For example, supply chains remain unsettled, interest rates remain high, and the Federal Reserve seems set to hike rates a couple more times before its tightening campaign is completed. So don’t necessarily expect smooth sailing for tech stocks going forward.But there are finally some signs of optimism in the stock market. And, after the huge selloff we saw in 2022,  the valuations of many growth stocks are quite attractive. These seven growth stocks should post superior returns in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSMTaiwan Semiconductor$89DDOGDatadog$72.60VVisa$223AIC3.ai$13STMSTMicroelectrnics$41.72BROSDutch Bros$30UUnity Software$27.65Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)image of TSM semiconductor office buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock has rallied sharply over the past quarter. Despite that, its shares are still down more than 35% over the past 12 months.The sharp decline of TSM stock was especially shocking as Taiwan Sem is one of the world’s most important tech companies. It is far and away the world’s largest contract producer of computer chips and integrated circuits, and the company retains a market capitalization north of $400 billion.In addition to the general tech malaise, there were specific reasons behind Taiwan Semiconductor’s decline. For one thing, the demand for semiconductors fell in 2022 after booming for an extended period heading into last year. On top of that, political tensions are mounting between Taiwan and China. If China launches a military strike against Taiwan, TSM would face real, potentially catastrophic risk.Story continuesThat said, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing seems cheap enough to be worth the risk, as its shares are now trading at 15 times analysts’ average forward earnings estimate for the chip maker.Moreover, the company has started expanding production facilities in Arizona to reduce its geopolitical risk while also taking advantage of subsidies from the CHIPS Act which promotes U.S.-based chip manufacturing.And rounding out the bull case, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) disclosed that it has taken a big stake in Taiwan Semi stock.Datadog (DDOG)The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.Source: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG)  provides cloud monitoring and security functions via software-as-a-service solutions.  Datadog’s appeal lies in its all-in-one platform.In other words, DDOG’s  clients can monitor and secure their servers, workflows, databases, and their other IT hardware from one central location. In contrast, traditional solutions are compartmentalized, creating potential blind spots and vulnerabilities. Having all these functions in one place makes it easier for firms’ IT professional to look at everything simultaneously.Datadog has had tremendous success. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s 2022 sales to come in at $2.2 billion, up from $101 million in 2017. And analysts’ mean estimates call for its top line to increase 33% annually in the coming years.Datadog isn’t a tremendous profit machine yet, but it is in the black. The fact that it isn’t burning cash is a big advantage as many tech names struggle. Datadog has plenty of time to keep growing its business and become a leader among tech names in the future.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comIt’s no secret that the credit card companies are incredible businesses. They impose, in effect, a transaction tax on the global economy. As the world grows, Visa (NYSE:V) effortlessly makes more money. But, folks might wonder, doesn’t this growth have to come to an end at some point?It’s true that Visa’s market will eventually be saturated. But it’s not there yet. Emerging markets offer tremendous opportunities for Visa and its peers to continue converting vendors from cash to credit. In addition, the pandemic caused rapid adoption of touch-free payments solutions which usually require  a credit or debit card.Visa has added, positive drivers for 2023. The return of international travel and tourism coming out of the pandemic has done wonders for Visa, as it charges much higher fees on international transactions which involve multiple currencies.As if that weren’t enough, the weakening U.S. dollar will now aid Visa as well. Visa reported a significant reduction in its earnings in 2022 thanks to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This caused Visa’s revenues from other regions such as Europe to be worth less in dollars.Now, however, the value of the dollar has dropped 10% over the past quarter, and that will greatly boost Visa’s earnings .C3.ai (AI)Robot hand touching fingertips with human hand through a screen. represents ai and machine learning stocksSource: ShutterstockC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is an enterprise-focused, artificial intelligence company. The company’s software platform helps customers design and build AI-powered tools for working with, processing, and visualizing data.C3.ai has been a disappointing investment since going public, with the shares dropping from a peak of $161 in 2020 to just $13 per share today.However, 2023 could be the turning point for C3.ai. For one thing, investors’ demand for AI stocks is surging thanks to ChatGPT, an AI-powered tool. The rapid growth in the popularity of ChatGPT has helped awaken interest in AI technologies.Moreover, C3.ai has a fantastic balance sheet. It has $8 per share of net cash on its balance sheet, meaning that investors are paying just $5 per share for its actual business. Furthermore, the company already has more than $250 million of annual revenues, while its market capitalization is down to $1.3 billion.C3.ai got off to a slow start as it initially focused on relatively slow-growth industries such as oil and gas. However, C3.ai has started winning big contracts with the Department of Defense, which should set the stage for investors to give this company a higher valuation. That, plus the company’s huge cash balance, makes AI stock a good pick for the rest of the year.STMicroelectronics (STM)STMicroelectronics buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSTMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is a chip maker The firm is broadly diversified and has exposure to a number of promising fields and applications within the semiconductor industry.STMicroelectronics develops silicon carbide chips used by power and electronics companies.  STM also creates chips that power internet of things products and 3D sensors. STMicroelectronics should prosper from the proliferation of of  smart autos, along with increased opportunities in the transportation sector as that space becomes more electrified.STM stock looks exceptionally cheap at the moment, as the shares are trading for just 11 times both the company’s  current and forward earnings. The risk is that chip makers might face a glut, as the sector’s inventories have risen.That said, STM stock should be a winner over the long haul, given its attractive  valuation and the multiple, promising end markets which STMicroelectronics serves.Dutch Bros (BROS)Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona.Source: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.comDutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) is a small, rapidly growing coffee-shop chain. The firm is aiming to disrupt Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Starbucks has long dominated the American coffee market with its sit-down cafe experience. However, the pandemic changed people’s relationship with cafes and caused many folks to rethink their daily rituals.Meanwhile, demographics are also changing. Starbucks does well with millennials and older consumers. However, Dutch Bros wisely figured out that Gen Z — aka the “zoomers” — might want something else.Dutch Bros has ditched large stores, instead choosing tiny locations designed to support take-out customers. In addition, Dutch Bros focused on sweet, colorful beverages that look good on social media.The company has also made a point of hiring personable, engaging staff. With all of Starbucks’ current labor tensions and union drives, Dutch Bros could have an advantage on that front as well.Dutch Bros is still a small operation, with annual revenues of around $700 million. However, it plans to go from its current store base of around 550 stores to 4,000 in the coming years. That growth could draw significant interest from investors.In the meantime, 23% of the available shares of BROS stock are being sold short, setting the stage for a major short squeeze when the sentiment towards the name improves.Unity Software (U)image of someone playing video games to represent gaming stocksSource: korobskyph / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) is the operator of a leading graphics engine. Developers use the company’s graphics engine to design and run video games. Recently, Unity has begun to expand its operations into other areas, such as video animation, architecture, and e-commerce.Unity, along with its key rival, Unreal, control the majority of the video-game-engine market. It’s difficult for  other companies to take share from Unity as many developers have become accustomed to using its platform .Unity’s claim to fame is that its engine works seamlessly across platforms. A developer can build a game for, say, PCs, and then easily release that same game for use in conjunction with consoles, mobile, and even virtual/augmented reality.In fact, Unity has long been a leader in developing graphics for virtual reality apps. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wanted to acquire Unity years ago to serve as the core of its planned virtual reality operations. That acquisition could have come in handy, given how much Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) has spent trying to build its own metaverse recently.Unity is still working on monetization and has struggled to become profitable. The firm is reliant on ads at the moment, and that would pose a risk if the economy contracts. Regardless, the consumption of video games and related applications should grow meaningfully, making Unity a winner regardless of  any near-term macro setbacks.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held long positions in V, BRK-B, FB, and U stock.

This gives SBA Communications great scope to capitalize on the upbeat trend.It has a resilient and stable site-leasing business model as it generates most of its revenues from long-term (typically 5-10 year) tower leases that have built-in rent escalators.Moreover, with wireless service providers continuing to lease additional antenna space on the company’s towers amid the increase in network use, data transfer, network expansion and network coverage requirements, SBAC’s site-leasing revenue growth is likely to remain robust.SBA Communications has been focusing on enhancing and expanding its tower portfolio through the extension of its business into select international markets with high growth characteristics. In the second quarter, it acquired 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil for total cash consideration of $127.3 million and built 100 towers. It is also under contract to acquire roughly 2,600 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million.Thus, portfolio expansion positions the company well to take advantage of the secular trends in mobile data usage and wireless spending growth across the globe.SBA Communications maintains a healthy balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. As of Aug 1, 2022, the company had $480 million outstanding under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. This gives it ample financial flexibility to pursue its growth endeavors.Moreover, SBAC carries out share buybacks and announces dividend hikes from time to time. This demonstrates the company’s commitment to driving shareholder value alongside boosting shareholders’ confidence in the stock.Analysts seem bullish about the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has been revised marginally upward in the past week to $12.17.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of SBAC have declined 9.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 18.0%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, SBA Communications has a high customer concentration, with Verizon VZ, AT&amp;T T and T-Mobile TMUS accounting for the majority of its domestic site-leasing revenues. Notably, in the second quarter of 2022, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon accounted for 40.8%, 29.0% and 20.2%, respectively, of SBAC’s domestic site-leasing revenues.Therefore, the loss of any of these customers, consolidation among them or a reduction in network spending is likely to hurt the company’s top line significantly.SBA Communications has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with a high debt-to-capital ratio compared with the industry average. This limits its strength to withstand any credit crisis and unexpected negative externalities in the future.Also, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Regions Financial (RF) is a stock many investors are watching right now. RF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 8.94, which compares to its industry's average of 9.56. Over the last 12 months, RF's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.16 and as low as 7.77, with a median of 9.94.RF is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. RF's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.67. Within the past year, RF's PEG has been as high as 1.48 and as low as 0.27, with a median of 0.63.We should also highlight that RF has a P/B ratio of 1.38. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.87. Over the past year, RF's P/B has been as high as 1.46 and as low as 1.11, with a median of 1.31.Story continuesFinally, our model also underscores that RF has a P/CF ratio of 7.92. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.16. RF's P/CF has been as high as 8.42 and as low as 6.22, with a median of 7.41, all within the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Regions Financial's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that RF is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:V) Not Flying Under The Radar,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-not-120055606.html,1664020855,STORY,['V'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 26.7x Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Visa has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Visa peKeen to find out how analysts think Visa's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Visa?Visa's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 37%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 32% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.7% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Visa is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Visa's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our free balance sheet analysis for Visa with six simple checks on some of these key factors.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Visa.

(V): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-visa-inc-130001019.html,1663938001,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -11.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.1% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 12.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.41 points to a change of +25.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.38 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.6%. The $29.08 billion and $32.29 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.6% and +11%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.98 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.11%. The EPS surprise was +13.79%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We heard Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish tone. And that had investors searching for less risky assets. So let's take a look at the interactive here, as we see that it's down 3 and 1/3 of a percent there. But as we look for the week, we can see where it did take that turn after Jerome Powell's comments, down about 3 and 1/2% for the week.And let's also take a look at Ethereum. A similar story there. That's down more than 3%. But of course, that's been doing even worse, getting additional pressure following the merge if we take a look back there, and we see how that's been faring over the past month ever since that merger there, dropping as you can see about almost 22%.Now you also have other news putting pressure on some of these other crypto tokens. On Friday, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, said it's launching a sweeping review of cryptocurrencies to assess national security and law enforcement threats to really crack down on illicit use.So you're seeing many of them pressured here, as we take a quick whip through. Really, the only one in the green at the moment is Dogecoin. That seems to be the only one that's actually doing well on the day. We see a few of them in the green. Doge there, obviously, an Elon Musk favorite, but many of them still under pressure.Now we are going to see that the IRS is also going to be digging into potential crypto tax evaders using crypto broker sFOX. And that's at the request of the Southern District of New York. So you can expect more scrutiny ahead. And of course, illicit use potential, which was one of the many shots fired from JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon on crypto, as he and other bank CEOs testified this week. Now he really did re-up his disdain for crypto tokens. Take a listen.Story continuesJAMIE DIMON: You have to separate blockchain, which is real, DeFi, which is real, ledgers, tokens that do something and deliver information, money, ideas, simplify smart contracts. That's one thing. I'm not a skeptic. OK, I'm a major skeptic on crypto tokens, which you call currency, like Bitcoin. They are decentralized Ponzi schemes. And the notion that it's good for anybody is unbelievable.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So he's a fan of blockchain, though, and he did say that the bank actually uses it. But the individual tokens, he's described as potentially and just insanity at this point, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Rachelle, the wild ride in Bitcoin this week clearly reflected in some of those crypto stocks. We can see Coinbase, it was lowered its price target from JP Morgan there down to $60. That stock getting hit today. Block getting downgraded by Mizuho earlier this week, slashing their price target from 125 to 57. So that really reflects the broader crypto environment right now and all that selling pressure that we've seen play out in the crypto space here over the last couple of months.]"

They also argued that Imperial is a high-priced competitor that purchases raw sugar to refine and does not compete to lower prices.They also argued that the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitors sugar prices and can increase imports if needed to address price increases.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study News'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for News How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for News is:8.3% = US$760m ÷ US$9.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.News' Earnings Growth And 8.3% ROEAt first glance, News' ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 14% either. Despite this, surprisingly, News saw an exceptional 44% net income growth over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then compared News' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 2.4% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if News is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is News Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?News has a really low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 19%, meaning that it has the remaining 81% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, News has paid dividends over a period of seven years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that News' future ROE will be 7.1% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryIn total, it does look like News has some positive aspects to its business. Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

However, two that unquestionably come to the front of many minds are AT&amp;T T and Verizon Communications VZ.Both stocks reside in the Zacks Wireless National Industry, which is currently ranked in the top 36% of all Zacks Industries.Studies have shown that 50% of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group it’s in, making it crucial to ensure that investors target stocks in a thriving industry.In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.With both being titans residing in the same industry that’s highly ranked, it raises a valid question – which company looks like a better investment for income-focused investors?Let’s take a closer look.Price Action To better understand which stock investors have defended at a higher level, we can look at each company’s share performance across several timeframes.Year-to-date, VZ shares are down more than 20%, widely underperforming AT&amp;T’s decline of 11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd over the last year, the story has remained the same – Verizon Communications’ decline of nearly 25% widely lags AT&amp;T’s 18.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchClearly, market participants have favored T shares.Quarterly PerformanceNow, we can look at each company’s quarterly performance to see how business has fared.AT&amp;T has a strong earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven of its last ten quarters. Top-line results have also been strong, with T registering six revenue beats over its previous ten quarters.However, VZ has a slightly stronger earnings track record, with eight EPS and revenue beats over its last ten quarters.While T shares have been more powerful, VZ has a slightly stronger earnings track record.ValuationBoth companies’ shares trade at rock-solid valuation levels, with their forward earnings multiples nowhere near their five-year medians. Further, each company carries a Style Score of an A for Value.Story continuesStill, AT&amp;T’s 6.4X forward P/E ratio is slightly cheaper than Verizon’s 7.7X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile T shares are cheaper, it’s worth noting that both companies’ shares are trading at relatively low multiples.Dividends Perhaps the biggest perk of AT&amp;T and Verizon shares is their hefty annual dividend yields, as seen in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAt first glance, AT&amp;T looks like the sure winner here, with its 6.8% annual dividend yield edging out Verizon’s 6.4% annual dividend yield.However, Verizon has upped its dividend payout six times over the last five years, whereas AT&amp;T has upped its dividend payout four times in the same period.In addition, VZ’s 2.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate easily edges out AT&amp;T’s value of -2.3%.While T’s annual dividend yield is slightly higher, VZ’s dividend growth metrics make it the clear-cut winner.Growth EstimatesOf course, growth projections are a major deciding factor in selecting stocks.For Verizon’s current fiscal year, earnings are expected to decline by 3.7%. However, the earnings picture kicks back into green in FY23, with the bottom line forecasted to tack on 2.4%.Further, VZ’s top line is in decent shape; revenue is forecasted to climb 2% in FY22 and a further 1.5% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to AT&amp;T, earnings are forecasted to decline by 26% in FY22. And in FY23, the company’s earnings are forecasted to slip a further 1.7%.Revenue is projected to drop 25% in FY22 and an additional 3.2% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a much stronger growth profile.Bottom LineWhile it’s undoubtedly hard to choose between these two wireless titans, both have advantages and disadvantages.AT&amp;T T shares have performed at a much higher level and are currently cheaper.However, Verizon Communications VZ has a stronger earnings track record, more robust dividend metrics, and notably better growth projections.Still, both companies have displayed remarkable relative strength in 2022 and pay investors handsomely, undoubtedly perks that all market participants seek.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

196,3e25e51c-0dad-3089-aee1-728c3ebed546,VZ,2022-09-24,Investors Heavily Search Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verizon-communications-130001376.html,1663938001,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -8.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.1% change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 8.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share, indicating a change of -9.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.31 indicates a change of +2.4% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.5%. The $136.33 billion and $138.29 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2% and +1.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $33.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.1%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.16%. The EPS surprise was -2.24%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To achieve this ambition, we are rethinking product life cycle, reuse and repair, and through innovative design, we are working towards a sustainable, circular economy.In April 2021, Coach launched (Re)Loved, a program that gives bags a second life by allowing customers the opportunity to trade pre-owned Coach bags for store credit. These bags are then reimagined as part of the Coach (Re)Loved collection. Coach (Re) Loved consists of Coach's Upcrafted collection, oneof-a-kind products reimagined by Coach designers and craftspeople, and Coach Restored bags, which are carefully brought back to their original condition. When a bag is beyond repair, the Coach Remade collection deconstructs those pre-owned bags to repurpose them as small, playful objects. Coach (Re)Loved is paving the way for new circular models and is reimagining the idea of a bag's end of life.In FY2021, we continued to offer free leather care to our customers, and our Repair Workshops helped customers maintain and repair their own bags. Our Coach (Re)Loved &amp; Repair Workshop in New Jersey repaired more than 9,058 bags. Though significantly down due to COVID-19, this makes up 76% of products returned to Coach in the U.S. Additionally, our Global Customer Experience Team tracked and managed over 61,000 repairs by local Coach or outsourced repair specialists across Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. Over the last three years, our teams have managed approximately 266,000 repairs for our customers.Tapestry's ESG &amp; Sustainability Team partnered with graduate students as part of a course at Columbia University's M.S. Sustainability Management program to evaluate the life cycle impacts of a single Coach product, the Swinger bag, across different lifetime uses. It was found that reimagining the Coach Swinger bag under Coach Upcrafted can reduce annualized emissions by 76% compared to a typical Coach bag life cycle. We also gained insight into our product's environmental impact along the supply chain stages and are using these findings to target areas for improvement. We worked with a third-party organization to externally verify this life cycle assessment and confirm its accuracy. Moving forward, we hope to scale this work with future product life cycle assessments.Story continuesRead MoreTapestry, Inc., Friday, September 23, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.tapestry.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717232/Tapestrys-Circularity-Sustainable-Product-Design-Life-Cycle-Assessment-Reuse-and-Repair]"

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.72% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.01%.Coming into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had lost 29.88% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 11.99%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 9.09%.Nvidia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.74, down 36.75% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.99 billion, down 15.73% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.50 per share and revenue of $27.46 billion. These totals would mark changes of -21.17% and +2.03%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

But they can't keep falling forever.And Slack Founder Stewart Butterfield hinted that pretty soon, the valuations on great businesses will be too tempting for investors to ignore.“The multiples have probably come down to something that looks pretty reasonable,” the longtime tech industry executive told Yahoo Finance Live at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference. Slack, which was acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion in 2021, has played a starring role at Dreamforce with new platform innovations such as Canvas.Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive officer of Slack, waits to do a television interview after ringing the opening bell the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), June 20, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Butterfield acknowledged that for the technology sector, “the last six months have been pretty rough.”In September, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time since June. Higher interest rates raise the cost of capital for many tech companies that thrive on new funding to spur growth. Further, with rates on a steeper trajectory, as the Fed indicated on Wednesday, the economy could slow quicker than expected and put pressure on elevated tech multiples.Consequently, tech stocks experienced a fresh round of selling this week. Popular tech stocks such as Meta, AMD, Intel, Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Spotify saw declines as the Nasdaq Composite shed more than 5% during the week.“The open question for investors is still: Do we see a change in demand and therefore an actual change in performance?” Butterfield said. “Because the multiples are probably about good, and if we collectively determine that we’re not going to see a real decrease in demand, we’re not going to see a real decrease in economic growth, then I think we have a lot of upside from here.”In Butterfield's view, demand remains solid, underscoring the idea that investors may be missing good fundamental stories.""What tech investors want is visibility into a calm economic environment,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Eric Sheridan told Yahoo Finance Live at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference earlier this month.Story continues""Tech, by its very nature, is a risk-premium, risk-on category of investing,"" Sheridan added, ""and when people are uncertain about what's the rate of inflation, what's happening in the macroeconomic environment, what is the Fed going to do — it all trickles into the conversation and it creates uncertainty. As a result, risk comes off, and names sell off in the group. So you really need a stable macro environment where people feel comfortable putting more risk back on in their portfolio.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Dan was just talking about some of those individual movers here, some of the larger players within the tech space that have clearly had a very troublesome 2022. Today, looking at the NASDAQ, now it's below 11,000. I know that was a level-- a key level that you were watching. What's your takeaway from the selling that we're seeing once again today?RAY WANG: Yeah, it's a bad day when everyone's talking about you're just a little bit about your 52-week low. And that's kind of what we're talking about at the moment. And a lot of it's really the rate hikes. There doesn't seem to be the Fed-- it doesn't seem like it's going to pivot away from the strategy. They're definitely taking the Volcker approach and going head on, trying to address this.The challenge is it's really a policy issue. It's not really a Fed policy. They can't do much for headline inflation, which is food and energy. And now we've got wage inflation that's picking up as a result. So I think we've got some time here. Before that, we're going to see some rates dropping. But this is also, another way to look at it, it is still a good time to buy. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm looking at companies in the MATANA stocks that are large double digit operating margins, that have a lot of cash on hand. And a number of those stocks come into mind.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we love that MATANA acronym there. What about the weakest performers in that group? Who are you most concerned about?RAY WANG: Yeah, the one I'm most concerned about is Nvidia, and it's really about trying to get the chip demand back into space. Part of the reason is they had a real good run when there was a lot of cryptocurrency mining that was going on. They had a good run when there's a lot of work in terms of gaming, and of course, when data centers are doing well. I don't think the data center piece is going to collapse. I think the data center piece is actually growing as more and more people move their workloads into the cloud.Story continuesThe GPU thesis is still very strong. It's just that they've been compensating for a lot of headwinds, anything from regulatory environment in terms of chip export and technology exports to what's been going on the broader scale in terms of overall consumption and overall economic recession fears in APAC, which hasn't picked up.DAVE BRIGGS: Ray, what's the investor story ahead for Apple? And how significant are the new additions? We can go back to the phone that is in stores now. I know the watch for the athletes is there and the new AirPods as well.RAY WANG: Yeah, no, the Apple story is actually going to be the bright light among the MATANA group for a lot of reasons, right? The fundamentals are there, right? You've got 1.2 billion devices. You've got something like 800 billion devices that have not been onto 5G yet. There's more demand for the iPhone 14 than there was for the 13. And we're seeing all the stops from the carrier discounts across the board.They're also in a really good position, $202 billion of cash on hand. They're highly profitable with about 39% operating margins. And this supercycle is going to help, right? The watch, right? I've got one on right now, right? I don't have the ultra, but you're seeing a lot of people choose Apple because of features like the ability to use SOS with satellite connectivity, or really, the ability to do fall and crash detection, or the ability to integrate back to the healthcare pieces that people worry about, much more so in the post-pandemic phase.So they're in really good position. They've done a good job building their services revenue, which we think is going to head more than 25% in the next two years. So overall, they're in one of the best spots.SEANA SMITH: Certainly are a number of reasons to be bullish on these names here in the long-term, Ray, but taking a look at the shorter term, right, because there are still a number of headwinds here. We have high inflation. We have rising rates. We have the fact that we've seen a pullback in ad spending. I guess, what is it going to be? What is the catalyst that it's going to take to really turn things around for the sector?RAY WANG: I think the biggest catalyst are really things that I don't really get excited about, the fact that we're going to have unemployment rates go up or the fact that we're going to have, like, more recessionary numbers, right? So all the negative numbers are required for us to get out of this hawkish Fed stance. They're not things we get excited about. But they have to happen before things stabilize, right?Right now, I mean, if you've got cash, I mean, you're probably going to be holding on to it for just a little bit longer, or you might be getting two-year notes, right? Wait until the market gets better. But there's still a lot of opportunities in the market, but you're going to have to figure out which are the quality stocks.You're going to be picking stocks as opposed to going into categories. For example, if you look at the FedEx situation, that is really a FedEx situation, as opposed to a global kind of indicator. There are 2/3 FedEx, 1/3 global. And I think people have to realize those types of nuances when they're looking at the stocks.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Ray, what about Tesla? What about the EV space? What are you watching there?RAY WANG: Well, what I'm excited about Tesla, and as we've talked about many times, is that Tesla is not an automobile company. It's a tech company. And what they're doing is they're positioning themselves as not only the key stock in everyone's ESG portfolio, but also a vertically integrated market. Their ability to take anything from the battery to the final production of the car to the data collection brings them new opportunities.For example, they can do their own underwriting for insurance, which I know that they're heavily jumping into. Their ability to use computer vision instead of LiDAR to actually do autonomous vehicles and be able to actually do that mapping and identify obstacles puts them in a better position than many of the autonomous vehicle manufacturers. Their ability to actually have their own power production in terms of the batteries, in terms of being due to their battery plants, gives them a huge advantage to everyone else.And with the mandates that are coming to get to electronic vehicles depending on the state and the country where you are, right, they're in a very good position to be able to ramp up production. And so we'll be watching to see what their production numbers are and how they compare.]"

Tech reporter Dan Howley with us here with what we hope is maybe a little bit of optimism down the road. Hey, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, maybe a little bit further down the road than we would like. But let's talk about some of the big names in tech and how they performed. We look at the biggest one, obviously, Apple. They are suffering but not suffering as badly as some of their competitors. They're only down year to date about 15% as far as stock price goes. They announced their new iPhones, as well as their new Apple Watch and those AirPods.There's hope among analysts that into the holiday season, they'll see good sales of this, at least steady sales. This is the iPhone 14. They're hoping that it matches up as equally with the iPhone 13 as far as sales volumes go, especially in China and the US. We've also seen, obviously, Amazon take a big hit. That company's stock price, that's down around 32% year to date.They took a hit throughout the year because of some of those issues that we talked about with the actual sales side of things, the e-commerce side of things, where they weren't performing as well as during the pandemic. And they expanded largely to meet the demand for the pandemic. And so now they have to scale that back and kind of recalibrate.We also look at Google. Obviously, they've been hit as part of the kind of rearranging that's going on as a result of Apple's privacy changes in iOS 14. That stock price is down around 30%. Meta, that's really been slammed. That's going back to that Apple privacy change. They're down around 50% year to date.And then we look at something along the lines of an NVIDIA, which is also down more than 50% year to date. They've been slammed as a result of the chip issues that have been ongoing, as well as their forecasts that they're not seeing as robust sales as they wanted to prior to their most recent quarter. They had announced changes there. You know, it's all across the board here. Microsoft down as well. That's looking around 29%. And then we can look at, obviously, next to the S&amp;P 500, the only one that's looking good is Apple, which is actually trending above it.]"

The ongoing rebound in businesses within the Nano Group seems encouraging. The company’s growing investments in Project Accelerate 2.0 initiatives are an added advantage. However, headwinds such as unfavorable economic conditions and competitive threats continue to be concerns. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bruker’s second-quarter 2022 earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was driven by robust performances across all geographies and the BSI and BEST businesses. The company delivered robust bookings and backlog growth in the second quarter. Revenue recognition from one gigahertz class NMR system and the continued uptake of the timsTOF platform seem promising. The company’s NANO advanced X-ray and NANO surfaces tools delivered strong growth in the quarter. The expansion in gross margin amid ongoing inflationary headwinds is an upside.The BSI segment rose 2.9% year over year, including organic revenue growth of 8.1% in the second quarter. Organic bookings were up double digits percentages year over year, whereas the BSI book-to-bill ratio remained more than 1%. Geographically and on an organic basis, North American revenues rose in the high single-digit percentage.

The stock has declined 40.8% compared with the industry’s 31.7% fall. Bruker’s revenues for the second quarter of 2022 missed the consensus mark.The sales decline in CALID business does not bode well. Escalating operating expenses are concerning. In the reported quarter, selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 12.9%, whereas research and development expenses went up 6.8% year over year. This rise in operating expenses drove adjusted operating expenses by 11.1% year over year, leading to a 108 basis points contraction in adjusted operating margin.Further, the company continues to be challenged by supply chain disruptions and logistics delays, impacting business performance.Bruker also faces substantial competition in a consolidating industry and expects competition in all its markets to increase further . Bruker BioSpin competes with companies that offer magnetic resonance spectrometers, mainly JEOL and Oxford Instruments.

Yet persistent reimbursement pressure and competitive market offer tough challenges for Walgreens Boots. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens Boots exited third-quarter fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The U.S. pharmacy arm benefited from improved seasonal script trends. The U.S. retail business gained traction through digital and omnichannel growth from myWalgreens loyalty program, owned brand innovation and other profit streams.The company experienced improved online growth momentum with digital sales up 25% in the United States. Robust performance across health and wellness and personal care categories during the quarter instilled optimism. Further, the continued acceleration of automated microfulfillment centers was another notable upside during the quarter.Walgreens Boots also played a significant role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 4.7 million vaccinations and 3.9 million tests in the last reported quarter and more than 16 million boosters till the Q3 earnings release.

VillageMD had a total of 315 clinics opened by the quarter-end, indicating an increase of 97 clinics from the year-ago period.The intensifying competition in the U.S. retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings.

The stock has lost 28.5% compared with the industry’s 11.5% decline.Walgreens Boots’ fiscal third-quarter revenues fell shy of estimates and declined year over year. The top-line performance was affected by a sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens. Within the Pharmacy business, scripts continued to be challenged by temporary operating hour reductions owing to labor shortages. The company incurred a $683 million charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in the reported quarter.Contraction of gross margin does not bode well. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.8% year over year in the quarter under review. These mounting expenses resulted in an operating loss in the quarter, building pressure on the bottom line.We note that in the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins as well.

212,2de28996-4f95-3999-b7b5-d27c2c1c1bf0,MCK,2022-09-24,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Amedisys (AMED) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-amedisys-143802839.html,1663943882,STORY,"['AMED', '^GSPC', 'AMN', 'MCK', 'SWAV']","[Amedisys, Inc. AMED is gaining from continued strength in the Hospice business. The company’s earnings in the second quarter of 2022 were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The increased utilization of Licensed Practical Nurse (“LPN”) and Physical Therapist Assistant (“PTA”) buoys optimism. However, weak margins and stiff competition does not bode well for the company.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 30.6% compared with a 34.8% fall of the industry and a 16.2% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned home health and hospice service provider has a market capitalization of $3.60 billion. Amedisys’ earnings for the second quarter of 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.5%.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 27.3% compared with the industry’s 13.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4% increase. The company’s long-term projected growth of 7.7% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 11.4% and the S&amp;P 500’s expectation of 11.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Key Growth CatalystsImpressive Q2 Results: Amedisys ended the second quarter with better-than-expected earnings. In Home Health, the company performed 13.2 visits per episode, up 0.2 visits on a sequential basis. On clinical mix, the company achieved 48% LPN utilization and 53% PTA utilization. Within Hospice, same-store admissions grew 6% and the average daily census (“ADC”) was slightly positive at 0.2%. Continued progress on the ADC front is expected to help Amedisys drive performance in the second half of the year.The Contessa Health acquisition seems to be strategically aligned with Amedisys’ business. Total admissions for hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF)-at-home were 345, representing a 35% year-over-year growth for Contessa.Strategic Acquisitions to Add Value: We are optimistic about Amedisys’ latest acquisitions that complement its existing home care and hospice business. In April 2022, the company acquired certain home health assets from AssistedCare Home Health, Inc. and RH Homecare Services, LLC, doing business as AssistedCare Home Health and AssistedCare of the Carolinas, respectively. In the same month, Amedisys acquired Evolution Health to offer home health and hospice services in more communities across Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio.Story continuesManagement expects the company to have enough cash balance to make several such acquisitions in the future.Improving Clinical Quality: Amedisys is currently focusing on improving clinical quality. The company has implemented targeted action plans to improve the quality of care for patients. The company’s Home Health Quality of Patient Care Stars score was 4.49 stars for the second quarter, with 100% of care centers reaching 4 stars or greater.DownsidesContessa Results Challenged: Despite witnessing favorable growth, Amedisys’ high-acuity care segment, Contessa, was behind budget due to delays in closing scheduled partnerships. This volume represents 35% of the budgeted admissions missed for the second quarter.Pressure on Margins Remain: Amedisys’ gross margin contracted 196 basis points (bps) to 43.3% in the second quarter. Expenses on salaries and benefits rose 11.7%. Other expenses rose 0.3% year over year. These escalating expenses led to a 474-bps contraction in adjusted operating margin to 10.6%.Competitive Landscape: The market for home health and hospice is fragmented with several small local providers. With few barriers to entry in this market, Amedisys primarily faces tough competition from local privately and publicly-owned and hospital-owned healthcare providers.Estimate TrendIn the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amedisys’ 2022 earnings has moved north by 0.8% to $5.33.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.30 billion, suggesting a 3.9% rise from the 2021 reported number.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

The T-Cell Select reagent kit is currently available across Europe where CE marking is accepted, South Korea and China, and is rapidly becoming available in more markets worldwide.The T-SPOT.TB test is a globally regulated ELISPOT IGRA for detecting latent TB infection. Also, the test with the T-Cell Select reagent kit is currently the only automated IGRA TB test without regulatory (label) warnings for immunocompromised patients, who often have lower levels of T cells available to assess.The latest regulatory approval is likely to aid PerkinElmer in significantly solidifying its foothold in the global IVD space and boosting its Diagnostics business.Significance of the ApprovalThe T-Cell Select reagent kit allows for a more automated workflow, which has been designed to lessen the time spent by lab personnel and lower overall costs. The increased use of automation also improves blood sample logistics as it extends the period for which collected blood can be stored at room temperature. Thus, this extended blood sample stability enables easy centralization of sample processing, thereby expanding access to the T-SPOT.TB test and giving laboratories more flexibility to operate.Per management, automation is expected to close the gap between ELISPOT and ELISA laboratory workflows and enable more laboratories to offer the clinically superior T-SPOT.TB test to more physicians. This will likely enable PerkinElmer to provide the best quality of care for the most susceptible patients across the United States.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global IVD market is anticipated to reach $113.1 billion by 2026 from $98.2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 2.9%. Factors like the rising elderly population and the subsequent growth in the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases, and increasing adoption of fully automated and point of care instruments are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest regulatory approval is likely to provide a significant boost to PerkinElmer’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, PerkinElmer announced second-quarter 2022 results, registering a solid non-COVID organic growth. During the reported quarter, the company entered into an agreement with the intention to divest its Applied, Food and Enterprise Services businesses to New Mountain Capital.

BWA recently announced that it has entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement with Hubei Surpass Sun Electric (“SSE”). Per the deal, BorgWarner will acquire the Electric Vehicle Solution, Smart Grid and Smart Energy businesses of SSE. The transaction will have an enterprise value of nearly RMB 410 million, of which around RMB 267 million would be delivered at or soon after closing. It allows contingent payments of about RMB 143 million over a rough span of two years following the closing.The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and SSE shareholder approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.Based in Hubei province in China, SSE’s electrification business offers patented EV charging solutions to customers in China and more than 70 other countries. SSE has an excellent track record of delivering over 50,000 charging points and leading the engineering, procurement and construction of more than 250 charging station sites.BorgWarner is focused on expediting its fast-charging capabilities worldwide, so the recent development will be an added advantage for the company. BorgWarner’s strength in Europe and North America will complement SSE’s electrification efforts in China.BorgWarner’s ambitious Charging Forward project, announced last year to accelerate its electrification strategy, bodes well. Riding on soaring EV popularity, BorgWarner’s 2022 electrification revenues are expected to increase to above $850 million, more than doubling from 2021 levels. SSE, with its electrification potential, will support BorgWarner’s Charging Forward strategy as well.BorgWarner, through its strategic acquisitions, ensure solid growth prospects. The acquisition of AKASOL, completed in February 2022, has expanded its commercial vehicle electrification capabilities and is set to aid the top-line growth. For full-year 2022, BorgWarner anticipates net sales within $15.5-$16 billion, indicating an increase from $14.8 billion generated in 2021The buyout of Santroll's light vehicle eMotor business, which closed in March 2022, has further bolstered BorgWarner's scale in eMotor product leadership and enhanced manufacturing capabilities. The company expects the Santroll acquisition to drive around $300 million of revenues by 2025, inclusive of assumed revenue synergies. The buyout of Rhombus Energy, completed in August 2022, complements BorgWarner’s existing European charging footprint and expands the firm’s portfolio in North America. The acquisitions of Santroll’s light vehicle eMotor business and Rhombus are expected to increase year-over-year sales by $45-$55 million in 2022.In another noteworthy development, BorgWarner presented its electric commercial vehicle (eCV) electrification portfolio at the IAA Transportation 2022, currently being held in Germany.BorgWarner displayed a series of new solutions comprising the high-energy flat battery system, which features a new flat module architecture suitable for electrified lightweight commercial vehicles and buses. Also, its new modular high-voltage eFan system will ensure the highest efficiency and lowest noise. With a robust design, the system will score high on reliability and function under extreme conditions.BorgWarner’s industry-leading components and eCV portfolio demonstrate careful research and a conscious attempt to evolve to cleaner and more efficient energy sources. To pivot to a more sustainable future, the company is constantly upgrading and customizing its eCV solutions for use in light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and off-highway applications.Shares of BorgWarner have lost 20.8% over the past year compared with its industry’s decline of 43.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksBWA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.Some better-ranked players in the auto space are Yamaha Motor Co.

It recently announced the debut of the iconic series Cops on Fox Nation, which will feature new episodes every Friday.The first series of Cops, an action-packed police series received overwhelming reactions from the audience and Fox expects this season to be a hit as well.Fox Nation, which is an entertainment streaming service designed to complement the Fox News Channel (“FNC”), is further expanding its portfolio with original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back (to be streamed on Sep 26) and the upcoming Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner.Fox also signed Roseanne Barr, a comedy icon in America for a comedy show named A Roseanne Comedy Speciala few days ago.The Fox News Channel has been benefiting from Fox Nation as it increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.Fox News Channel once again closed August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months as it reached more than 2.9 billion total multiplatform minutes, 1.5 billion total multiplatform views and 77 million multiplatform unique visitors, per Comscore data.Along with this, Fox Business is also driving its user base as it achieved 151 million multiplatform views as of last month. Fox Business surpassed CNN Business and Comcast’s (CMCSA) MSNBC in multiplatform views for the fifth straight month.Comcast’s MSNBC lost 19% of prime-time viewers in the first half of 2022. Per Nielsen data,their ratings have plummeted ever since The Rachel Maddow show shifted to a once-per-week format from four times per week.Fox’s investment in Flutter has benefitted its sports business division as well. Together they entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the U.S. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game, which has generated a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022.Story continuesHowever, the wagering business will not be easy for Fox given that it faces stiff competition from companies like DraftKings (DKNG).DraftKings is focusing on its iGaming products as it launched a sportsbook in Kansas at the start of this month. Its Same Game Parlay, which allows multiple betting outcomes from the same game into one parlay bet and the feature enhancements like the Web3 strategy, has gained significant anticipation among players.What’s Next for Fox Corp?Fox’s shares have declined 13% year to date compared with Comcast, which fell by 35.5% during the same period. The Zacks Consumer &amp; Discretionary Sectoralso declined 37.2% over the same time frame.However, Fox’s cable TV business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This cord-cutting does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox also faces competition for ad dollars, which forms its main source of revenue. This is further intensified by offerings from tech giants like Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars.Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.However, Fox remains confident for fiscal 2023 as the financial gains from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of its next major distribution cycle are expected to deliver record revenues and EBITDA.

216,364830af-d1f9-3050-b6fb-8dc19c894c39,DIS,2022-09-24,Earnings growth of 191% over 1 year hasn't been enough to translate into positive returns for Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-growth-191-over-1-120022259.html,1664020822,STORY,['DIS'],"[The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 43%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 22%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 23% in that time. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 15% in a month. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 11% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.With the stock having lost 8.1% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the Walt Disney share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Walt Disney's revenue is actually up 28% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Walt Disney stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 22% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 43%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.But note: Walt Disney may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

They’re now available to stream only on Peacock in the U.S. Hulu, however, has all-new material for fans of the celebrity clan: “The Kardashians” reality series returned this week for Season 2.In addition, multiple seasons of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise are no longer on Hulu. Those include “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Seasons 1-15; “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” Seasons 1-13; “The Real Housewives of New Jersey: Seasons 1-11”; “The Real Housewives of New York” Seasons 1-12; “The Real Housewives of Orange County” Seasons 12-15; “The Real Housewives of Potomac” Seasons 1-5; and “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” Season 1.Also leaving Hulu were “Life of Kylie,” the reality series following Kylie Jenner that ran for just one season, along with Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” Seasons 1-8 (a spinoff of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”) and “Top Chef” Seasons 1-18. Also gone from Hulu as of Sept. 18 are “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” Seasons 1-8, now exclusively streaming on Peacock.The purge of past seasons of the NBCU-owned shows comes after Hulu also lost next-day access to current seasons of NBC series, effective Sept. 19, as those will now be available on Peacock Premium. NBCU had already reclaimed next-day episodes of Bravo shows earlier this summer.NBCU execs clearly hope that their reclamation of “KUWTK” and other popular shows will boost Peacock’s viewing hours — and subscribers. In the second quarter, Peacock’s paid customer based was flat at 13 million and Peacock’s overall active accounts dropped by 1 million.Story continuesMeanwhile, Disney is in the midst of trying to buy out the 33% stake in Hulu owned by Comcast’s NBCU.As of July 2, 2022, Disney recorded Comcast’s interest in Hulu as being worth $8.6 billion, implying a valuation of $25.8 billion. Under the agreement that gave Disney operational control over Hulu, Comcast in January 2024 has the right to require Disney to buy its Hulu ownership stake (and conversely, Disney has the right to force Comcast to sell it).Disney CEO Bob Chapek, at an investment conference earlier this month, signaled again that he wanted to reach a deal with Comcast to own 100% of Hulu prior to the January 2024 date spelled out in the agreement. Full ownership of Hulu, Chapek said, would be necessary for Disney to introduce a “hard bundle” that integrates Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Later, at the same conference, Comcast chief Brian Roberts suggested his company would be interested in buying out Disney’s 66% stake — and that an auction-style sale of Hulu in its entirety may fetch more than Disney’s implied valuation.Despite losing many top-tier titles to Peacock, Hulu will continue to offer some NBCU shows for several more years. Those include past seasons of “Law &amp; Order: SVU,” “This Is Us,” “The Mindy Project,” “30 Rock,” “Parenthood” and “Will &amp; Grace.” (The full NBCU live TV channel lineup — including NBC, E!, Bravo, USA and MSNBC — will still be available to Hulu + Live TV subscribers.)Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in October 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in October 202213 Supporting Actors Who Successfully Campaigned for Lead Categories at the Oscars]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.72%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.62%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.09%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the cable provider had lost 13.64% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 10.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.09% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Comcast as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.89, up 2.3% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $29.9 billion, down 1.31% from the prior-year quarter.CMCSA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.62 per share and revenue of $121.92 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +12.07% and +4.75%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.16% lower within the past month. Comcast is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Looking at its valuation, Comcast is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 8.97. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.85, so we one might conclude that Comcast is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 0.66 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Cable Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.66 at yesterday's closing price.The Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 79, which puts it in the top 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

They’re now available to stream only on Peacock in the U.S. Hulu, however, has all-new material for fans of the celebrity clan: “The Kardashians” reality series returned this week for Season 2.In addition, multiple seasons of Bravo’s “Real Housewives” franchise are no longer on Hulu. Those include “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Seasons 1-15; “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” Seasons 1-13; “The Real Housewives of New Jersey: Seasons 1-11”; “The Real Housewives of New York” Seasons 1-12; “The Real Housewives of Orange County” Seasons 12-15; “The Real Housewives of Potomac” Seasons 1-5; and “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” Season 1.Also leaving Hulu were “Life of Kylie,” the reality series following Kylie Jenner that ran for just one season, along with Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” Seasons 1-8 (a spinoff of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”) and “Top Chef” Seasons 1-18. Also gone from Hulu as of Sept. 18 are “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” Seasons 1-8, now exclusively streaming on Peacock.The purge of past seasons of the NBCU-owned shows comes after Hulu also lost next-day access to current seasons of NBC series, effective Sept. 19, as those will now be available on Peacock Premium. NBCU had already reclaimed next-day episodes of Bravo shows earlier this summer.NBCU execs clearly hope that their reclamation of “KUWTK” and other popular shows will boost Peacock’s viewing hours — and subscribers. In the second quarter, Peacock’s paid customer based was flat at 13 million and Peacock’s overall active accounts dropped by 1 million.Story continuesMeanwhile, Disney is in the midst of trying to buy out the 33% stake in Hulu owned by Comcast’s NBCU.As of July 2, 2022, Disney recorded Comcast’s interest in Hulu as being worth $8.6 billion, implying a valuation of $25.8 billion. Under the agreement that gave Disney operational control over Hulu, Comcast in January 2024 has the right to require Disney to buy its Hulu ownership stake (and conversely, Disney has the right to force Comcast to sell it).Disney CEO Bob Chapek, at an investment conference earlier this month, signaled again that he wanted to reach a deal with Comcast to own 100% of Hulu prior to the January 2024 date spelled out in the agreement. Full ownership of Hulu, Chapek said, would be necessary for Disney to introduce a “hard bundle” that integrates Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Later, at the same conference, Comcast chief Brian Roberts suggested his company would be interested in buying out Disney’s 66% stake — and that an auction-style sale of Hulu in its entirety may fetch more than Disney’s implied valuation.Despite losing many top-tier titles to Peacock, Hulu will continue to offer some NBCU shows for several more years. Those include past seasons of “Law &amp; Order: SVU,” “This Is Us,” “The Mindy Project,” “30 Rock,” “Parenthood” and “Will &amp; Grace.” (The full NBCU live TV channel lineup — including NBC, E!, Bravo, USA and MSNBC — will still be available to Hulu + Live TV subscribers.)Best of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in October 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in October 202213 Supporting Actors Who Successfully Campaigned for Lead Categories at the Oscars]"

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.United Rentals and Construction Partners are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that URI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ROAD has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.URI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.61, while ROAD has a forward P/E of 66.07. We also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.49. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ROAD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.79.Another notable valuation metric for URI is its P/B ratio of 3.16. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ROAD has a P/B of 3.35.Based on these metrics and many more, URI holds a Value grade of B, while ROAD has a Value grade of C.URI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that URI is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

231,3dd04730-a7ab-3806-8d1f-add0454050fd,ORCL,2022-09-24,"After the recent decline, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Top Key Executive Lawrence Ellison's holdings have lost 6.2% of their value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-decline-oracle-corporation-nyse-110030876.html,1664017230,STORY,['ORCL'],"[If you want to know who really controls Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual insiders own the lion's share in the company with 43% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And following last week's 6.2% decline in share price, insiders suffered the most losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Oracle, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Oracle ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Oracle already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Oracle, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthOracle is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Lawrence Ellison, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 43%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of OracleThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Oracle Corporation. Insiders own US$74b worth of shares in the US$174b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Oracle. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Oracle  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are potentially serious.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$248. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, McDonald's insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders dumped US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes McDonald's Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, worth about US$172m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The McDonald's Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that McDonald's has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(Charlie Neibergall / Associated Press)Political PR and advertising firms in California are going to owe Gov. Gavin Newsom a huge favor. That's because by signing the so-called Fast Recovery Act on Sept. 5, he opened the door to what could be hundreds of millions of dollars in spending by fast-food companies to kill it.The act — formally the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act, or AB 257 — creates an appointed council that could set wage and other workplace conditions for fast-food workers.The council would be empowered to set a minimum wage as high as $22 an hour in 2023, though there is reason to doubt that wages would hit that ceiling.Fast-food corporations are looking to buy their way out of a law intended to lift pay for their workers, ensure their stores are safe and healthy and improve the industry for everybody.Mary Kay Henry, Service Employees International Union president(The state minimum wage, currently $15 an hour for employers of 26 workers or more, and $14 for smaller businesses, will rise to $15.50 for all on Jan. 1.)The restaurant industry has already taken steps to place the law before voters through a ballot measure.If the industry can collect about 623,000 valid voter signatures by the first week of December, the referendum would go on the November 2024 ballot and the law would be suspended until then. If the referendum qualifies, voters can expect McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and their ilk to spend gigantic sums to overturn the law.We've witnessed this spectacle before. It has long been evident that California's initiative and referendum system has become a playground for rich corporations.In 2020, some $205 million was spent by gig companies to pass Proposition 22, a measure designed to circumvent AB 5, the state law designating app-based drivers as well as other gig workers as employees of the parent firms, not independent contractors.The spending by Uber, Lyft and other gig companies set a national record for a ballot measure campaign, swamping the $19 million raised to defeat the measure.Story continuesFor the proponents of Proposition 22, this was money well spent.Uber's revenue came to about $17.5 billion last year and Lyft's more than $3.2 billion. Neither company has ever recorded a profit, and their paths to black ink would be even more tortuous if they had to pay their drivers a living wage along with benefits such as healthcare, retirement and workers' compensation and unemployment insurance.(Proposition 22 has been in abeyance since a state judge ruled it unconstitutional in August 2021. Its fate is now before a state appeals court.)Corporate spending on a ballot fight over the Fast Act might make those gig companies look stingy.The fast-food franchisers and franchisees have a lot more money than Uber and Lyft. McDonald's, which says it collected $23 billion at the corporate level in 2021 and its franchisees collected $102 billion, declared a corporate-level profit of $7.5 billion last year. Yum Brands, the owner of the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands, had a corporate profit of $1.58 billion and Restaurant Brands, the Canada-based parent of Burger King, $1.23 billion.Whatever one might think of the virtues or sins of AB 257, the main question confronting California voters is whether we want to place legislative power in the hands of corporations determined to write laws specifically for the benefit of their executives and shareholders, and to pass them via campaigns of unexampled dishonesty.The Proposition 22 campaign was a perfect example: The gig companies claimed their alternative to AB 5 would be a boon for their drivers and other front-line workers. As soon as Proposition 22 passed, it became crystal clear that they had lied and the workers were vastly worse off.It's a fair bet that the fast-food industry's plan to overturn the Fast Act at the ballot box will resemble the Proposition 22 campaign.Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry calls its plan ""an act of extraordinary greed and cowardice"" in which ""fast-food corporations are looking to buy their way out of a law intended to lift pay for their workers, ensure their stores are safe and healthy and improve the industry for everybody.... This isn’t how companies act when they’re proud of their business model.""The fast-food companies are sure to play on concerns of restaurant operators statewide that the Fast Act will drive costs up not only for big chains but for all dining categories. That's the fear voiced by Blair Salisbury, the owner of the Pasadena Mexican restaurant El Cholo and a member of the family that operates a half-dozen El Cholo locations across the Southland. It's not unreasonable.""If my cook is making $18 or $19 an hour,"" Salisbury told me, ""he'll go work for one of these fast-food chains that has to pay $22 an hour. Everyone's going to lose their cooks or have to raise their salaries. So it is going to affect the small mom-and-pop restaurants, not just the chains.""Salisbury recently signed a deal to open a Southern California location for the fledgling chain Daddy's Chicken Shack and line up franchisees for 19 other regional locations. But he says there's little interest in launching the chain in California, as opposed to Texas, Florida and Arizona, in part because of laws like AB 257. With inflation taking a bite out of restaurant incomes, a law posing the prospect of higher labor costs ""couldn't have come at a worse time.""Before examining the specifics of the Fast Act, let's examine the conditions that gave rise to its enactment. All told, fast-food franchisers employ more than a half-million workers in California, according to the Service Employees International Union, which sponsored AB 257.As I've reported before, the fast-food industry has long been a dark corner of the American workplace.Much of the problem stems from the franchiser-franchisee relationship, through which ""powerful global corporations like McDonald’s ... extract profits"" while pushing expenses down to smaller business owners operating franchised locations, Catherine L. Fisk and Amy W. Reavis of UC Berkeley’s law school observed in a 2021 report. “They control the prices and much of the power over quality, hours, and other operations, and the franchisee ... has no way to increase its profits other than cutting labor costs.”The result, they wrote, is that “operators fail to pay wages to which workers are entitled, deny sick leave, ignore harassment, safety hazards, or disease transmission — they are so squeezed by their franchisors that there is little incentive to comply with the law.”David Weil, a former Department of Labor official whose nomination to an agency post by President Biden was scuttled earlier this year by the franchise industry and other big business interests, documented in his 2014 book, “The Fissured Workplace,” that unpaid back wages were 50% higher at franchisee locations than at company-owned locations.The original version of AB 257 would have made the big franchise companies jointly liable for any penalties and fines levied for workplace violations at franchised locations. Labor regulators such as the National Labor Relations Board have been trying to implement such a standard for years, with only mixed success, and fast-food franchisers such as McDonald's have been fighting it for just as long.A joint-employer rule would end the big companies' ability to dodge liability for the workplace violations that are rife in the fast-food industry by hiding behind the franchisees. But it was removed from the bill as one of several changes aimed at making it more palatable for employers, and surely the most significant.Among other changes made before the measure was passed by the Legislature and signed by Newsom, the fast-food council was reduced to 10 members from 11, and restructured to give employers a larger plurality. The membership was changed from four representatives of employees and two of employers, along with five state regulators from agencies responsible for labor standards and public and occupational health; the final version encompassed four representatives of employees and four of employers, and only two regulators.The definition of fast-food employers subject to the law was changed from chains with at least 30 locations nationwide to those with 100 or more. Employee scheduling, the topic of persistent worker complaints about unpredictable working hours, was explicitly removed from the council's jurisdiction, as were benefits such as sick leave and vacation time.Instead of unlimited authority to set the minimum wage for fast-food workers, the final version capped the permissible minimum wage at $22 an hour in 2023, with increases in subsequent years of no more than the rate of inflation and in no case more than 3.5% a year, even if inflation is much higher (as it is currently).In response, the fast-food industry demonstrated that nothing would please it short of killing the measure in its entirety. Within days of Newsom's signing of the bill, the International Franchise Assn., the National Restaurant Assn. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had launched their campaign under the rubric of the Save Local Restaurants Coalition.The very name shows that the industry has read the textbooks of the gig firms, bail bond companies and others that have used AstroTurf methods to portray themselves as grass-roots avatars of the common people.""Restaurants are the heart and soul of the communities they serve,"" declared Michelle Korsmo, chief executive of the National Restaurant Assn. (Question: Does anyone really consider their street-corner McDonald's the ""heart and soul"" of their community?)Korsmo also referred to the ""unchecked governing council created by the FAST Act""; never mind that the authority of the council is specifically limited by the law, and any recommendations it makes would be subject to review by the Legislature, which would have up to nine months to approve or reject the council's proposed standards.How the law would work in practice is unclear. The fast-food council won't even exist until after a petition signed by 10,000 fast-food workers is submitted to state officials.Although the panel would have the authority to jump the minimum wage for fast-food workers up to $22 an hour in 2023, that's probably not a reasonable expectation, since worker advocates will be in the minority on the council and the members in general will be aware that as a full-time wage $22 is more than a third higher than the median income in the state and close to the median starting salary of schoolteachers. In any event, the Legislature might well reject any decision that seems that far out of the mainstream.If the fast-food companies manage to get their referendum on the 2024 ballot, California voters will get yet another lesson in how big business manipulates the initiative and referendum system for its own ends. The lesson businesses learned from the Proposition 22 campaign, and which fast-food companies are counting on, is that it's always cheaper to spend money working over the California voting public than doing right by their workers.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

242,21e626b7-20ef-33c5-b735-83b477ab2a49,PLD,2022-09-24,Huron Consulting and Toll have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huron-consulting-toll-highlighted-zacks-130101192.html,1663938061,STORY,"['HURN', 'PLD', 'TOL', 'FR', 'TRNO']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 23, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Huron Consulting Group Inc. HURN as the Bull of the Day and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Prologis, Inc. PLD, First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. FR and Terreno Realty Corp. TRNO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Huron Consulting Group Inc. is a global consulting firm that operates in an array of areas. Huron executives have set the company up for success as the U.S. and many other countries and regions around the world face economic challenges amid persistently-high inflation.HURN shares have surged in 2022 even as the market tumbles. And its highly-ranked consulting industry is poised to remain resilient during an economic downturn.Huron BasicsHuron is a consulting firm that, like every company in the field, aims to help its clients optimize their performance to run stronger, more successful businesses and organizations. Huron boasts that it’s focused on thinking outside the box and challenging the status quo, with a concentration on creating sustainable long-term change, success, efficiency, and beyond.Part of Huron’s core focus is helping clients who are attempting to figure out ways to adapt and succeed when “facing disruptive and regulatory” challenges and changes. HURN works with clients across healthcare, education, life sciences, financial services, energy, manufacturing, the public sector, and other parts of the economy.Huron is designed to help its clients “accelerate their strategic, operational, digital, and cultural transformation.” The firm’s core areas of expertise includes broader concentrations such as business operations, digital, consumer transformation, research enterprise, and more.Growth OutlookHuron posted another strong quarter at the end of July, topping our Q2 estimates. The firm has now beaten our bottom-line projections in the trailing five periods.Story continuesHuron executives also felt confident enough to boost their FY22 guidance in the face of macroeconomic unknowns as its digital transformation offerings continue to attract clients. Huron’s digital segment jumped 47% in the second quarter and 42% for the first six months of the year.Huron’s positive FY22 and FY23 earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for its revenue to jump 18% this year and another 9.4% higher in FY23 to reach $1.2 billion to outpace inflation.HURN’s bottom-line outlook is even stronger, with its adjusted earnings projected to climb 26% and 20%, respectively, to hit $3.92 per share in 2023.Other FundamentalsHuron shares have climbed roughly 28% in the past 12 months. This includes a 33% run in 2022 to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 20% downturn and the larger Zacks Business Services Sector’s 30% drop. HURN’s 95% jump in the past five years matches its Consulting Services industry.HURN shares are trading not too far off from the 52-week highs they hit in August. Plus, the current average Zacks consensus price target offers over 15% upside to the roughly $66 per share Huron trades at right now. Despite outperforming its Zacks Econ sector, Huron trades at a discount of 18.1X forward 12-month earnings vs. 22.1X. The stock is also trading at a 30% discount to its own decade-long highs and not too far off from its median. And it offers 15% value compared to its highly-ranked industry.Huron’s Consulting Services industry sits in the top 9% of over 250 Zacks industries. This is potentially crucial for investors looking to outperform the market in the fourth quarter and beyond because it’s proven that being part of a strong industry leads to better price performance.Bottom LineOn top of its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), all four of the brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Huron are “Strong Buys.” Huron also has a solid balance sheet and operates a business that should be able to hold up well during the current macro backdrop.It’s worth stressing once again how key it is to find companies that have been able to buck the market’s downtrend in 2022. And Huron’s ability to lift its guidance when most sectors outside of energy have lowered their outlooks is impressive.Bear of the Day:Toll Brothers, Inc. is one of the top luxury homebuilders in the country. Toll Brothers has been on an impressive run of revenue growth for the last 10 years, but its outlook is fading as the housing market cools on the back of soaring mortgage rates and economic downturn fears.TOL shares have tumbled off their December 2021 highs, and its earnings outlook for FY23 has plummeted since Toll Brothers reported its quarterly results on August 23. Victim of Its Own Success?Toll Brothers is a diversified luxury housing builder that operates its own architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, and land development subsidiaries, as well as other offerings that fit into its high-end offerings such as golf course development. TOL also operates its own lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing segments.TOL builds in roughly half of U.S. states and in over 60 markets from Arizona and California to New York and North Carolina. Despite being in the luxury market, Toll Brothers caters to nearly every aspect of the industry, including first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers. Toll Brothers also operates in the rental market in both urban and suburban areas.The higher-end homebuilder has posted a rather solid run of sales and earnings expansion during the last roughly 10 years and it befitted from the covid housing boom. But the once-soaring housing market is slowing as mortgage rates jump off historic lows.Mortgage rates recently climbed above 6% for the first time since 2008, up from 2.9% this time last year. The higher rates make buying homes far more expensive. Plus, the covid and low rate-boosted market saw so many people buy homes so quickly that it was due for a slowdown at some point.Fresh data out earlier this week showcased that the U.S. housing market slowed for a seventh straight month in August. This marked the longest stretch of declining sales since 2007. The higher rates and economic downturn fears are hitting the luxury housing market particularly hard.Bottom LineZacks estimates call for Toll Brothers to post another strong year of top and bottom-line expansion, with 10% sales growth expected and 41% higher adjusted earnings. The company’s FY23 sales are projected to dip 9% against these levels, with its earnings expected to slip 11%.TOL’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And Wall Street doesn’t appear ready to touch home builder stocks until there are some signs of mortgage rates leveling off or coming back down, which won’t happen until the Fed backs off.Toll Brothers could benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes. Still, it might be best for investors to stay away from TOL and other home builders for now.Additional content:Forget Rate Hikes, Bet on 3 REITs to Survive Market VolatilityAs anticipated, the Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 3.00%-3.25%. Further to tame inflation, the Fed has indicated more rate hikes ahead, with officials’ median projection for rates reaching 4.4% by the end of this year and a peak of 4.6% in 2023.However, if you believe that this latest rate hike and the projections for this year and the next have put REITs on the back foot, then you need to reconsider and focus on Prologis, Inc., First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. and Terreno Realty Corp.This is because this hybrid asset class not only provides protection against inflation but also benefits from the improving fundamentals of the underlying asset categories and the location of properties. A number of the asset categories are presently showing strength.Particularly, the industrial real estate market is still firing on all cylinders with robust demand, rents and occupancy growth. In addition to the fast adoption of e-commerce, a rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precautionary measure for any supply-chain disruption is expected to lead to long-term growth momentum for this sector, offering scope to industrial landlords.Despite economic headwinds in the second quarter, demand in the U.S. industrial market outpaced supply for the seventh straight quarter, per a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield (“CWK”). There was a net absorption of 120.4 million square feet (msf) of space in the June quarter and 236.3 msf through the first half of the year. Per the CWK report, this robust demand for industrial space is anticipated to continue, with net absorption projected to surpass 400 msf in 2022 and 250 msf in 2023.Moreover, over the past decade, not only have the REITs made their balance sheets less leveraged, they have locked in the low rates by borrowing at a fixed rate and extending the average maturity of their debt outstanding.In the second quarter of 2022, the weighted average term to maturity of REIT debt was more than seven years or 87 months. This is up from 85.5 months in the prior quarter, per a NAREIT media release. Net interest expense as a percent of net operating income (NOI) fell to a record low of 16.8% in the second quarter from 17.7% in the prior quarter. Also, leverage ratios remained low compared to the historical average.After managing their balance sheets efficiently, REITs are now well prepared for a rising rate environment. Instead of looking for debt to finance the portfolios, these companies have strategically resorted to equity capital over the past decade.Moreover, REITs provide natural protection against inflation. Particularly, rents and real estate values tend to move north with prices increasing, thereby aiding dividend growth. In fact, the majority of leases are tied with inflation, which leads to rent increases as inflation goes up. Therefore, even amid the inflationary period, investment in the REIT industry can offer a steady income stream.Finally, with the roller coaster ride in the stock market this year — thanks to high inflation and a quick rise in interest rates that is weighing on asset prices — the focus has now shifted to investing in quality companies with a consistent track of paying dividends. Obviously, this brings us to the REITs because solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT investors as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends. This has enabled the industry to stand out and gain a footing over the last 15-20 years.Stock PicksSan Francisco-based Prologis is a behemoth of the industrial REIT category. It focuses on logistics real estate in high-barrier, high-growth markets. Given its solid capacity to offer modern logistics facilities, the company is well-poised to bank on the favorable trend in the industrial real estate market.In June, Prologis announced that it will acquire Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $26 billion, including the assumption of debt. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Prologis’ current cash flow growth is projected at 49.66%, well ahead of the 9.7% growth estimated for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 9.85% compares favorably with the industry’s 3.76%, reflecting that PLD is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and boost shareholders’ wealth.Based on the dividends paid over the trailing four quarters, PLD’s dividend yield is 2.44%. Also, Prologis has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 11.29%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Prologis, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Prologis, Inc.

FR is engaged in the management, lease, acquisition, (re)development and selling of bulk and regional distribution centers, light industrial and other industrial facility types across major markets in the United States.Analysts have a bullish view on First Industrial, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share moving up to $2.20 from $2.18 over the past two months. This indicates an 11.7% increase year over year on 9.4% revenue growth to $521.1 million. FR currently has a Zacks Rank #2.First Industrial’s current cash flow growth is projected at 22.63% compared with the 9.70% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month ROE highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 13.84% compares favorably with the industry’s 3.76%, reflecting that FR is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Based on the dividends paid over the trailing four quarters, the yield is 2.43%.

Also, it is banking on its expansion efforts to capitalize on the favorable fundamentals of the industrial real estate market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 FFO per share moved north marginally over the past two months to $1.93, signaling increased confidence of analysts in the company’s solid earnings outlook. It indicates a 12.9% increase year over year on 15.4% growth in revenues.Currently, TRNO has a Zacks Rank of 2.

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your WatchlistDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.Paccar (PCAR)Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, PACCAR Inc. is a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks.

244,3e00748d-d824-3a38-b7da-dc42c1feb7dd,PCAR,2022-09-24,Should Value Investors Buy PACCAR (PCAR) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-paccar-pcar-134001829.html,1663940401,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.We also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry has an average PEG of 2.42 right now. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.23.Investors should also recognize that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.37. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 6.13. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.55, over the past year.Finally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.89. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. PCAR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 19.31. Within the past 12 months, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.21 and as low as 9.15, with a median of 10.79.These are only a few of the key metrics included in PACCAR's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth.Factors Favoring UPSWe are encouraged by UPS' free-cash flow-generating ability. UPS had generated a free cash flow of $5.1 billion even in the coronavirus-hit 2020. In 2021, the amount more than doubled to $10.9 billion. In first-half 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $6,895 million compared with $6,804 million in first-half 2021.Robust free cash-flow generation by UPS is a major positive and leads to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities. UPS paid out dividends worth $3,437 million in 2021, up 1.9% year over year. In 2021, UPS repurchased shares worth $500 million, up 130% year over year. UPS paid out dividends worth $2.6 billion in first-half 2022. It aims to reward its shareholders to the tune of $8.2 billion in 2022 through dividends ($5.2 billion) and share buybacks ($3 billion).The deal with ESW, an e-commerce company, inked in March 2022 further enhances UPS’ capabilities regarding e-commerce. This e-commerce growth is likely to bolster UPS’ top line. Even though demand for online shopping slowed down from the pandemic peak with the reopening of the economy, the figures are higher than the pre-pandemic levels.To meet the anticipated demand swell in the upcoming holiday season, UPS announced plans to add more than 100,000 seasonal workers throughout the United States. Additional workers are needed to repeat UPS’ success story witnessed last year regarding timeliness. Therefore, the decision to hire additional workers to meet the anticipated surge in package delivery demand seems prudent. Strong performance in the holiday season is likely to boost the UPS stock.UPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key RisksSupply-chain disruptions are a bane for UPS. Inflationary pressures and labor shortages are also haunting UPS. In second-quarter 2022, shipping volumes declined due to the shift in the spending pattern of consumers from goods to services. In the June quarter, consolidated average daily volumes declined 4.8% year over year.Story continuesHigh operating expenses are hurting UPS’ bottom line. Due to a 69.4% increase in fuel expenses, operating expenses increased 5.1% in first-half 2022. The metric is likely to be high in the second half too due to escalated fuel costs.High capital expenditures may also be a downside. UPS now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5.5 billion, well above the 2021 levels. The increased capex guidance, even though aimed at long-term benefits, may dent current-year profit margins.Shares of UPS have declined 10.7% in a year’s time compared with its industry’s 21.2% decrease.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are Triton International TRTN, C.H. Robinson CHRW and GATX Corporation GATXTriton is being aided by the gradual increase in trade volumes and container demand. TRTN expects container demand to remain strong throughout 2022. Measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks instill confidence in the stock.Triton has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.4% for the current year. TRTN’s bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 7.5%. TRTN currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).C.H. Robinson is being aided by an improving freight scenario in the United States. Efforts to control costs also bode well. Measures to reward its shareholders instill confidence in the stock.CHRW has a pleasant earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). The average beat is 24.2%. The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 17.3% upward over the past 60 days. C.H. Robinson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).GATX is being aided by the improving railcar demand scenario. We are also upbeat about its measures to reward its shareholders. GATX has an expected earnings growth rate of 17.6% for the current year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GATX’s current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the past 90 days.

The company’s market cap plunged by US$9.6b after price dropped by 8.4% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Stephen Squeri, sold US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$140. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.American Express insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of American ExpressFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. American Express insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$120m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At American Express Tell Us?The fact that there have been no American Express insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of American Express, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - American Express has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

With every purchase, you can use a good travel card to collect points or miles that are redeemable for flights, hotels or other travel bookings. And many travel cards come with extra benefits, too, from free entry into airport lounges to statement credits toward application fees for TSA PreCheck and other programs that expedite security screening at the airport.Take a look at our picks of the best travel rewards credit cards. If you’d rather have a card that offers cash-back rewards, see The Best Cash-Back Credit Cards.For each card (except premium travel cards), we’ve calculated a typical annual rebate based on spending patterns in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey and assuming $25,000 spent on the card annually. For cards that do not waive their annual fee the first year, we’ve subtracted the annual fee from the cash value of the annual rebate. Except where noted, these cards don’t charge a foreign-transaction fee.Best Travel Rewards Credit Cards: No Annual FeeWith these cards, reap points or miles without paying an annual fee.Chase Freedom Unlimited VisaWebsite: www.chase.com Interest rate: 0% for 15 months, then 17.24% to 25.99%Annual fee: NoneSign-up bonus: $200 back if you spend $500 in the first three months; 5% back on gas station purchases for the first $6,000 spent in the first yearTypical annual rebate: 45,277 points, worth $453Chase Freedom Unlimited is a compelling no-fee option for domestic travelers who are willing to book trips through Chase’s Ultimate Rewards program. It provides five points per dollar spent on travel purchases through Chase, three points on dining and drugstore purchases, and 1.5 points per dollar on other spending—a higher rate than the one point per dollar or 1% that most cards offer on purchases outside their maximum-rebate categories. Redeem points at a rate of a penny each for cash back, gift cards or travel. The card charges a 3% fee on foreign transactions, so for trips abroad, look to our other winners that charge no such fee.Story continuesA couple of other perks: You earn 5% cash back on Lyft rides through March 2025, and you get three months of free membership to DashPass (regularly $10 a month), which waives the delivery fee and reduces service fees on eligible orders through food-delivery service DoorDash.

251,dbedeeae-bf66-3b08-a669-d6d4d30473bf,MDLZ,2022-09-24,"An Intrinsic Calculation For Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Suggests It's 44% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-mondelez-international-inc-140022009.html,1663941622,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Does the September share price for Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.90bUS$4.31bUS$4.74bUS$5.03bUS$5.25bUS$5.45bUS$5.62bUS$5.78bUS$5.92bUS$6.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 4.43%Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.16%Est @ 2.8%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% US$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.1b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$182bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$182b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$108bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$147b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$59.8, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Chazen, who early in his career was a finance executive, acquired shale properties and pledged to put cash flow above production.Magnolia, which disclosed his death on Friday, had said two days earlier Chazen was stepping down as chairman and CEO due to ""serious health reasons.""He had a lengthy career at Occidental, which he joined in 1994 and climbed through its finance ranks to become CEO. He helped advance the career of Occidental's current CEO, Vicki Hollub. Chazen rejoined Occidental as a director in 2019.""Steve played a significant role in transforming Oxy into a focused global energy leader over the past 30 years, serving as chief financial officer, CEO and most recently as independent board chairman,"" Hollub said in a statement.""He was the type of businessman who didn’t follow trends, but rather established trends,"" said Christopher Stavos, who took over this week as Magnolia CEO. ""Steve had a profound impact on how E&amp;P companies are managed with an objective of creating long-lasting shareholder value.""Magnolia was started in 2017 as a ""blank check"" company by investors betting on Chazen's reputation and track record. Chazen used the investors' money to acquire shale oil and gas properties in South Texas's Eagle Ford shale region.He built the company to focus on generating cash in excess of capital investment and for modest production growth. That formula - strong cash flow from single-digit volume growth - was uncommon at the time but is now widely adopted by other U.S. shale oil producers.Story continuesChazen was ""the single most important oil man of his generation,"" said Paul Sankey, a long-time oil equity analyst, who said Chazen combined ""unwavering clarity of viewpoint, iconoclasm, and enormous humour.""Hollub said, ""We cared for him deeply and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, family and friends.""Plans for a memorial service were not immediately available.(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Frances Kerry)]"

With every purchase, you can use a good travel card to collect points or miles that are redeemable for flights, hotels or other travel bookings. And many travel cards come with extra benefits, too, from free entry into airport lounges to statement credits toward application fees for TSA PreCheck and other programs that expedite security screening at the airport.Take a look at our picks of the best travel rewards credit cards. If you’d rather have a card that offers cash-back rewards, see The Best Cash-Back Credit Cards.For each card (except premium travel cards), we’ve calculated a typical annual rebate based on spending patterns in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey and assuming $25,000 spent on the card annually. For cards that do not waive their annual fee the first year, we’ve subtracted the annual fee from the cash value of the annual rebate. Except where noted, these cards don’t charge a foreign-transaction fee.Best Travel Rewards Credit Cards: No Annual FeeWith these cards, reap points or miles without paying an annual fee.Chase Freedom Unlimited VisaWebsite: www.chase.com Interest rate: 0% for 15 months, then 17.24% to 25.99%Annual fee: NoneSign-up bonus: $200 back if you spend $500 in the first three months; 5% back on gas station purchases for the first $6,000 spent in the first yearTypical annual rebate: 45,277 points, worth $453Chase Freedom Unlimited is a compelling no-fee option for domestic travelers who are willing to book trips through Chase’s Ultimate Rewards program. It provides five points per dollar spent on travel purchases through Chase, three points on dining and drugstore purchases, and 1.5 points per dollar on other spending—a higher rate than the one point per dollar or 1% that most cards offer on purchases outside their maximum-rebate categories. Redeem points at a rate of a penny each for cash back, gift cards or travel. The card charges a 3% fee on foreign transactions, so for trips abroad, look to our other winners that charge no such fee.Story continuesA couple of other perks: You earn 5% cash back on Lyft rides through March 2025, and you get three months of free membership to DashPass (regularly $10 a month), which waives the delivery fee and reduces service fees on eligible orders through food-delivery service DoorDash.

After all, the Nasdaq Composite has sustained a loss of 27% since the start of the year, far wider than the other two major indices. Nevertheless, daring contrarians should consider the compelling discounts on tap.For one thing, not all Nasdaq stocks to buy are levered to the tech sector. Indeed, investors will find incredible diversity in the exchange that presents viable prospects should a market crash materialize.As well, the equities sector operates in cycles. We got through an extraordinarily bullish cycle, so it must be corrected with a bearish one. That’s not unusual, nor should it necessarily be something to be feared. Therefore, the Nasdaq stocks to buy on the dip represents a way to take control of an otherwise dour-looking situation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$168.14AAPLApple$157.32DLTRDollar Tree$141.31ULTAUlta Beauty$418.69AMZNAmazon$123.97UPWKUpwork$15.44RICKRCI Hospitality$69.66PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comArguably one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy following a market implosion, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) specializes in soft drinks. Given the addictive quality of the underlying products, PEP really could be a no-brainer during times of trouble. Essentially, people seek a respite from various troubles and PepsiCo can help address them, though in a cynical fashion.According to a report from CNN, soft drink manufacturers enjoy a captive audience framework. “The more soda you drink, the bigger the ‘reward,’ and as would happen with most pleasurable things, we develop an affinity and want even more of them,” said Cordialis Msora-Kasago, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Further, even the diet variety of popular soda brands feature their own addictive qualities. During a market downturn, people will turn to stimuli, and caffeine and sugar represent popular ones. Therefore, PEP is an easy name to consider for Nasdaq stocks to buy.Story continuesApple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comUnder normal circumstances, economic pressures – particularly those impacting consumer sentiment – should hurt Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And technically, the circumstances that erupted this year imposed significantly negative results for AAPL stock. For instance, it has slipped more than 13% on a year-to-date basis. Still, those seeking Nasdaq stocks to buy following a market meltdown should look closely at AAPL.Despite myriad reasons to avoid discretionary purchases as much as possible, it appears that logic doesn’t apply to Apple devices. Upon launching its latest gizmos and gadgets, preorder demand encouraged observing analysts. Given these products are hardly what you would call cheap, the robust interest in forking over hard-earned dollars presents many possibilities for the consumer technology giant.Essentially, even if other discretionary businesses fail, Apple commands a social cachet that refuses to fade. While I wouldn’t throw everything into AAPL right now, it makes for an intriguing position to build up over time. Therefore, it’s one of the Nasdaq stocks to buy for patient investors.Dollar Tree (DLTR)store front of a Dollar Tree location with green signageSource: shutterstock.com/Jonathan WeissAs a discount retailer, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) deserves significant attention among Nasdaq stocks to buy. Currently, the economic topic of the day, week, month and year is inflation. Specifically, when the money supply rises, the subsequent purchasing power of dollars in consumers’ hands declines. Obviously, this is basic Economics 101 – supply and demand.However, what’s incredibly problematic about inflation is that it impacts modest income earners disproportionately. Indeed, the less money someone makes, the likelier it is that inflation imposes greater pain on them. Of course, the Federal Reserve understands this point. But if it fails to engineer a soft landing and instead facilitates a rough one, plenty of people can fall out of the upper income thresholds.No one wants to see this circumstance materialize. However, if it does happen, you’ll want to consider DLTR as one of the Nasdaq stocks to buy.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comDeeply contrarian, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) could very well be one of those 5,000-IQ market plays if you’re specifically seeking Nasdaq stocks to buy. While the underlying index suffered a loss of nearly 28% YTD, during the same period, ULTA is up 1.3%. True, by absolute standards, gaining 1.3% for the year hardly rates as exciting territory. But again, the major equity indices presently swim (or drown) in red ink.That ULTA stock rides against the tide presents a worthy case for Nasdaq stocks to buy in and of itself. Still, it begs the question: why is Ulta doing so well (relatively speaking) when other businesses floundered? It may boil down to relevance of the underlying industry.Currently, one of the debates in the domestic economy focuses on the return-to-the-office battle. In short, workers want to stay home, but upper management wants them physically back in their posts. Because enterprises sign the checks, they make the rules. Therefore, a possible full return to normal could inspire concerns about looking presentable in the workplace, thus boding well for ULTA.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comArguably, the red ink Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeing may be cathartic to many, if not most people. In several ways, Amazon represented an economic vacuum cleaner, sucking away opportunities from mom-and-pop stores. By killing the diverse small-business ecosystem, the e-commerce giant effectively became the Hollywood epitome of every corporate bad guy. Therefore, I suspect few tears exist for Amazon’s woes.At the same time, for investors willing to set aside their emotions, AMZN could be one of the better ideas for Nasdaq stocks to buy during a market meltdown. True, the underlying firm suffers from myriad controversies. Nevertheless, replacing such a dynamic and dominant firm will be difficult. Politically, I’m not sure it makes sense to dismantle or otherwise stymie Amazon considering rising competition in the global economy.Further, Amazon plays into several relevant industries. It’s not just e-commerce, which clearly is massive. Rather, the company delves into other segments, such as cloud computing and even streaming content. Therefore, AMZN is one of the long-haul Nasdaq stocks to buy.Upwork (UPWK)The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.Source: Funstock / Shutterstock.comLet’s be honest. You don’t need to wait for an equities sector implosion to get a discount on freelancer marketplace Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK). Hemorrhaging 54% of market value, you can acquire shares right now and feel good about the purchase. Of course, you don’t want to haphazardly buy Nasdaq stocks just because they printed crimson ink. That’s a surefire way of eventually suffering catastrophic losses.However, with Upwork, the freelancer platform fortuitously provides immense relevance. The reality is that people are not as honest as you might think they are. In fact, publications exist that help employers combat potential work-from-home abuses.Therefore, with this massive debate about the return to office culminating in a head-on collision, at least some folks will pivot to the gig economy. That should be music to Upwork’s ears, making UPWK one of the best Nasdaq stocks to buy.RCI Hospitality (RICK)restaurant stocks: wine glasses, cutlery and plates on a long tableSource: ShutterstockEasily one of the most controversial Nasdaq stocks in any context, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) is a special business. It caters to an audience that predominantly identifies as male with nightclubs, restaurants and other adult enterprises.From a moral perspective, many investors might question including RICK stock on this list of Nasdaq stocks to buy. Fundamentally, morals shift and overlap between person to person, so it’s not something I can judge. But from an investment perspective, RICK absolutely deserves attention from market participants because of its track record.According to CNBC, following the wake of the Great Recession, this industry boomed during the troubles. Essentially, RCI caters to a similar narrative bolstering PepsiCo. People want a distraction during rough times, and they crave dopamine. That’s what RCI provides, and it could be due for a repeat performance should a recession occur again.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has provided the award.Details of the DealValued at $20.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2023. Per the terms, Boeing will offer logistics management, product support analysis and integration, maintenance planning, technical data, support equipment maintenance, and engineering services to support the P-8A aircraft.The contract will cater to the U.S. Navy and the governments of Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom. The majority portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in Jacksonville, FL, Whidbey Island, WA and Sigonella, Italy.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing,  one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing,  the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 20.8% in the past year.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

Roughly $1 out of every $5 of venture capital funding went to a fintech startup. Clearly, many large investors were enthusiastic about fintech firms. For those who also want to get on this bandwagon, I will present seven fintech stocks to buy for royal returns.However, macroeconomic challenges and a looming recession have restrained fintech stocks through the first nine months of 2022. Specifically, the KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index has lost 27.5% so far this year.  By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index has declined 18.7%.Yet the sharp retreat of fintech shares has made the valuation of many of these names more attractive, creating compelling buying opportunities for growth investors. Moreover, the long-term outlook of the fintech space still appears to be attractive. That’s because of the continued rise of e-commerce and the growing adoption of mobile payments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, here are the seven fintech stocks that could generate long-term returns.BILLBill.com$142.06FISVFiserv$102.17FINXGlobal X FinTech ETF$22.16INTUIntuit$417.82MELIMercado Libre$905.69PYPLPayPal$91.63PATHUiPath$13.79Bill.com (BILL)A concept image of mobile payment with a smart phone for a cup of coffee.Source: ShutterstockPayment processing platform Bill.com (NYSE:BILL) offers cloud-based financial solutions for small- and mid-sized companies.

Its revenue jumped 156% year-over-year to $200.2 million. Investors were also pleased by the significant YOY decline in its loss per share, excluding some items, and by the meaningful growth of its total payment volume.Meanwhile, Bill.com is focused on growing its operations, as it acquired the accounts receivable software provider Invoice2go and the budgeting and expense management tool Divvy. For fiscal 2023, Bill.com anticipates that its revenue will rise around 50%, an increase that investors would view favorably.Story continuesBILL stock has fallen 43% in 2022.

The shares are trading at 14 times Fiserv’s forward earnings and four times its sales. Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for Fiserv stock is $127.

""I wanted to stop being scared and just do it, but I'd heard good and bad things about owning a home,"" she says. ""I'm a single mom of three, and I thought it would be a lot to handle.""However, the frustration of living in the two-bedroom apartment that she currently rents with her children: Robert, 10; Elijah, 7; and Ilionna, 3 continued to grow. Her neighbors play loud music and the apartment managers either refuse to fix things, or take a long time for repairs and maintenance. Her children often want to go outside and play in the grass or sit on the porch safely ""without someone being in their space,"" she said. ""They don't like it.""One day while at her job, Christina was intrigued by a flyer she saw about Habitat for Humanity of St. Joseph County, Indiana's homeownership program. A co-worker who was already in the program strongly encouraged her to apply. She did, and Christina was approved.The family is close to moving in to their new home. Their house is being built as part of Habitat for Humanity's BuildBetter with Whirlpool, an expansion of Habitat's existing BuildBetter initiative that will build more than 250 climate-resilient and energy-efficient homes over the next three years in partnership with hundreds of families in need of affordable housing.Christina's new three-bedroom home has a 95 percent-efficient furnace, a high-efficiency gas water heater, resilient flooring throughout, all LED lighting, low-flow WaterSense Bath faucets and toilets, and energy-efficient windows. The family also received an energy-efficient refrigerator and range, which are donated by Whirlpool Corp. to every Habitat-built home in North America.Having her own home means two things to Christina: independence and an opportunity for her kids to enjoy their lives.

273,5f779245-5662-399c-8311-52195e4bded7,SRE,2022-09-24,4 Gas Distribution Stocks to Watch in a Promising Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-gas-distribution-stocks-watch-122012984.html,1663935612,STORY,"['SRE', 'ATO', '^GSPC', 'NJR', 'NFG']","[The production of natural gas in the United States is likely to increase year over year in 2022 per the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) and continue driving stocks in the Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry. The distribution companies offer services to transport natural gas from the region of production to millions of consumers across the United States.Sempra Energy SRE, with its widespread natural gas infrastructure and systematic investments in infrastructure development projects, is poised to benefit as natural gas production volumes are expected to increase in the 2022-2023 time period. Steady investments and expanding infrastructure in key production regions should drive the performance of Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, National Fuel Gas Company NFG and NewJersey Resources Corporation NJR.About the IndustryThe shale revolution has substantially increased natural gas production. Its clean-burning nature is steadily boosting demand for natural gas in the electric power, industrial, commercial and residential markets. Natural Gas distribution pipelines play a vital role in delivering natural gas from intrastate and interstate transmission pipelines to consumers through small-diameter pipelines. The natural gas network in the United States has nearly 3 million miles of pipeline that ensures a steady supply to millions of customers. The concerns for the distribution industry are aging infrastructure and increasing investment costs required to upgrade and maintain the vast network of pipelines due to the hike in interest rates. In addition, competition from other clean sources of energy can lower the demand for natural gas, consequently pushing down demand for pipelines.Factors Shaping the Future of the Gas Distribution IndustryProduction and Export Volumes of Gas to Increase: The short-term energy outlook released by the EIA indicates that domestic dry natural gas production will grow 3.8% year over year to 97.09 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2022 and 3.4% year over year to 100.36 Bcf/d in 2023. EIA also expects U.S. natural gas consumption to increase 4.33% in 2022 to 86.56 Bcf/d due to higher consumption from all customer groups, while 2023 consumption is expected to drop by 2.2% to 84.63 Bcf/d due to the expectation of milder winter temperature and lower consumption from the residential and commercial customer group. EIA expects U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export volumes to increase 12.8% year over year to 11.01 Bcf/d in 2022. EIA expects LNG export volumes to increase 12.1% to 12.34 Bcf/d in 2023. The higher production and export volumes will definitely increase the usage and demand for natural gas pipelines in the United States.Aging Distribution Infrastructure: The existing U.S. natural gas distribution pipelines are aging. Leakage or breakage in these old cast iron and bare steel pipelines may result in disruption of services. At present, natural gas distribution utilities provide services to over 75 million residential and 5 million commercial customers in the United States. Per a report from Business Roundtable, replacing the old pipelines will cost around $270 billion. To lower the possibility of interruption in services, the Department of Energy announced $33 million funding for 10 projects involved in natural gas pipeline retrofitting to rehabilitate existing old cast iron and bare steel pipes.  The Rapid Encapsulation of Pipelines Avoiding Intensive Replacement or the REPAIR program will ensure the minimum extension of the service life of distribution pipelines by 50 years and lower the replacement cost of old pipelines by nearly 10 to 20 times per mile. At present, pipe excavation and replacement costs can go up to $10 million per mile. The rising interest rates will increase the overall project financing cost for the utilities compared with what these companies have enjoyed in the past two years.Scope for Fresh Investments: The clean-burning nature and wide availability across the United States are driving the demand for natural gas. The distribution network should continue to play a major role in transporting natural gas to nearly 75 million customers in all parts of the United States. The demand from the rising natural gas customer volume and usage of natural gas to produce electricity will play a pivotal role in the utilities’ gradual transition toward clean energy. With LNG export volumes rising each year and three new LNG export terminals are being developed in the United States, which will increase demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals. Per EIA, once completed, the three new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 5.7 Bcf/d by 2025. As production and demand for natural gas are increasing, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the natural gas to end-users,  which will create new growth opportunities for natural gas pipeline operators.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects.The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry — a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector — currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #159, which places it in the top 22% of the 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$64.55). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 75.54k shares worth US$5.7m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned -12.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has lost 9.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $8.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +604.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +883.6%. This estimate has changed +5.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.85 indicates a change of -35.5% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $42.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +42.7%. The $173.97 billion and $157.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +52.6% and -9.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $51.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +86.1%. EPS of $11.36 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +27.09%. The EPS surprise was +17.11%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy.

UNH, McKesson Corp. MCK, and AstraZeneca PLC AZN – have displayed a substantial amount of relative strength year-to-date, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.UnitedHealth Group Inc.UnitedHealth provides a wide range of health care products and services, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.UNH has shown a commendable commitment to its shareholders – UnitedHealth has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of a substantial 17.6%.The company’s 1.3% annual yield is just slightly lower than its Zacks Sector average of 1.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company knows how to generate serious cash – UNH’s free cash flow came in at a sizable $6.2 billion in its latest quarter, penciling in a double-digit 30% sequential increase and a 25% Y/Y uptick.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTo top it off, UnitedHealth carries a notably strong growth profile – earnings are forecasted to soar 15% in FY22 and an additional 13% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcKesson Corp. McKesson Corp. is a healthcare services and information technology company operating through two segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions.MCK’s near-term earnings outlook has turned notably bright over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company carries favorable valuation characteristics, further bolstered by its Value Style Score of an A.McKesson’s forward earnings multiple sits at 14.2X, representing an enticing 31% discount relative to its Zacks Medical Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike UNH, McKesson’s growth profile is notable; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for the company’s current fiscal year (FY23) resides at $24.42, penciling in Y/Y bottom line growth of more than 3%.And in FY24, earnings are forecasted to climb a further 7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAstraZeneca PLCAstraZeneca is one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. Its business can be broken down into separate lines based on therapeutic classes, including cardiovascular, respiratory, immunology, oncology, rare diseases, and others. For those seeking an income stream, AstraZeneca has that covered; the company’s annual dividend yields 1.6%, paired with a sizable 6.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Undoubtedly a positive, the company has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAZN currently carries a 17.1X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath its 22.3X five-year median and reflecting a sizable 17% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Further, AstraZeneca carries a Style Score of a B for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerhaps the biggest highlight of all is the company’s forecasted growth – for AZN’s current fiscal year (FY22), the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $3.31 pencils in a stellar 25% Y/Y uptick in earnings.And in FY23, the company’s bottom line looks to expand a further double-digit 11.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWhile the market’s price action has undoubtedly been disheartening in 2022, some stocks are still weathering the storm better than most.All three stocks above have widely outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2022, telling us that market participants have defended shares at a much higher level than others.For investors searching for stocks displaying relative strength in 2022 paired with a strong growth roadmap, UnitedHealth Group Inc.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Quickly Is UnitedHealth Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, UnitedHealth Group has grown EPS by 13% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. EBIT margins for UnitedHealth Group remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$307b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for UnitedHealth Group.Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$484b company like UnitedHealth Group. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.6b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does UnitedHealth Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of UnitedHealth Group is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group  that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has lost 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.45 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.86 points to a change of +14.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.74 indicates a change of +13.2% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $80.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $322.21 billion and $347.75 billion estimates indicate +12% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%.

287,755c1587-a652-384d-a8b7-8f948b414c44,DHI,2022-09-24,Should Value Investors Pick D.R. Horton (DHI) Stock Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-pick-d-r-133501243.html,1663940101,STORY,"['DHI', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, D.R. Horton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 4.56, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.45. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, D.R. Horton’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares slightly favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 4.60. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is marginally undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesWe should also point out that D.R. Horton has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 4.18, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for D.R. Horton stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, D.R. Horton has a P/S ratio of about 0.78. This is lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.49 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, DHI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, D.R. Horton currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes D.R. Horton a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though D.R. Horton might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F. This gives DHI a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have not been very encouraging. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen two upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1.7% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched lower by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and ConsensusD.R. Horton, Inc. Price and ConsensusD.R. Horton, Inc. price-consensus-chart | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineD.R. Horton is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 8%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

289,48a62f9b-3e10-364e-8bcf-db8c7250b997,ETN,2022-09-24,Eaton (ETN) is a Top Dividend Stock Right Now: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-etn-top-dividend-stock-154503001.html,1663947903,STORY,['ETN'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Eaton in FocusBased in Dublin, Eaton (ETN) is in the Industrial Products sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -21.81%. The power management company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.81 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.4%. This compares to the Manufacturing - Electronics industry's yield of 1% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.24 is up 6.6% from last year. Eaton has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.57%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Eaton's current payout ratio is 47%. This means it paid out 47% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for ETN for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $7.55 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 14.05%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that ETN is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.72% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.01%.Heading into today, shares of the food and beverage company had lost 5.95% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 6.32% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.09% in that time.PepsiCo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 12, 2022. On that day, PepsiCo is projected to report earnings of $1.84 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 2.79%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $20.83 billion, up 3.18% from the prior-year quarter.PEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.66 per share and revenue of $83.92 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.39% and +5.6%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher within the past month. PepsiCo is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking at its valuation, PepsiCo is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 25.32. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 24.05.Story continuesMeanwhile, PEP's PEG ratio is currently 3.3.

Some Wall Street analysts believe this might be a hint at Apple’s next big sports play.“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is another sign that Cupertino will be aggressive on this live sports ambitions as we believe this is the drumroll to winning the DirectTV package vs Amazon,” Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance in an email.Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre perform during halftime of Super Bowl LVI between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals, Feb. 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium. (Kareem Elgazzar-USA TODAY Sports)Ives has indicated in the past that Apple is “in the winner’s circle” for the NFL’s Sunday Ticket streaming package that provides fans access to every NFL game. That deal is believed to be worth more than $2 billion annually and one of the main moves Apple is expected to make as it dives further into live sports.But just sponsoring the halftime show alone will also have residual benefits for Apple. Pepsi (PEP) had previously sponsored the halftime show for the last 10 years. The company didn't re-sign the sponsorship amid reports that the NFL placed a $50 million annual price tag on the event.The sponsorship is valued so high because it’s become increasingly integrated into the Super Bowl broadcast, which was viewed by more than 120 million people last year. Since announcers are required to call the hyped halftime show by its full name “The Pepsi Halftime Show,” Pepsi was the most mentioned brand on the broadcast, according to analysis from Elevate Sports Ventures and Hive Enterprise A.I.The broadcast mentioned Pepsi 11 times, nearly doubling the next closest company, Toyota (TM). Pepsi finished fourth in cumulative screen time during last year’s Super Bowl, with the halftime show driving the majority of its nearly four minutes of on-screen exposure.“When you can put those two things together the way that broadcast partners do, with having a mention to something like the Pepsi Halftime Show, as well as that signage, [it] just creates that drumbeat of awareness for a brand,” HIVE Enterprise A.I.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and Blackstone Inc. (BX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Union Pacific shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (+2.6% vs. -2.1%). UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The company hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%.The uptick in overall volumes as labor woes ease is an added positive. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. Management expects share repurchases in 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels.However, escalation in fuel costs as oil prices move north is worrisome. This phenomenon induced a 20% rise in the operating expenses during first-half 2022. Fuel costs surged 82% in the period. Fuel costs are likely to be high in the September quarter as well. Results will be out on Oct 20. High capital expenditures may also be a downside.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AT&amp;T’s shares have declined -41.7% over the past year against Verizon's -27.8% decline and -16.8% pullback in the S&amp;P 500 index. The company is struggling with a steady decline in its legacy telephony Internet and wireline services. High-speed Internet revenues are also contracting due to a decline in the legacy digital subscriber line. With the divesture of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T must build upon its core businesses to improve its value proposition as spectrum crisis and cord-cutting remain challenges.However, AT&amp;T is witnessing solid subscriber momentum. A customer-centric business model, is providing the company with healthy growth in its postpaid wireless business alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans.The company is actively investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjusting its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth. While optimizing operations, it is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Blackstone’s shares have declined -33.3% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of -27.2%. The company’s elevated operating expenses are expected to hurt the company's bottom line in the near term. Our estimates for total expenses (GAAP) suggest a CAGR of almost 17% over the next three years.Additionally, lower chance of sustainability of its capital deployment activities (given the volatile nature of its earnings) remains another major near-term concern and hence makes us apprehensive. However, Blackstone remains well-poised to benefit from its strong fund-raising ability, revenue mix and global footprint.The buyout of DCI is expected to further enhance its digital capabilities. Additionally, continued net inflows are expected to support Blackstone's assets under management (AUM) growth, going forward. Our estimates for total AUM indicate a rise of 8.5% for 2022.(You can read the full research report on Blackstone here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Southern Company (SO), Gilead Sciences, Inc.

A highly leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Pioneer Natural (PXD) Banks On Oil-Rich Permian Basin AssetsThe Zacks analyst believes that Pioneer Natural's one-million-plus high-quality acreages in the Permian Basin will drive long-term oil production growth. Yet, rising production costs are concerning.Improving Fees and Commissions Aid Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG)Per the Zacks analyst, Arthur J. Gallagher is poised to grow on improving fees and commissions that in turn is driving organic revenues growth. However, rising expenses weighing on margin concerns.Competitor's Product Recall Aids ResMed (RMD), Mask Sales UpThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about a voluntary recall of CPAP and ventilator devices by ResMed's competitor leading to a demand shift toward ResMed products. Mask sales climb on patient flow recovery.Expansion Efforts to Aid Restaurant Brands (QSR), Costs HighPer the Zacks analyst, Restaurant Brands is likely to benefit from unit expansion efforts, menu innovation and loyalty program. However, a rise in labor and commodity costs is a concern.New UpgradesCadence (CDNS) Benefits from Product Portfolio &amp; AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, Cadence's performance is gaining from robust demand for the company's diversified product portfolio. Synergies from recent acquisitions also bode well.Capacity Expansion, Cost Reduction to Aid Albemarle (ALB)According to the Zacks analyst, Albemarle should gain from its actions to boost its global lithium derivative capacity.

300,2cd89ab2-7d7b-3cb5-8c1f-8056e307ff77,CSCO,2022-09-24,More Than Two Million Women Rock-IT,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-two-million-women-rock-130000445.html,1663938000,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 23, 2022 / Cisco Systems Inc. In the 25 years since it was founded, inclusiveness has been at the core of Cisco Networking Academy. Networking Academy's global reach is amazing, with students in 190 countries and nearly 12 thousand academies offering over 30 courses in up to 27 languages. But making the program available is only half the challenge: making the demand inclusive is another matter. This is why, in 2014, we introduced the Women Rock-IT initiative.Cisco Systems Inc., Friday, September 23, 2022, Press release pictureThe World Economic Forum predicts that it will take another 136 years to close the global gender gap, this number is greatly impacted by the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data differs by country, but women globally are generally underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education and employment. Deloitte Global found that large global technology firms will reach female representation in their workforces of nearly 33 percent in 2022, up slightly more than 2 percentage points from 2019. The Deloitte report acknowledges that ""tech companies may need to work even harder to improve these numbers"" to recruit, hire, retrain and promote women, especially in technical roles.Women Rock-IT was conceived to show young women that there are exciting careers for women in tech, across all industries, and to highlight inspiring and successful women who are innovating with tech and serving as great role models.I'm thrilled to report that since our first Women Rock-IT event, the initiative has seen more than two million participants, and 870,000 course enrollments.Streaming over social media channels, attendees view live presentations and can take free introductory tech courses to earn digital badges and entry certification-aligned courses offered through Networking Academy, such as: Introduction to IoT, Introduction to Cybersecurity, Entrepreneurship, Linux, Python, and Networking Essentials.Story continuesThe importance of seeing successful women present at Women Rock-IT cannot be overstated, but was maybe best summed up by Chaylee Reeve, a university student majoring in Space Engineering in Australia: ""It's the power of seeing other women succeed. There's nothing that can replace that.""And Women Rock-IT doesn't only inspire, it can change lives. Agnes Chege was laid off from her customer service job at an electronics company in Nairobi, Kenya early in the pandemic. After joining a Women Rock-IT virtual event, Agnes was inspired to take a free Introduction to Cybersecurity course from Cisco Networking Academy. Before long she was approached by a cybersecurity company, offered an internship, and now works as a Level 1 Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst.""Honestly, if Cisco Networking Academy didn't exist I wouldn't be in cybersecurity right now. I had very little knowledge of it before I took the Introduction to Cybersecurity course,"" says Agnes.Agnes is now also actively involved in cybersecurity user awareness training to different clients and has taken her passion to see more girls join the field a notch higher by involving herself in mentorship programs for girls in high schools. She is also taking a free Python Essentials course on Skills for All to improve her programming skills.Women Rock-IT is an ongoing program. Breaking down the barriers to women's success in tech is an ongoing challenge, but there are signs of improvement. We started from a low base, and that gives me hope - the more women who pursue STEAM courses and progress into tech jobs, the more role models there are for young women to be inspired to study STEAM subjects, like Agnes.Who doesn't like a virtuous cycle?View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717179/More-Than-Two-Million-Women-Rock-IT]"
