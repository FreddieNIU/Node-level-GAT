Welcome to the Schwab 2024 Winter Business Update. This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I hope everyone is still on track for their respective resolutions. While it is the New Year, we are joined by the same Venable panel of presenters, our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster, and CFO, Peter Crawford. Obviously, a bit of a different structure to Winter Business Update this time around to be 100% virtual, but you'll still get the same in-depth perspectives from the team regarding client trends and behavior, continued progress on strategic initiatives, and the tremendous opportunity we see on the horizon.

And certainly, last but not least, the forward-looking statements page reminding us all that the future is uncertain, so please stay up-to-date with our disclosures. And with that, Walt."", ""Walt Bettinger: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our January Business Update. We're here in Frigid Westlake, Texas, where I think it was 15 degrees when I hopped in the vehicle this morning to come to the office. But Happy New Year and again, thank you all for joining us. So as we close the book on 2023 and begin thinking about 2024, it seems like a natural time to reflect on the year that just closed. It was certainly a challenging year for our clients, for our stockholders, and for us. Perhaps it was the most challenging in my time at Schwab, certainly the most challenging since the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000. And yet at the same time, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities before us."", ""In 2024, you're going to see an emphasis on execution, but with consistency around our strong client fundamentals and strategy. I recognize that 2024 is going to be a transition year from a financial standpoint, albeit one with steadily improving financial results throughout the year and a very strong exit into 2025. It's unrealistic to think that the challenges of 2023 simply disappear, because the calendar flips over. But when I look ahead to 2025, 2026, and 2027, I'm quite confident that the power of our client franchise is going to shine in terms of financial results. There's much work to do in 2024 and beyond, and no one at Schwab is kidding themselves that everything is perfect right now. But my confidence is high. I'm incredibly encouraged by what I see, whether it's our positioning, our client relationships, the solutions that we offer our clients, or the focus of the entire organization on the future."", ""If I could take you back in time to the mid-2000s, that was a period when Chuck first began speaking with me about the possibility of becoming CEO someday. And as a result of those discussions, I went on a listening tour of former very Senior Executives of Schwab. My goal is simply to ask them their views on the firm and our prospects for the future. It's important to keep in mind that many of them had been let go or terminated in the turmoil that followed the Internet bubble bursting. They had experienced this incredible run-up in the value of the firm, followed by the pain of multiple rounds of employee layoffs and a stock price that had collapsed from the ‘50s to mere single digits. And although each of them used different words, they all basically said the same thing they were fearful that Schwab Best Days were in the past."", ""I tried to absorb their counsel and their feedback objectively, of course, I was balancing the personal challenges that they had each been through as I listen to their feedback. But I fundamentally did not believe that the firm's best days were in the past. There were far too many strengths for me to believe that. And over a few years, with a lot of hard work by many people, I believe it's pretty clear that we proved them wrong. As our stock price grew over ten-fold and assets, the clients entrusted us with grew similarly. I understand that today there are some who might be asking similar questions, but I am confident that our Best Days are ahead of us. In my opinion, after four decades in this business, there is no firm better positioned for the future."", ""No firm has our breadth of client solutions, investing, trading, custody, advisory workplace. And all delivered with an incredible value for investors and advisors. I expect us to make steady progress in both client flows and financial performance throughout this upcoming year, and then I fully expect us to deliver outstanding results over the following years. So let's go ahead and dig in to 2023. It was a year of many twists and turns for our investor clients as well as for our stockholders. And all the while we made substantial progress on the largest acquisition related conversion in the history of our industry. Coming on off a difficult 2022 for investors, the first quarter of 2023 began with turmoil in the regional banking world. Investor sentiment bounced between negative and positive throughout the year before eventually ending quite positive."", 'Equity returns were strong in 2023, although largely concentrated in a modest number of stocks. For Schwab stockholders, it was a difficult year. Our stock lost about 17% of its value. The core reasoning behind most of this decline is our commitment to proactively following our through-client size strategy. Because throughout 2022 and 2023, we reached out to our clients and encouraged them to move their yield-sensitive, or what we sometimes refer to as longer-term investment cash, into higher-yielding alternatives. And they did, to the tune of several $100 billion. And an and aside although these actions have temporally impacted our revenue and earnings, we would do the same thing every time. The client loyalty that we build by being proactive will pay dividends in the long-term as clients continue to entrust us with their investment dollars.', ""Progress on the Ameritrade conversion was exceptional with about 90% of the client accounts and assets all accurately and successfully converted. And despite the substantial focus on this effort, we continue to make real progress on other client-related initiatives that help set the table for future organic growth. Let's go ahead on this slide and take a deeper look into 2023 from the lens of our investor clients. The open market committee of the federal reserve continued to recover from the mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint they raised rates multiple times in 2023 before peaking at close to 5.5%, as inflation began to ease directionally toward the Fed's long-term goal of 2%. And although equity markets continue to be volatile, ultimate returns were actually quite strong, with the S&P 500 rising over 20% and the NASDAQ composites increasing over 40%."", 'Investor sentiment was also volatile throughout 2023. It recovered rather dramatically in the fourth quarter of the year from a strong bear sentiment in the third quarter and ended the year with a solid bullish viewpoint. But despite this mixed sentiment, our clients remained highly engaged with the markets and with Schwab. Clients were net purchasers of equities last year by a 1.2 to 1 ratio, and although trading activity was about 10% lower than in 2022, it was still much higher than pre-pandemic levels. And net flows into our retail advisory solutions were a very strong $33 billion. Last year was a solid year in terms of client flows for our firm, particularly given the volatility of the markets and the negative sentiment that existed throughout much of the year.', ""Core net new assets were slightly above $300 billion, and core net new assets from clients who originally opened their accounts with Schwab were about $30 billion higher. The difference, of course, reflecting the attrition from certain former Ameritrade clients. Now in terms of the Ameritrade conversion, we've converted approximately 90% of the accounts and assets, that totals about $1.6 trillion in assets and 15 million accounts. And we'll convert the balance in May of this year. There's no question that this conversion has been a success. Attrition continues to track below the estimates that we shared in 2019 when the transaction was announced. Of course, we hate losing any clients, but we're realistic that some attrition is to be expected, and also knowing that we would be proactively stepping away from serving certain former Ameritrade clients for a variety of logical reasons."", ""Stepping back a bit to look at the bigger picture, we are committed to our through client-side strategy, and it underlines our no tradeoffs execution. We believe the backbone of organic growth is delivered by focusing on four areas: value, service, transparency, and trust with both our clients, as well as our prospects. Now the ultimate measure of value for clients is the balance between the quality of service and guidance they receive and the revenue we earn that pays for this service and guidance. And we don't believe any investment services firm delivers a better value than Schwab. The quality of our service is well recognized, and I'm going to go ahead and speak on that a little bit more momentarily. And the revenue we earn averages less than one quarter of 1%."", ""In fact, we've almost halved what clients pay us in one form or another over the past 20-years. When you compare that to what investors pay certain wirehouses or independent broker dealers or regionals, Schwab clients paid between approximately half or even in some cases close to a quarter of what they pay these other firms. Now that difference adds up to an enormous drag on client wealth creation over the years. It's one of the key structural advantages that clients of Charles Schwab benefit from. And we've been recognized for many years as a leader in client service in the financial services world. And despite the complexities inherent in the Ameritrade conversion, we retained our world-class results in 2023 for client service. Our net promoter score in our retail business remained in the mid-60s, while our overall speed to answer phone calls was about 30 seconds, with retail averaging just below 20 seconds last year."", ""Now these metrics are very important as our reputation for service and creating client loyalty extends across all of our client-facing businesses. Delivering world-class service is a never-ending area of emphasis, requires training, investment in digital and self-service capabilities, as well as a philosophical deep belief in the nobility of service. Service has always been at the core of our success at Schwab and will always remain so. Transparency is also a hallmark of Schwab, whether it be defined as our open architecture approach to investing, the clarity of any fees or charges assessed to our clients, or the fact that we've been a leader in both guaranteeing the security of our clients' assets, as well as their overall satisfaction. Our satisfaction guarantee is unique across the industry."", ""It's provided our clients with the confidence they deserve as they make investment decisions. And although the payments we've historically made under this satisfaction guarantee are relatively modest, we believe deeply in the philosophy of guaranteeing our clients delight with our services and guidance. We often say at Schwab that we are less in the investment business than we are in the trust business. And this was never more true than in 2023. As clients wanted to access their client cash that we held at our banks, we ensured they had ample liquidity to move that cash into money market funds, bonds, treasuries or other investments. And while this happened more quickly than we would have expected given the unparalleled pace of Fed rate moves, our contingency plans worked as designed to ensure that we could always be there to support our clients."", ""As a result, during a period of heightened concern about bank stability across the industry last spring, our clients were able to have confidence in Schwab. We're honored that both JD Power and Investor's Business Daily gave our firm and our bank the highest scores in the areas of investor satisfaction and trust, respectively, last year. And we're committed to maintaining and building trust with our clients in the years to come. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to take a moment to remind everyone that our strategies, our philosophies, and our execution at Schwab are not random. We evaluate everything we do by screening it through a series of lens that apply our experience and knowledge about the investing industry, both today as well as where it's headed in the future."", ""We categorize these viewpoints into three buckets and they may look familiar to those of you who've dialed into our calls in the past. Broad trends, client views, and the competitive landscape. If I were to highlight the viewpoints on these three buckets, it would be: first, we are ideally positioned to benefit from growth in the areas of the industry that have grown the fastest in recent years and project the most organic growth potential for the future. Self-directed investors and traders, RIAs serving as a fiduciary to their clients, and low-cost, tax-aware investing. Next, clients are looking for firms that offer a breadth of solutions that are personalized for them and make sense within the context of a financial plan. Ideally, firms should be able to assist clients with both sides of their balance sheet, investing and borrowing."", 'We believe the future will be won by firms that find the right balance between offering digital and mobile efficiency on par with non-financial services experience and of course paired with access to well-trained and credentialed professionals. Not surprising, given our viewpoints, we believe Schwab is optimally positioned for long-term organic growth. Rick, let me turn it over to you.', ""Rick Wurster: Thank you, Walt, and Good morning, everyone. Schwab is in a position of strength to deliver on the client expectations that Walt just spoke about. I'll spend our time together this morning talking about how we delivered for clients in 2023 within the strategic focus areas that you see on this page. I'll also share more about the investments we're making to continue building on our strong foundation, so we can do even more to help our current and future clients meet their financial goals, which in turn will bolster our organic growth and our competitive positioning. I'll start with scale and efficiency. Our number one priority in 2023 was to execute the largest integration in the history of the industry. And it has been a tremendous success."", 'As Walt highlighted, we brought about 90% of Ameritrade clients to Schwab, representing $1.6 trillion in converted assets, 7,000 RIA firms, and 15 million total converted accounts. While clients are getting used to navigating a new experience and a different way of doing things, they are also seeing the breadth of capabilities on our combined platform. We also focused in 2023 on reducing expenses. We captured approximately $500 million in annual run rate expense savings through streamlining our operating model, which included position eliminations from predominantly non-client facing areas, as well as reducing our real estate footprint. The remaining $400 million in Ameritrade expense synergies will be realized in the second-half of 2024 following the completion of the integration.', ""When we think about win-win monetization, we think about meeting more of our clients’ total financial needs, including more holistic solutions, lending capabilities, and access to high-quality, fairly priced products. This attracts and retains client assets and at the same time improves our economics. We generated strong results in our advice business with a 29% year-over-year increase in net advised flows, including $12 billion in net flows into our proprietary full-service wealth management solution, Schwab Wealth Advisory. This is a record for our firm. Wasmer Schroeder net flows were $6.7 billion, a record for the offer and a 90% increase over the prior year. And when it comes to direct indexing, we've enhanced our Schwab personalized indexing offer with expanded customization capabilities, a new account level digital dashboard, and digital enrollment."", ""We launched our fully digital Pledged Asset Line, or PAL, for RIA clients that gives advisors the ability to submit a PAL application in minutes, and clients can get approved in hours for straightforward applications and in just days for complex situations. We also launched Schwab Investing Themes, which allows self-directed investors to buy and sell themes of securities that align with their personal interests and values, all available through schwab.com as well as our mobile app. Finally, our goal in the third focus area is to see through clients' eyes to meet the unique needs of each of our clients' segments. Highlights from the last year include introducing our specialized asset-based segments for retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients, which we call Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services."", 'These tailored offers meet the unique needs of these clients who represent about 70% of our retail assets. Schwab Private Client Services includes access to a financial consultant, dedicated service, expanded access to specialists, as well as products and fee discounts. Schwab Private Wealth Service delivers all that plus prioritized service, enhanced support, expedited requests, priority access to wealth specialists and exclusive events, pricing benefits, American Express Statement Credit, bank benefits, and more. We also in 2023 launched Schwab Trading powered by Ameritrade, a reimagined trading experience made possible by the combination of the best of Schwab and Ameritrade. All clients can now access the thinkorswim trading platform, giving them access to a unique combination of powerful tools and dedicated service from experienced trading professionals alongside education for all levels of experience.', ""We also in 2023 enhanced our offer for all RIA clients. All clients can now access thinkpipes, our thinkpipes trading platform, which offers real-time charting, pre and post-trade allocations, and complex options functionality. In addition, we launched Ameritrade's iRebal and Model Market Center on Schwab Advisor Center, and are taking a measured approach to ensure a seamless onboarding experience for new iRebal users, with general access rolling out early this year. Finally, we acquired the family wealth alliance to expand our capabilities to serve both single-family and multi-family offices. As we look ahead in 2024, we will continue to focus on and make investments in our key strategic focus areas to drive our organic growth, fuel our virtuous cycle, and help clients achieve their financial goals."", ""One thing I'll point out about this page is that given our focus on continuing to make Schwab an easy place to do business, we are adding a fourth pillar to our strategic focus areas called EASE, which is about delivering exceptional and easy experiences to our clients. With 35 million client accounts, serving our clients exceptionally well will be a big driver of our organic growth. When we think about scale and efficiency, we're laser focused on successfully converting the final Ameritrade client transition group and then capturing our remaining expense synergies. We'll continue making investments in artificial intelligence to empower our teams to serve clients even more effectively. And finally, we will invest in automation and systems modernization over the next several years, allowing us to drive greater efficiency."", ""Win-win monetization remains an important opportunity where we can both delight clients and boost our revenue. Looking ahead, we'll continue to make investments to enable clients to keep more of their financial life with us, including a continued focus on lending capabilities that meets the needs of more clients across both IS and AS. We'll enhance our wealth and advice offerings, including making continued investments in Schwab Wealth Advisory. We'll continue to build on our momentum with personalized investing solutions, and we'll continue to broaden the breadth and depth of product offerings with new offers like alternative investments. And we continue to do work to integrate the workplace experience more into Schwab, allowing our workplace clients to benefit from all we have to offer at Schwab."", ""Within client segmentation, we'll remain focused on meeting the unique needs of our client segments, including our higher net worth clients, traders, and RIAs. Part of this is providing differentiated client experiences, just as we've done this year with the new retail high net worth and ultra-high net worth offers that I spoke to earlier. This also means enhanced service models, specialized capabilities, our powerful trading platform, and our tailored education. Our fourth focus area is Ease. With the size of our asset base, we can drive growth by simply delivering easy and exceptional experiences to our existing clients. This is where you'll see us continue to invest to make Schwab the easiest place in the industry to do business. And it's important to remember something Walt highlighted earlier."", ""Our client's frame of reference for Ease is not just other financial services firms, it's the experiences they have on Amazon or Uber or DoorDash, and that's the measure of ease we are striving to accomplish. We want every experience a client has with us to be an exceptional one. That means we'll continue to make enhancements on all of our channels. We'll continue to digitize client workflows and to make sure our clients have access when and where they want it, whether that's on schwab.com or the mobile app, or when they call or chat with our service teams or walk into a branch. We believe that the combination of these efforts will help power our long-term organic growth. Guided by our seeing through client-size strategy, we are well positioned to retain our clients and to win new ones, fueling our organic NNA growth over the long-term."", ""I've spoken about Schwab's unique strengths in this forum in the past. We have a top one or two position in the two fastest growing segments of financial services. Our strengths will help us attract assets from our existing clients, including our younger client base, valuable dedicated relationships, strong RIA growth, and our emphasis on ease. We'll attract new clients for the combination of the strength of our brand, our proven retail acquisition model, and our continued commitment to serving RIAs. And with the four strategic focus areas I just talked through, we'll be able to meet evolving client needs while making it easier for clients to keep more of their financial lives with us, helping us attract NNA over the long-term. Schwab's future is bright, and before I turn it over to Peter, I'd like to spend just a couple more minutes talking about some of the exciting opportunities ahead."", ""One of our biggest opportunities is to fully harness the powerful combination of Schwab and Ameritrade. While it is still relatively early days, when we look at our Ameritrade clients, we know they are already benefiting from the breadth of Schwab's capabilities, including both lending and wealth. 95% of former Ameritrade FCs have helped the client find a solution to their needs by enrolling them in a Schwab wealth solution. And former Ameritrade FCs accounted for about 20% of our record Schwab wealth advisory net flows in 2023. Today’s, former Ameritrade client advice penetration is at approximately 10%, which is above historical levels. Schwab clients are benefiting as well. We launched the new Schwab trading powered by Ameritrade experience in October, and at year-end, more than 80,000 Schwab clients had created new thinkorswim accounts."", ""And about 20% of new to firm retail clients opted to access a thinkorswim account. The opportunity ahead for us is tremendous. We have about a 12% share of the market, and we serve the two fastest growing segments. I just spoke about our early wins and increasing Ameritrade advice penetration. As we continue to win here, we believe we have a $500 billion plus share of wallet NNA opportunity ahead of us. And we believe the win-win monetization opportunities I've spoken about represent a 3.5 billion to 4 billion wealth management and bank lending revenue opportunity. To wrap up, our through-client size strategy continues to guide us into the next chapter. We're in the final stages of the Ameritrade integration, and we've made meaningful progress across our key strategic focus areas in the last year."", ""Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our healthy organic growth, and the opportunities in front of us remain highly attractive, both for Schwab and for our clients. And with that I'll turn it over to Peter."", ""Peter Crawford: Well thank you very much Rick. So Walt and Rick talked about how our no trade-off positioning continues to resonate with both clients and prospects. The continued progress we're making with the Ameritrade acquisition, with the final transition group scheduled for May, our achievements and priorities around scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, segmentation, and our newer priority ease, and the large opportunity in front of us over the coming years. In my time today, I'll briefly review our 2023 financial performance, provide an update on client cash realignment, and share some thoughts on 2024. The important point is that in the fourth quarter and really over the last nine months, we continue to see notable improvement across the various tactical metrics on which there has been a lot of focus lately, including the pace of client cash reallocation activity, the level of supplemental borrowing we're utilizing, and our capital levels inclusive of AOCI."", ""And what that means is that 2024 is likely to be somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but with steadily improving financial results that bridge from what proved to be a challenging 2023 to what we believe is a very promising future ahead. And so while environmental factors may not allow progress to follow a strictly linear path, we believe we're moving ever closer to the point where the noise partially obscuring our long-term growth should dissipate and our relatively straightforward financial formula should begin to reassert itself once again powered by solid organic growth, our diversified business model converting that asset growth into strong revenue growth through the cycle; continued expense discipline, producing growing margins."", ""And as our tangible capital levels continue to grow, the return of meaningful opportunistic capital return. In other words, a resumption of the proven model that you are all familiar with and that has delivered for clients and stockholders for over five decades. As Walt mentioned, 2023 was an eventful year for many of our clients and certainly a challenging one for our business model. And so not surprisingly, our financial performance was off 2022's record levels with a little under $19 billion of revenue and $3.13 of adjusted EPS. But despite those financial headwinds, we still produced an adjusted pre-tax margin of over 40%. Our fifth consecutive year doing so, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model through a wide range of environments."", 'Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. The big story last year, of course, was the roughly 30% decline in client cash on our balance sheet, of which over 80% moved in the first-half of the year. This was the outcome of clients moving some of their cash into higher-earning alternatives, as Walt mentioned, that was often with our active support and encouragement. And importantly, that money is staying at Schwab, as evidenced by the approximately $200 billion increase in purchase money funds and over $225 billion increase in fixed income in CDs our clients hold. And we supported some of that activity by utilizing temporary or supplemental borrowing, including both FHLB advances and Schwab Bank CDs. And at just under $80 billion at the end of the quarter, those have fallen by more than $17 billion from the peak level reached in May.', ""And finally, our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio rising to 8.5% and our adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the AOCI opt-out, at Schwab Bank now nearly 5.4%, meaning we are now meeting what will likely be the new quote well capitalized standard at our banks over four years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date. During last quarter's update, we talked about the slowing pace of client cash realignment over the preceding months. And in November, our clients actually added to their transactional cash balances. And then in December, we saw an approximately $15 billion increase in transactional sweep cash."", ""Now, historically, December flows benefit from seasonal factors, but even so, when you compare December 2023 to December 2022, it is quite clear that this dynamic is receding as an important driver for us. You can also see that trend when you look at purchase money fund flows and specifically that minority of those net flows that are funded from client cash on the balance sheet. Now, as we turn our attention to 2024, our near-term financial performance will, as always, be shaped by external factors that are difficult to predict. Interest rates, equity market performance, and client trading activity. And then given the much larger sensitivity to client cash allocations, given where interest rates are today than they were, let's say three years ago, that will, of course, be a significant factor."", ""So let's talk about this one. And given the importance of this, let's spend a bit more time here. There are really three main forces that will influence the trend of our clients' transactional cash during 2024. Any remaining client cash realignment from existing clients, the contribution of cash we attract from new clients, which I'll talk about in a moment, is the source of the greatest uncertainty moving forward, and seasonal dynamics that are generally similar every year, but can vary based on environmental conditions. We'll start with the behavior of our existing clients. And as we've discussed, we're clearly in the very late innings of the client cash realignment activity. You can see it in the monthly reporting we have shared, whether you look at total balances, balances per account, or cash as a percent of assets."", ""And that high level trend is supported by various dynamics you see when you look under the hood. We're seeing stabilization of activity among both RIA and retail clients. Now we've talked about how cash realignment is an event, not a process. And we're seeing a decrease in both the number of those events and the average amount of the cash being realigned. Now while we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to predict the behavior of our existing clients, it's a bit harder to do so with new clients over a very short timeframe, like a year. Now, that contribution depends on the level of new clients we attract and the size of those accounts. And then how much of the net new assets comes in the form of cash and stays there, which will be influenced by investor sentiment, quantitative tightening by the Fed, inflation, savings rates, and so forth."", ""And then you throw in that this is an election year, which normally brings an elevated degree of volatility, makes these predictions even tougher. And what this means is that while we have seen throughout our history that over time, cash balances grow with the growth in accounts and assets, over a shorter period, like a quarter or a year, it's harder to gauge exactly how much new accounts will contribute. And finally, the evolution of transactional cash over the course of 2024 is likely to be influenced by seasonal patterns, which follow a similar trajectory every year, but can vary in terms of their magnitude. That means we're seeing some cash getting invested into the markets in the first quarter. And given the large inflows we saw in December, the investment activity could be at an elevated start this year."", ""And then we'll likely see a reduction in April as clients pay taxes before we cap the year with an anticipated buildup in December. So what does all this mean for our 2024 financial performance? Given the various moving pieces, we decided to bring back a concept you may recall we last used in 2019, which is to share with you a couple of mathematical illustrations around how our financial performance could unfold, based on what happens with certain and difficult to predict inputs. And those are trading activity. We looked at flat to 2023 levels, plus or minus 5%. And where transactional cash finishes the year relative to the 12/31 levels. Again, flat plus 5% or minus 10%. Those illustrations share a couple of common and pretty conventional assumptions."", ""Most importantly, normal market appreciation and rates that follow the dot plots. And those illustrations could result in revenue that is plus or minus 5% there are 2023 levels or said another way, revenue that is 0% to 10% higher than our annualized Q4 2023 run rate, even with three rate cuts. We're planning, as we've shared previously, to keep adjusted expenses flat year-over-year. And that would result in an adjusted pre-tax margin of a little under 40% to somewhere in the mid-40s. Now I know it's tempting to pick the mid-point of the illustrations and interpret that as our outlook. That is not how these illustrations are intended to be used. This is just math. Using some metrics, you can track on an ongoing basis to evolve your own perspectives on our potential performance over time."", ""And as we typically do, we have included in the appendix a set of sensitivities intended to help you make adjustments as you see fit. Now looking at the range of possibility, it doesn't apply much of any growth in terms of full year adjusted EPS. But given the consistent pay down in the higher cost supplemental borrowing, it suggests strong sequential momentum in revenue and in earnings. With a potential exit velocity heading into 2025, that is at least 20% better than where we ended 2023. And with increasing momentum as we progress through 2025 as well. Let's drill a little deeper into the expense story. Schwab has been and always will be a growth company, a company that continually invests in improving the client experience. At the same time, we're a company that recognizes that one of our biggest competitive advantages, as Walt mentioned, is our industry-leading cost structure, which is measured as EOCA."", ""Achieving both of those requires careful balance and discipline. And in 2024, even as we're holding spending flat, we're still making significant investments that Rick talked about that will help sustain our long-term organic growth, boost our revenue, and increase our efficiency during 2024 and beyond. Our current revenue and earnings are being pressured, of course, by our utilization of the higher cost funding in the form of CDs and FHLB advances. Those are very much a temporary funding source. And as we pay off those, we continue to see a path towards a net interest margin in the 2.20% to 2.50% range by the end of this year and approaching 3% by the end of 2025 even if rates fall roughly 200 basis points from where they are today, as the dot plots would indicate, with a potential for it to expand further moving forward as we reinvest our securities portfolio at higher market rates than what we currently earn."", ""Now while we pause our buyback in order to build our capital levels, capital return remains a very important part of our financial formula, given our very high return on capital and negligible credit exposure. Our capital levels have already reached the so-called well-capitalized threshold, even if AOCI is included. And we'd expect our consolidated adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio to reach the upper 6% range by the end of 2024, at which point we'll be in a position to at least consider resuming opportunistic buybacks. Both Walt and I talked about 2024 being somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint, but we also talked about the steady improvement we expect to see throughout the year. In some ways, I hate to use the phrase coiled spring, but I think that's exactly what is being set up as we move into 2025, as we complete the Ameritrade integration, creating a true best of breed platform and unlocking both revenue and expense synergies."", 'We continue to advance our strategic agenda even as we maintain flat expenses. Transactional cash balances inflect and we begin to see sustained growth. And all that plus continued business momentum creates an opportunity for a return to sequential revenue growth and accelerating momentum toward the end of the year and into 2025. And that paves the way for a return to our long-term financial formula. One that is powered by our position as the premier asset gatherer, producing consistent 5% to 7% organic growth through the cycle with industry-leading client loyalty and a leadership position in the two fastest growing segments within wealth management. One that has a proven ability to expand margins through the cycle with the potential for even more dramatic margin expansion in the years ahead, back above 50% as revenue benefits from paying off higher cost borrowings and expenses benefits from harvesting the remaining expense energies.', ""And one that can combine that strong organic growth and revenue growth with more meaningful capital return as our capital levels inclusive of AOCI march higher. And so when you take a step back and look at our potential financial performance, your perspective depends on your time frame. In the immediate term, we have been dealing with some pressures that have constrained our financial results. But those pressures are temporary, not permanent. So long-term opportunity, the long-term potential remains significant. And as an organization that has a long time horizon, that is what fuels our optimism, our confidence, and our excitement for what lies ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to facilitate our Q&A. Jeff?"", 'Jeff Edwards: Hi, operator.

10,8b47a2c5-0cf9-3f63-bc55-c6101a8d34ec,RRC,2024-01-23,What Caused the Collapse in Natural Gas Prices Last Week?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caused-collapse-natural-gas-prices-131100125.html,1705929060,STORY,"['NG=F', 'LNG', 'RRC']","[""The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a lower-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The bearish inventory numbers, together with predictions of weaker weather-related demand in late January, weighed on natural gas futures, which settled with a heavy loss week over week.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas, with the commodity trading considerably lower over the past 12 months due to growing worries about record output and concerns about an ongoing supply glut. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG."", 'Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 154 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Jan 12, below the analyst guidance of some 165 Bcf withdrawal. The decrease compared with the five-year (2019-2023) average net shrinkage of 126 Bcf and last year’s decline of 68 Bcf for the reported week.The latest draw puts total natural gas stocks at 3,182 Bcf, which is 350 Bcf (12.4%) above the 2023 level and 320 Bcf (11.2%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 103.6 Bcf per day, down 6.8 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a slump in dry production, with frigid weather triggering blackouts and causing processing plants to shut down.Meanwhile, daily consumption jumped to 150.2 Bcf from 131.1 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting strength in residential/commercial usage and higher power burn triggered by widespread, below-average temperatures.', ""Natural gas prices plunged last week following the lower-than-expected inventory decrease. Futures for February delivery ended Friday at $2.52 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling some 24% from the previous week’s closing. The drop in natural gas realization is also the result of predictions of warmer-than-normal weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With forecasts beyond the current cold arctic blast turning warmer (toward the end of January), usage of the commodity to generate electricity is likely to take a hit. It's worth mentioning that natural gas has been under pressure from near-record output, with current inventory levels well above the year-ago figure and the five-year average. \xa0Having said that, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down some 23% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. Despite the prevailing deep freeze disrupting some scheduled departures, LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months, reaching record levels due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies due to the war in Ukraine."", 'The upshot of all of these factors — the natural gas market — remains an oversupplied one. As a matter of fact, it endured a torrid year in 2023, as prices tumbled more than 40%, briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020.Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably hold on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.

Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.8%. Valued at around $18.3 billion, CTRA has fallen 5.4% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 602.8% for the current year.

Now, let me turn it over to Ron."", ""Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I am proud of how we carefully navigated State Street through various headwinds, while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda. We focused and delivered on that agenda in three key areas; achieve strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our investment services business and remain disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead."", ""We took these many actions all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry, faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023. In the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution from several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market moves seen in decades. In the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progress into the third quarter and as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in 2022 years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial sell off in bond markets with the US 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October, for the first time since the global financial crisis."", 'Rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns caused equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot to lower interest rates this year. In sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year.', 'And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses. Slide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was 5.58 or 7.66 excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 billion of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business and higher securities finance revenues. The combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled. We continued to build business momentum and position State Street for longer term success.', ""To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we're making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead. Within the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our Alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth, particularly in our core back office custody."", ""Encouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth for the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years. From its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish, broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back."", ""2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. Last two quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propel CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward. In 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording four new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales. Within our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continued to see proof points of our very strong market position."", 'For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across four important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach, including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading firm CF Global Trading. At Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving occupancy growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management.', 'Our cash business had an exceptional year delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and US low cost equity and fixed income ETFs. Turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts. Underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realize productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model.', ""As we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of one of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive free operating leverage in 2024. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation. You can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business trends and indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters."", 'For example, over the last five quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date. To conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year, we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results.', 'Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser focused on these goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail.', 'Eric Aboaf: Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS. First, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses.', 'We expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly six quarters and begin this quarter with roughly two-thirds of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years. Turning to Slide 6. I will begin my review of both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation, notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivot and geopolitical concerns, pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year. In terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter.', ""In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up and we gained share. Back office servicing fees was challenged for much of the year as the client's transactional activity was muted but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry wide headwinds in our global markets businesses, given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and specials activity in agency lending throughout the year. NII has been tough to predict and surprise to the part of this quarter compared to third quarter."", ""I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth. Relative to the year ago, total expenses ex-notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Finally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3% excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth for our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions."", ""Turning now to Slide 7. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, period end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows. Notably, as Ron mentioned earlier and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table of market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, specials activity in agency lending and flows in margins and FX trading."", ""On Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition, partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements to our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance."", ""These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year. Finally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows."", 'Relative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiatives. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETF, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the SPDR portfolio US low cost suite experiencing consistent market share gains. In our institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products.', 'And lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion, primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion and institutional money market fund market share gains. Turning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX trading services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex-notables and 2% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility. Fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher specials activity and prime services revenue.', ""Moving on to software and processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impact associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Moving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversion, driving software enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on premise renewals and go live implementations."", 'Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We’re pleased to report four more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means seven wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering five to seven, to 10 years. We’ve also gone live with three more Alpha clients which brings us to six for the year, which sets us up well for 2024, and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year, driven by 20 plus SaaS client implementations and conversions, and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million.', ""Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning, as well as higher deposits and loan balances. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed's Reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in clients leaving higher bank deposit balances."", ""It's hard to know how deposits will trend but we are pleased with this higher step-off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with non-interest bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex-FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, Private Markets, Core Custody and tech and ops process improvements and automation."", 'On a line-by-line basis and year-over-year, ex-notables, compensation employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend and performance based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits. Transaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees.', ""Lastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we have streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations joint ventures, and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring. This consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contractor services and in the years ahead as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in sourced global capabilities."", 'However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line. These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and our regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases.', 'The decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios. And some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end of period print. Going forward, I would expect RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date.', ""Turning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook, as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point to point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligns with the forward curve as of year end 2023, which I would note continues to move. We expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter."", 'And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation. And I would remind you that a weaker US dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses. So we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex-notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by higher market levels and continued business momentum and continued strong growth in front office software and data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8% and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS new business and conversions and on-premise renewals.', ""We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q '24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations. Turning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex-notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7 times last year's gross savings level."", 'Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, keeping in mind that seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well controlled expenses. Finally, we expect taxes should be in the 21% to 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.', ""Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric.

LULU is benefiting from continued business momentum and innovative products. The company’s top and bottom lines have been witnessing positive trends on robust traffic in stores and e-commerce. LULU has been capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement, which are expected to boost its performance. It is on track with the Power of Three X2 growth plan.The company reported notable increase in net revenues and earnings per share during the holiday season, underlining its resilience and ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences. LULU witnessed balanced sales trends across channels, categories and geographies during the holiday selling period, which enabled it to raise its view for the fiscal fourth quarter. Sales mainly gained from its focus on fresher styles. Management noted that guests continued to respond positively to lululemon's innovative and versatile product offerings.Gains from these positive trends have been well-reflected in its share price.

As part of the Power of Three X2 growth plan, LULU estimates net revenues of $12.5 billion by 2026, implying significant growth from the 2021 reported figure of $6.25 billion. The plan focuses on three key growth drivers, including product innovation, guest experience and market expansion.The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, each of the women’s business and North America operations are anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China as well as markets in Europe, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, total net revenue CAGR is expected to be 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, it believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.LULU expects to capture the growing online demand and ensure robust shopping experience through its accelerated e-commerce investments. It has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities. The company continues to strengthen omni-channel capabilities such as curbside pickups, same day deliveries and BOPUS (buy online pick up in store). It is enhancing its mobile app in a bid to offer the curbside pickup facility and train its store associates to help customers speed up transactions.In third-quarter fiscal 2023, direct-to-consumer net revenues rose 18% (up 19% on a constant-dollar basis). In the digital channel, revenues accounted for 41% of net revenues. E-commerce traffic also improved 20% in the fiscal third quarter.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the company anticipates net revenues in the range of $3.170-$3.190 billion, indicating a 14-15% increase from a year ago. It earlier predicted net revenues in the $3.135-$3.170 billion band. The raised revenue guidance reflects the brand's strong market performance.Earnings per share are expected to be between $4.96 and $5.00 for the fiscal fourth quarter, showcasing an upward revision from $4.85-$4.93 stated earlier. The revised view reflects strong sales as well as the brand's effective cost management and operational efficiency.While there are upward revisions in net revenues, earnings per share and the gross margin, the company retained its previous guidance for SG&A expenses and the effective tax rate.

The key reason is that companies that regularly boost the size of their dividend checks tend to be high-quality businesses capable of delivering strong financial results in nearly any kind of economic environment.', 'In short, the dividend growth investing strategy is a proven way to build wealth over time. Armed with this insight, here are five blue chip dividend growth stocks that are near locks to make you richer over time.', '1. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the leading big box retailer in the U.S., with annual sales expected to surpass $666 billion in 2025 and a network of 4,622 stores across the country as of now.\xa0Walmart also has a strong presence in the global market and a high demand for its Walmart+ subscription service, making it a key competitor in the online retail space.', ""The company has been paying and increasing its dividend every year since 1974. In the last 10 years, Walmart has raised its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 1.94%. The retail giant's current yield is 1.4%, which is decent for a large-cap company still in growth mode. Its dividend is also sustainable, evidenced by its low payout ratio of 37.7%."", ""Walmart may not offer impressive dividend growth or yield, but it does have a commendable track record of regular increases to its payout. The company's solid competitive advantage also provides shareholders with an all-important margin of safety."", '2. Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) has been pushing the boundaries of biotech innovation since 1980. The company was among the first to successfully develop and market biologically based medicines, an industry that has grown into a $511 billion-plus market and continues to expand by double digits every year.', ""Amgen has boosted the size of its dividend checks every year since 2011, and its 10-year dividend growth rate stands at a blistering 13.9%. The biotech currently offers an above-average yield of 2.92%. Amgen's generous dividend also screens as safe, given its modest payout ratio of 59.2%, robust top-line growth prospects (estimated 15.8% growth in 2024), and management's commitment to rewarding loyal shareholders."", '3. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is a leading producer and distributor of beverages and snacks worldwide. The company owns many well-known brands, such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Doritos, Cheetos, and more. PepsiCo has a strong track record of dividend growth, with 51 years of consecutive increases and a 10-year dividend growth rate of 8.2%. The company offers a solid 2.98% annualized yield, but its payout ratio of 80.5% is somewhat elevated. However, PepsiCo is delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth currently, which should sustain its top-notch dividend policy.', ""4. Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is the world's largest pure-play medical device company. It sports leading positions in several high-growth markets, such as cardiac care, diabetes management, neurostimulation, and minimally invasive surgery. Medtronic has also demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders with a remarkable 46-year streak of dividend increases."", ""Over the last 10 years, the company has raised its dividend by an average of 9% annually. Moreover, Medtronic offers a solid 3.19% yield at current prices. The dividend is well supported by the company's mid-single-digit revenue growth outlook for fiscal year 2025 and management's dedication to the program despite its hefty 88.9% payout ratio."", ""5. Altria (NYSE: MO) is a leading tobacco company in the U.S. that enjoys a dominant market position. On the dividend side of the ledger, the tobacco giant offers a generous yield of almost 10%. The company has also increased its dividend 58 times in the last 54 years, demonstrating management's dedication to rewarding shareholders. However, Altria also has a high payout ratio of 77.5% at current levels."", 'Altria has grown its dividend payments by 6.5%, on average, per year over the previous decade. And even though the cigarette smoking rate in the U.S. is declining, Altria is expected to achieve low-single-digit revenue growth for the rest of the decade thanks to its strong pricing power and limited competition in the premium cigarette brand segment.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

The new bull market is promising, but with potential volatility on the horizon, it can be tempting to hold off on investing until the market stabilizes.', ""However, the harsh reality of the stock market is that it's never truly stable in the short term.

If you're investing in shaky companies, you could end up losing a lot of money if your stocks don't recover."", ""There's no one-size-fits-all approach to choosing stocks, but the best investments are from healthy companies. These organizations will have solid fundamentals, including strong financials, a knowledgeable and competent leadership team, and a competitive advantage in the industry."", ""Even the strongest stocks may be hit hard during downturns, but there's a good chance they'll recover. When your portfolio is full of these types of stocks, you won't need to worry as much about losing money during market slumps. Simply keep focusing on the long term and wait for the market to recover."", ""There's a lot of conflicting information out there when it comes to the stock market, and the truth is that nobody knows what will happen in the coming weeks or months.

Others told Yahoo Finance in December it could be worth even more, with many opining that its robust real estate portfolio is likely the target of the buyout.', 'A new owner could strip out or sell off Macy’s valuable assets, eventually leaving it a shell of its former self.', '""To some degree, Macy\'s board and management needs to be concerned ... that this is going to ultimately end up in a Sears situation,"" said Morningstar analyst David Swartz.', 'Arkhouse’s plan to unlock value would likely mean a “very different trajectory for Macy’s,” said Neil Saunders, GlobalData’s managing director of retail. The company is one of the last department stores standing. JCPenney, Lord & Taylor, Stage Stores, Bon-Ton, Belk, and Sears have closed roughly 1,500 locations since 2018, per JPMorgan.', 'Near-term investors focused on a higher stock price may see the renewed attention on Macy’s as a potential positive, according to Chen.', 'However, the bigger problem is that shareholders are not currently benefiting from Macy’s real estate portfolio, like its flagship location at New York City’s Herald Square, says Swartz.', 'While the company beat modest estimates in its latest quarterly earnings results, its stock, before the announcement of the buyout bid in December, was down 45% compared to five years ago.', ""As of Monday, shares are still down 28% compared to five years ago. Its competitors Nordstrom and Kohl's are down more than 60%. Macy’s may come to regret passing on this offer if the trend continues."", '""They don\'t want to be in a situation where two years from now people are regretting that they didn\'t take an offer, or not necessarily take it, at least consider it,"" said Swartz.', 'In 2018, Nordstrom rejected a buyout offer from the Nordstrom family that valued the company at $50 per share, which was below its trading price at the time.', 'Its stock is now trading at less than $20. ""There\'s risk in not pursuing these offers,"" Swartz said, adding that going private could allow Macy’s to make “major changes” to its declining business model.', 'And the company may have another battle coming — the director nomination window for its board opened on Saturday and closes on Feb. 19, according to proxy filings.', 'Saunders said Arkhouse ""could use the nomination process to get some people or backers onto Macy’s board."" There is ""no guarantee of success,"" and doing so would ""likely create some hostility with Macy’s management.""', 'Regardless of the buyout, Macy’s future will likely look very different from now. Last week, it laid off over 2,300 workers, or 3.5% of its workforce — a sign that its holiday season and 2024 outlook aren’t very strong, according to Swartz.', ""The company is also in the midst of a leadership change, as Bloomingdale's CEO Tony Spring plans to take the helm in February from Jeff Gennette, who has been CEO since 2017."", 'Some of its moves, like opening smaller store formats and shuttering less productive stores, are on the right track, says Kniffen. Yet, more are needed to increase shareholder returns, such as differentiating its stores, engaging younger consumers, and launching a marketplace, per Chen.', 'But it’s clear that going forward, Macy’s will be playing for survival.', ""“If the industry keeps going the way that it has been going, then you do have to wonder if [Macy’s] is going to be viable in the long term. We're seeing competition, like the rise of Shein,” said Swartz."", '“The whole apparel/retail industry is changing rapidly and it\'s not moving towards department stores.""', '—', 'Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In addition to laying out Gorman’s compensation Friday, the bank said it raised Pick’s base salary to $1.5 million for 2024, to put it in line with what Gorman earned as CEO.

Additionally, 60% of Gorman’s bonus is based on performance.', 'Friday’s compensation bump represented somewhat of a victory lap for Gorman as Morgan Stanley reflected on his 14-year tenure as CEO and how far the bank has come since its near-collapse in 2008.', 'Under Gorman’s leadership, Morgan Stanley’s stock price more than tripled since 2010, and its market capitalization nearly quadrupled to $153 billion, the bank said.', 'Additionally, Gorman led a transformation in which the bank put greater focus on wealth and investment management.

Pick, formerly the bank’s institutional securities chief, won out in October over Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz, then the heads of wealth management and investment management, respectively. But, in atypical fashion, Morgan Stanley was able to retain both Saperstein and Simkowitz when it offered each of them — and Pick — bonuses worth $20 million. The fourth CEO candidate, former Chief Operating Officer Jon Pruzan, left Morgan Stanley last January, and became president of the investment firm Pretium.', 'The bank also credited Gorman with “the resolution of many outstanding legal and regulatory matters.” That may well be a nod to the $249 million settlement to which Morgan Stanley agreed this month, to put to rest a Justice Department probe into the bank’s block-trading practices.', 'As it stands, Gorman’s $37 million package for 2023 ranks as his richest for a single year, topping the $35 million he received for 2021 (again, besting the $34.5 million Dimon earned that year).', 'Morgan Stanley cut Gorman’s compensation by 10% in 2022, to $31.5 million.

The company is positioned to be a beneficiary over the next couple of years from the ongoing global recovery in energy capital spending in my estimation. I also believe Nabors has significant international business that is not being appreciated by the marketplace. Their joint-venture (JV) with Saudi Aramco alone could add 5 rigs per year over the next 10 years, with each rig possibly contributing more than $10M in Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Appreciation (EBITDA). In addition, as their proprietary drilling solutions and energy transition businesses further scale up it should lead to greater free cash flow (FCF) conversion given their lower capital intensity. Since the beginning of 2018, management has focused free cash flow on debt reduction, eliminating nearly $2B in debt. Nabors’s balance sheet risk has diminished, with limited near-term maturities and net debt leverage ending 2023 close to 2x.

In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

Especially because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes AI will impact 40% of jobs globally."", 'AI/ML is an expansive area, so it may be tough to know where to start.

Without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products, AI applications would be difficult to execute. This has brought the company incredible success, which the infographic below depicts."", 'First, we can see that total revenue increased 205% year over year (YOY) to $18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on the back of data center revenue, which increased 278% to $14.5 billion -- a ridiculous clip. Even more incredible, data center growth accelerated in Q3 of fiscal year 2024, eclipsing 171% in Q2.', ""The next major takeaway is the company's operating income (center of the graphic). It soared 1,633% to $10.4 billion on a 57% margin. Nvidia's profits skyrocketed because demand was higher than supply. They cannot produce enough to satisfy their customers, so they have pricing power."", 'Nvidia has some challenges, like U.S. restrictions on exports to China and competition working hard; however, Nvidia creates new chips that meet export requirements to China, and it has a significant head start on competitors like Advanced Micro Devices\xa0and Intel.', ""Trading at 74 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap and likely won't be anytime soon. This drops to 46x on a forward basis (compared to Microsoft\xa0at 35x), which is more palatable."", ""Wall Street has a history of underestimating Nvidia's future earnings. Still, be cautious at the current price or consider dollar-cost averaging."", ""In late 2022, Alphabet found itself caught flat-footed when OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the stage, and Microsoft invested billions to bring the generative AI tech to Bing.

There is Bard, Alphabet's answer to ChatGPT. Alphabet recently upgraded Bard with its Gemini tech to enhance its performance."", 'Google Search has new features that allow users to search with a picture, optimize translation services, and provide more relevant results. The company developed its own chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), for generative AI applications. Perhaps the ChatGPT release was the kick in the pants Alphabet needed to get its AI program to the market.', ""Alphabet's sales are up 7% YOY through Q3 2023 to $221 billion; however, growth accelerated to 11% in the last quarter. More impressively, cash from operations is up 22% this year, reaching $83 billion to show that Alphabet is still a cash-flow machine. The stock is fairly valued, trading close to its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27."", ""Amazon is among the most exciting AI companies because it benefits from AI on multiple fronts. Generative AI software requires massive data processing, much of which runs through the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest provider of cloud services. Growth at AWS slowed in 2023 because companies cut their data usage budgets in anticipation of a recession, but AI and increased budgets could turn this around in 2024."", 'The company also uses AI in digital advertising and logistics, and Amazon Bedrock provides foundational models for companies to tailor AI applications to their needs.', 'While AWS growth slowed in 2023, areas like digital advertising thrived, and Amazon grew total revenue by 11% through Q3 2023 to $405 billion. Positive free cash flow and net income also returned after a difficult 2022.', 'The stock trades well below its recent averages based on operating cash flow and sales, as shown below.', 'The valuation and opportunity make Amazon stock an alluring buy.', 'Palantir has been unapologetically hyping its AI prowess since before AI was the thing to be. The company helps governments and businesses manage, analyze, visualize, and act on data. It also provides a platform where clients can build and deploy applications, and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software expands on this by using AI to enhance logical decision-making.', ""Palantir is a critical partner in the defense industry and is making strides in the private sector. Last quarter, private sector sales increased 23% YOY to $251 million, while government sales grew 12% to $308 million. Palantir also achieved its fourth straight quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits, has $3.3 billion in cash and investments, and has no long-term debt. It's no wonder it's a popular stock. Still, its 17% YOY growth last quarter may not justify its current valuation of 17x sales."", 'UiPath is getting some well-deserved attention lately. The company is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). RPA has many use cases that get to the heart of AI/ML: efficiency.', 'For instance, picture a large company that receives hundreds of invoices daily through email. Instead of manually downloading and inputting them (as is the case now), RPA does this automatically with minimal human intervention. This is why UiPath reported $1.4 billion annual recurring revenue on 24% growth and over 10,800 customers last quarter.', 'There is intense industry competition, namely from Microsoft, which gives investors pause. However, the company is on firm financial footing, reporting $1.75 billion in cash and investments with no long-term debt, and trades for just 10x sales.

The first way is training models, which is called, well, training. The second is putting those models into practice so that people can use them to do things like generate a specific output you want, whether that’s in the form of a text, images, or something else entirely. That’s called inferencing.', 'OpenAI has inferences of ChatGPT, while Microsoft has inferences of Copilot.

He highlights CVS\' vertical integration through acquiring Aetna, with insurance risks balanced by free cash flow and earnings growth. Morris likes the steady growth, saying ""we really like a company that not only is growing, but can reliably beat the street.""', 'Conversely, he names Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) a stock to avoid due to high leadership turnover that ""can\'t seem to make good investments reliably."" Morris says the shakeups have hurt strategy and operations, translating to poor stock and earnings performance. With Walgreens relying solely on pharmacy versus CVS\' diversified insurance mix, he warns ""when that\'s your only revenue driver, that\'s a problem."" Morris also warns that contracting free cash flow declines, cautioning that ""they\'ll run out of money.""', 'Click here to watch more of Good Buy or Goodbye or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", '[MUSIC PLAYING]', ""JULIE HYMAN: It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to Good Buy or Goodbye. Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio."", ""Today, we're checking up on the best way to play the shifting health care landscape, particularly when it comes to the retail side. I'm here with Alex Morris, FM Investments president and chief investment officer. Good to see you. Thanks for coming in."", 'ALEX MORRIS: Thanks for having me.', ""JULIE HYMAN: So let's get to your buy on this side of the equation and that is CVS Health that we are talking about here. Here's the stock over the past year. It's kind of trended a little bit down, but let's look at some of the catalysts that you say can help it from here. Experienced leadership, first of all, talk me through that one."", ""ALEX MORRIS: So the leadership team has been intact for a long time, which in changing marketplace isn't always true. And this leadership team in particular has shown the ability to grow the business, and to grow it on like metrics, and to keep what is a pretty competitive space very competitive for them. So I like the way they've positioned themselves and their consistency."", ""JULIE HYMAN: What's interesting too about CVS is obviously it's not just a pharmacy chain. They now have a much bigger business and that vertically integrated business model where they offer insurance as well."", ""ALEX MORRIS: Right, their merger with Aetna took them out of just the shop that you see on every street corner, which is good for the first part of their business. But now, they're vertically integrated across all parts of what you need in keeping yourself healthy. So when you're going to go to buy something like a prescription, you're going to buy other items from the store as well. And that's something their competitors just don't have. Now, that also has with it all of the headaches that come with being an insurance company, but some of those are some pretty attractive financial metrics that we really like, that will hold them through what might be difficult retail times in the coming weeks and months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about the financial metrics now because you are looking at things like free cash flow and earnings growth. If we take the latter of those and look at earnings growth, there it is. Here's the earnings per share growth that we've seen over the past few years and the estimate for this year."", ""ALEX MORRIS: We like the trend line. I mean, everyone would expect this to be for every stock. It's not, not every stock can be an AI chip stock. But we like the growth rate and we like the fact that they're also using their free cash flow well."", 'So growth rate is going up. And they also beat estimates, which I think is underestimated. Really like a company that not only is growing, but that can reliably beat the Street.', 'And when that happens stock prices tend to follow. They tend to follow with a little extra pop. So you get the good underlying company and then a little benefit for that underlying momentum that translate in higher prices.', 'JULIE HYMAN: We also like to talk about not just what the bull case, but what could go wrong. And you sort of alluded to it when you said there are advantages to having this integrated model, but then there are some risks. And one of the risks is a medical loss ratio, which is basically a metric that you look at in the insurance business. How much of your premiums are you paying out to take care of patients?', ""ALEX MORRIS: Yeah, the biggest problem is they're also an insurance company. So folks have put off getting some health care during the pandemic. Some of that has trickled through to today. More folks can come back. Plus, it's health care, there's a lot of things that can go wrong in running insurance company."", ""They do it well and we like their ability to monetize elements of that value chain. But they're still running an insurance company. And when things go wrong in the insurance company, you can have an unlimited amount of money needed to take care of your health."", ""You don't have an unlimited amount of money for Skittles. So we see that as a risk. But so far, they've managed it very well."", 'JULIE HYMAN: And just to be clear here, do you guys have CVS in your portfolio?', 'ALEX MORRIS: So we do have CVS and portfolios.', ""JULIE HYMAN: OK, got you. So that's the buy, let's get to the goodbye, the one that you do not like as much in this space. And that is Walgreens Boots Alliance here and there the stock has been a worst performer over the past year. Here too is sort of the inverse of the other, right?"", 'ALEX MORRIS: Exactly.', ""JULIE HYMAN: We're starting with high leadership turnover."", ""ALEX MORRIS: They just can't seem to keep a lot of folks in the top chairs. And you see that across strategy and they haven't had a really coherent strategy. And you see that across just all the business units they're trying to operate where when you don't have that sort of coherent leadership, you don't get a single message. You see that translate in the stock price, you see that translating earnings, and we're going to see that in some other charts where they just can't seem to make good investments reliably. And that's a problem when we want stocks to go up over time based on good investing."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And then the other sort of inverse is that it's just a pharmacy chain right they don't have insurance and some of the other businesses."", ""ALEX MORRIS: They have no offset to what has become a very big shoplifting problem. I mean, you walk into most Boots, most Walgreens, most CVS to that extent as well, but shoplifting has become a big issue. Some stores are closing, particularly in high traffic areas where municipalities haven't been able to combat that and without an offset to that. Without a reason to bring people into your brand store, it's hard to really justify keeping some of those stores around. And when that's your only revenue driver, that's a problem."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, interesting. And then finally, if you look at what's going on with their free cash flow and earnings, you've got sort of not as clear picture."", ""ALEX MORRIS: Yeah, it's a mixed message here. And if we look at this on a free cash flow basis, we would see that CVS is growing at about 17% a year. Walgreens Boots is contracting at about 50% on a five-year basis. And that's just going the wrong direction."", ""So although they trade a little cheaper, they have a greater dividend yield than CVS, they don't seem to make good investments with their own capital. And for the short run, that might be nice for a short term dividends. It's not great for the long term outlook because eventually they'll run out of money."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. And then if there's something that could go wrong for your bare thesis in this one, it's perhaps the new CEO of the company Tim Wentworth. There is some optimism that is surrounding his appointment that he might turn things around for the company."", ""ALEX MORRIS: He's an industry veteran. He's done these things before. I think he will be successful in the long run. The risk to our thesis is he successful faster than we might expect? And if he is, then it's great news for WBA holders."", ""But it's going to be a big ship. There's a lot of moving parts. They've got a much more pronounced international business, which always is harder."", ""That brings in dollar risk to it as well. So they've got a lot of moving parts. He's got a tough job ahead of them."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And when you talk about positioning in Walgreens Boots, are you short the stock or you're just not investing here."", ""ALEX MORRIS: We're just not in the stock. We're not short it. I mean, as you saw, the charts look similar, [INAUDIBLE] is just a little worse. But we don't think it's a terrible stock. Certainly, it's a profitable business still."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And when you're talking about CVS, you're looking at a longer term play when it comes to that company?"", ""ALEX MORRIS: It's a longer term buy. As you saw, the chart, it's a nice easy curve up and to the right, which is what we want to see. Most of these names, health insurance names, don't get a lot of short-term action. This isn't day trading stock. This is a long-term hold stock."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Got you. All right, well let's sum it all up, shall we? You're telling investors buy CVS. The leadership team drives success it's experiencing growth in its business."", ""On the other side, you say avoid Walgreens as it endures high leadership turnover. It's also experiencing a contraction in its business. Alex Morris, thanks so much."", 'ALEX MORRIS: Thank you.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Good to see you. Thanks for coming in. And that'll do it for the latest installment of Good Buy or Goodbye.""]"

Further, investors can get a double bonus by targeting businesses that should be relevant in a low-interest-rate environment.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With possibly major changes on the way, below are high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A tricky but compelling idea for high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) deserves closer examination. I say it’s tricky because in the past 52 weeks, the performance has been modest, up a bit over 5%. Further, as a restaurant operator, Darden could be vulnerable to the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers could trade down to cheaper sources of nutrition.', 'That said, retail sales for restaurants and other eating places have been robust, soaring since the 2020 doldrums. In all fairness, the metric declined heading into October. However, this dynamic could be due to consumers spending less ahead of a challenging holiday season. Still, if the Fed lowers interest rates, demand for eating establishments could march back higher.', 'Generally speaking, lower rates means lower borrowing costs, which tends to spark hiring. With the labor market stabilized, people may feel comfortable spending their discretionary funds toward nights out. Also, it’s tough to complain about the forward yield of 3.33%, above the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%.', 'Source: Juana Nunez / Shutterstock', 'Another tricky proposition for high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates, Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) is a mountain resort company. Its divided into three divisions, which broadly focus on operating resort properties and providing lodging services to customers. It’s a risky idea because in the past 52 weeks, MTN slipped more than 14%. However, should the Fed go dovish, Vail Resorts could be due for a recovery.', 'To be sure, it’s not that monetary policy directly impacts the mountain resort industry. Further, folks who go skiing at these resorts tend to be higher income. However, the Fed does have a material impact on borrowing costs. And that plays a major role in company’s expansionary endeavors. Also, the opposite dynamic may occur. If borrowing costs rise, enterprises could be looking to cut back.', 'Indeed, throughout much of the post-pandemic period, several companies issued pink slips. However, lower rates may also translate to economic stabilization. If so, demand for entertainment may rise as people feel more comfortable with their discretionary spending. Enticingly, Vail offers a forward yield of 3.81%.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'It’s not the sexiest idea by any means. However, if you’re seeking high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates, IBM (NYSE:IBM) looks awfully attractive. Sure, analysts don’t like it, rating shares a consensus hold. Among 11 expert voices in total, two of them rate IBM stock as a sell. Additionally, the average price target sits at $157.70, implying almost 5% downside risk.', 'By these stats, the legacy tech firm is hardly auspicious. Still, the company offers myriad relevancies, from artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and even the blockchain. And while experts continue to doubt it, that’s also part of its charm. In the past 52 weeks, the security gained over 14%. And in the trailing six months, it’s up almost 24%.', 'While several hedge funds have dumped shares of Big Blue, since the first quarter of last year, there has been a noticeable uptick in acquisitions. One factor that everyone can agree upon is the forward yield of 4%. That’s much higher than the underlying tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Plus, with 28 years of consecutive payout increases, it offers much-needed confidence.', 'Source: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.com', 'A leading global mining group, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) suffered a disappointing performance in 2023. In the past 52 weeks, shares dipped almost 8%. However, analysts are also confident in the company’s comeback potential. While we’re only talking about three expert voices, all of them rate shares a strong buy. Further, the average price target lands at $79.75, implying almost 14% upside potential.', 'That’s not bad considering that the company also offers a forward yield of 5.04%. In addition, the payout ratio comes in at 49.26%, which is reasonable in terms of sustainability. Now, the one immediate cautionary point is that Rio Tinto currently lacks a track record of annual payout increases. Still, the underlying relevance of the business should make RIO one of the high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates.', 'At the core, lower rates usually translate to a devalued dollar. And since commodities are priced in dollars, they should rise. Second, Rio Tinto specializes in several in-demand metals, including lithium and copper. With electric vehicles projected to only rise from here, RIO seems a smart idea for high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'At first glance, the immediate criticism that you could level at Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is its controversy. After all, cigarette smoking lost much of its social cachet. And that relates to the criticism stemming from a second glance: relevance or lack thereof. As myriad studies show, smoking prevalence – both in the U.S. and globally – have fallen significantly. So, why bother with PM?', 'Well, I’ll tell you. Though analog smoking per say has fallen, vaping or e-cigarette use has only accelerated. According to Grand View Research, the global e-cigarette and vape market size may hit $182.84 billion by 2030. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.6% from 2023.', 'To be fair, monetary policy might not have much to say about this industry. However, if borrowing costs decline, PM makes for an enticing idea among high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates. Right now, the company offers a forward yield of 5.46%. Yes, the payout ratio is elevated at 72.62%. Still, by serving a burgeoning growth market, PM seems a compelling opportunity.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Tied to the broader energy infrastructure, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) presents a solid idea for just about any circumstance. Tied to the midstream component of the hydrocarbon value chain, Kinder Morgan specializes in storage and transportation services. While we can talk all day about EVs eventually ruling the roadways, the reality is that for now (and arguably for the foreseeable future), the world runs on oil.', 'In that way, KMI enjoys “job security.” But it’s also an enticing idea for high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates. With lower borrowing costs comes an incentive among enterprises to do something with their money besides sitting on it. Of course, many if not most companies decide to expand, which requires workers. Thus, the increased mobility of people and commerce should boost demand for KMI.', 'While you’re waiting for that narrative to pick up steam, investors can bank on its forward yield of 6.29%. True, its payout ratio is high at 90.53%. But it also enjoys six years of annual dividend increases. And with the always-relevant midstream sector holding up the economy, KMI seems a smart bet.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Probably the riskiest idea among high-yield dividend stocks for falling interest rates, automaker Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) could go either way. Either you’re going to tell me how stupid I am or this could be a 500 IQ play. That’s why I put this name in the last place because I’m not 100% sure where it might go. Still, I am comforted that analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $25.99 price target.', 'One reason that gets me excited about the upside prospects is Stellantis’ Dodge brand. With the iconic nameplate set to launch a Dodge Charge EV – think muscle car looks but with zero emissions – it could change the game. Let’s face it: as great as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is, its design language is boring. With companies like Stellantis (through Dodge) offering consumers choices, STLA could be very interesting in the long run.', 'Also, with reduced borrowing costs, consumers may be willing to consider high-ticket items.

This is Jonathan Edwards. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Bruno, Vice President of Finance.

And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish."", ""Tim Knavish: Thank you, Jonathan, and congratulations on your new role, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, and then I will move to our outlook. In the fourth quarter, the PPG team delivered strong financial results, including record fourth quarter sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.53. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering record sales as we continue to benefit from organic sales growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was 25% higher year-over-year driven by aggregated segment margin improvement of 260 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to be laser-focused on driving margin improvement."", 'Our results reflect our continuing growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantage businesses, which culminated in record fourth quarter sales in the aerospace, automotive OEM and automotive refinish businesses with strong performance in the Protective & Marine and PPG Mexico Architectural Coatings businesses. Our year-over-year sales volume trend improved compared to recent quarters, decreasing less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to experience lower global industrial production along with soft U.S. and European architectural demand, especially for DIY-related products. Notable for us during the quarter was China, where despite a lethargic general economy we achieved high single-digit percentage volume growth, reflecting our strong mix of businesses in the country.', 'In addition, we delivered flat year-over-year volumes in Europe as we see economic stabilization in the region, albeit at lower absolute demand levels. Our selling prices were about 2% higher with both segments delivering positive price led by the Performance Coatings segment. We expect total company selling prices to remain modestly positive in the first quarter of 2024 as new selling price increases have been implemented in several of our businesses. We also benefited from further normalization of our operations as we experienced stabilization of both upstream and downstream supply chains and order patterns. From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have more than sufficient capacity heading into 2024. We started the year laser-focused on margin recovery and the fourth quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement.', 'And as I mentioned, fourth quarter aggregate segment operating margins increased 260 basis points year-over-year and full year increased 310 basis points. We also achieved our second key priority for the year by delivering excellent cash generation of nearly $900 million during the fourth quarter, which was up over $300 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to record full year cash generation of over $2.4 billion. We significantly reduced working capital by a total of about $600 million on a sequential quarterly basis and this includes the benefit from a partial reduction of our inventory levels. However, we still ended the year with higher inventory levels from a historical perspective, primarily in raw materials and will continue to reduce inventory in the first half of 2024.', ""The strong cash generated drove a reduction in net interest expense by about $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we repaid some high variable cost debt during the quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which essentially offset dilution. Now a few comments on the full year 2023. As we communicated at the beginning of 2023, my priorities included margin recovery, strong cash generation and further strengthening of our capabilities to support our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, which will result in higher PPG organic growth. Coming into 2023, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio would prove resilient while anticipating a challenging economic environment, and these clearly played out during the year."", ""For the full year, I'm proud of our team's execution against our strategic objectives as it resulted in delivery of record sales, record adjusted EPS and record operating cash flow. Our sales performance was led by continued selling price execution to offset significant multi-year cost inflation. Our year-over-year earnings growth was driven by these improved selling prices coupled with moderating input costs and cost structure reductions stemming from our cost management and restructuring initiatives. This resulted in improved margins in both segments. Our businesses delivered innovative and value-added products and solutions to our customers, and this enabled several of our businesses to set all-time annual sales records, including our aerospace, auto OEM, automotive refinish, architectural Mexico and the Protective & Marine coatings businesses."", 'Our enterprise growth initiatives delivered about $150 million of incremental sales in the first year, including strong growth from selling our innovative products for electric vehicles, as well as our share gains in powder coatings. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools accelerated yielding nearly 2,000 net body shop wins. These digital tools include our Link Services and moonwalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving bodyshop productivity. In Mexico, we further advanced cross-selling of our valued products, including protective coatings and certain light industrial coatings through the best-in-class distribution network of nearly 5,200 concessionaire locations.', 'Finally, our strong focus on the customer drove share gains across several businesses including expansion of our architectural coatings products at Walmart. Strategically, we conducted an ongoing review of both our product and business portfolios leading to the divestiture of several non-core assets including our European and Australian Traffic Solutions businesses, along with the recently announced strategic alternatives review of the silicas product business. In a variety of cases, we also simplified and improved our product offering, allowing us to reduce complexity and drive down working capital. Finally, these actions plus strong balance sheet management resulted in record full year 2023 cash generation of $2.4 billion. So overall, we achieved excellent financial results in 2023 and are anticipating improving from this higher base in 2024.', ""We remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volume in 2024, including benefits from China, India and Mexico. We've delivered share gains in several businesses, including auto refinish, packaging and the protective and marine coatings businesses. We will also execute on our more than $250 million order backlog in Aerospace drive further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico and further expand the benefits of our key growth initiatives, including powder coatings, electric vehicle products and digital solutions. We will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by the sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives that drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions."", ""Lastly, we entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with the flexibility for further shareholder value creation going forward, including funding organic growth initiatives, appropriate acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Now, I'll comment on our first quarter outlook. We expect to deliver sequential adjusted EPS growth from $1.53 per share in Q4 2023 to a range of $1.80 to $1.87 per share in Q1 of 2024, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. We anticipate global industrial production to remain soft, and our year-over-year sales volume performance will be unfavorably impacted by the approximate $40 million non-recurring Walmart customer load-in that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the timing of the Easter holiday will shift some sales into the second quarter."", 'Despite these difficult year-over-year comparison items, we expect our first quarter sales volume will be flat overall, aided by positive sales volume growth in our aerospace, Protective & Marine and packaging, coatings businesses. We project solid growth in our Auto OEM business in Asia Pacific, where we expect to drive solid volume growth in China, led by our strong positioning with the electric vehicle OEM producers. Additionally, we expect to deliver organic sales growth through our best-in-class Mexico distribution platform. We anticipate overall company selling prices to remain positive, as some modest declines in our industrial reporting segment related to a small portion of customer-based index contracts will be more than offset by targeted selling price increases in our Performance Coatings segment.', 'First quarter comparisons also include declines in certain transitory European and energy-related pricing indices, that were put in place during the period of extremely high energy prices in the region. These particular price declines are offset by lower purchased energy costs for our facility. The net selling price increases, along with various productivity initiatives will serve to offset somewhat higher expected wage inflation in 2024, especially in emerging regions. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs including further recognition of savings stemming from working down, our higher inventories as we progress through 2024. We will diligently manage our costs and expect to deliver manufacturing and productivity gains supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order patterns.', 'We anticipate more moderate year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter associated with some of the transitory items, I mentioned earlier. However, we are confident that we will deliver our commitment for full year earnings growth of around 10% at our forecast guidance midpoint. Finally, I want to thank our more than 50,000 employees for making it happen by delivering excellent 2023 financial results and positioning the company for growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond for the benefit of all stakeholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions.', 'See also 11 High Growth Low/No Dividend Stocks to Buy and 18 High Growth Low PE Stocks.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

For the press tour following the record-breaking release of Greta Gerwig’s award-winning, acclaimed Barbie movie, producer and star Margot Robbie and her stylist Andrew Mukamal immersed themselves in some of Barbie’s most iconic outfits and curated vintage pieces, then approached designers, from Giorgio Armani to Donatella Versace, to create looks inspired by the doll-size originals. Many of these looks were not seen as the official Barbie press tour was cut short—so Margot and Andrew worked with renowned fashion photographer Craig McDean to shoot her in the looks exactly as they were curated: Schiaparelli in Los Angeles, Vivienne Westwood in London, vintage Chanel with matching Streamline luggage at the airport, and beyond.', '""This book is the culmination of tens of thousands of hours of work by some of the most talented and creative visionaries and designers on Earth,"" says Mukamal.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.15 = US$6.0b ÷ (US$50b - US$8.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Netflix has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Entertainment industry average of 9.6% it's much better."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Netflix ', ""In the above chart we have measured Netflix's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Netflix."", ""Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Netflix. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 141%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 17%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business' underlying economics, which is great to see."", ""A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Netflix has. Since the stock has returned a solid 48% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist."", ""Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Armed with this insight, here are five blue chip dividend growth stocks that are near locks to make you richer over time.', '1. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the leading big box retailer in the U.S., with annual sales expected to surpass $666 billion in 2025 and a network of 4,622 stores across the country as of now.\xa0Walmart also has a strong presence in the global market and a high demand for its Walmart+ subscription service, making it a key competitor in the online retail space.', ""The company has been paying and increasing its dividend every year since 1974. In the last 10 years, Walmart has raised its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 1.94%. The retail giant's current yield is 1.4%, which is decent for a large-cap company still in growth mode. Its dividend is also sustainable, evidenced by its low payout ratio of 37.7%."", ""Walmart may not offer impressive dividend growth or yield, but it does have a commendable track record of regular increases to its payout. The company's solid competitive advantage also provides shareholders with an all-important margin of safety."", '2. Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) has been pushing the boundaries of biotech innovation since 1980. The company was among the first to successfully develop and market biologically based medicines, an industry that has grown into a $511 billion-plus market and continues to expand by double digits every year.', ""Amgen has boosted the size of its dividend checks every year since 2011, and its 10-year dividend growth rate stands at a blistering 13.9%. The biotech currently offers an above-average yield of 2.92%. Amgen's generous dividend also screens as safe, given its modest payout ratio of 59.2%, robust top-line growth prospects (estimated 15.8% growth in 2024), and management's commitment to rewarding loyal shareholders."", '3. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is a leading producer and distributor of beverages and snacks worldwide. The company owns many well-known brands, such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Doritos, Cheetos, and more. PepsiCo has a strong track record of dividend growth, with 51 years of consecutive increases and a 10-year dividend growth rate of 8.2%. The company offers a solid 2.98% annualized yield, but its payout ratio of 80.5% is somewhat elevated. However, PepsiCo is delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth currently, which should sustain its top-notch dividend policy.', ""4. Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is the world's largest pure-play medical device company. It sports leading positions in several high-growth markets, such as cardiac care, diabetes management, neurostimulation, and minimally invasive surgery. Medtronic has also demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders with a remarkable 46-year streak of dividend increases."", ""Over the last 10 years, the company has raised its dividend by an average of 9% annually. Moreover, Medtronic offers a solid 3.19% yield at current prices.

Altria (NYSE: MO) is a leading tobacco company in the U.S. that enjoys a dominant market position. On the dividend side of the ledger, the tobacco giant offers a generous yield of almost 10%.

Deidre Woollard caught up with Karl to get some takeaways from the recent JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, where healthcare and biotech companies tell investors what they're up to. Deidre and Karl discuss how Vertex Pharmaceuticals could change pain medication, why winners will probably keep on winning in the weight loss drug space, and a cancer treatment that's frustrating investors."", ""Deidre Woollard: Something that happened last year, the big story of GLP-1 drugs and diabetes care reinvigorated, it seemed to me the whole space in general. That's probably overstating things, but you saw these companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, they had this monster year. They couldn't get these drugs out fast enough. Every time I turn on the TV, somebody is offering a new service, trying to get these drugs out. This seems like an overnight success, but this is like a two-decade story. What is happening in this space?"", ""Karl Thiel: Well, it's interesting you say that it's a two-decade story because I don't think many people appreciate that. The first GLP drug that came out was a drug called Byetta. It was actually, created by a company called Amylin and Lily bought them. Eli Lilly was in it from the very beginning. That was 2005. Iterations ago, that drug was not nearly as good as what's on the market now. But even Ozempic has been on the market since 2017. You see that what's happened in the past year or so, a lot of it's word of mouth and it's surprising how important that can be to a drug. Even when all the data is there, its social media chatter if you look at it, was basically nil on these drugs until around mid-2021 and then, or early 2021, and then kind of went asymptotic in mid-2022 as people just started steamrolling on what these drugs could do and how amazing it is. Frankly, that data came out saying that not only do these drugs help you lose weight, but they might actually be cardioprotective. They might actually help with things like heart disease, where in the past a lot of weight loss drugs have been pulled off the market because they ended up actually doing some damage to the heart."", 'Deidre Woollard: Yeah. I do remember the whole fen-phen controversy.', ""Karl Thiel: Right. Then that's just one of them. But yeah, absolutely."", ""Deidre Woollard: Tell us a little bit more about what else is happening because it's not just these two companies anymore, right?"", ""Karl Thiel: It's not just these two companies. In fact, and from an investor viewpoint, it can be a little frustrating because there are so many people now chasing after this that, it can be really hard to tell who the winners are going to be. GLP-1 as a target is not something that any one company can own. They can own the specific chemicals that interact with that target, but they can't own the target. Lots of people are going after it. You've seen some interesting deals in the space. There's a company, Structure Therapeutics, that went public despite there being an almost complete freeze on IPOs because of interest in their drug in the space. You saw a big acquisition for another company called Cayman around that. But if I had to look out there and say, who's got some of the most interesting stuff going, you're going to have to look to, I think, some of the bigger players. Because if there's one thing we saw, it's that if you're successful in this, even a big company like Lily or Novo Nordisk can't keep up with demand. They've already put a huge amount of investment into the manufacturing that can be used for these drugs and potentially for successor drugs. I would say that the incumbents are doing a lot to keep themselves in the lead even though there are other companies that are likely to come along and likely to be other successes and more deal-making. Honestly, that's what we want in the end. You're looking for incremental improvements in the drugs. You're looking for enough competition, hopefully, to push prices down."", ""That would be a good thing. But if there's one company that I think is interesting in this area, people are talking about Amgen a fair bit because they have a drug called, well, people are calling it Mary Tide because the full name is a little cumbersome to pronounce. But it is a dual mechanism of action drug. It's a GLP drug, but it also has another gastric inhibitory mechanism of action. They're trying to address, and I think this is going to be a real discussion over the next few years, which is that, these drugs, they're great, they take a lot of weight off. But now what? Do you stay on them forever? All indications are as soon as you go off them, the benefits of them are gone. Is it OK to stay on them for a decade, for two decades? That's not really been studied very much, nor has it been studied if there's ways to wean you off them. There's a lot of questions, and people are also concerned about things that are along the lines of if you lose this much body weight, a lot of it's going to be muscle not just fat. There's a lot of issues. I think one thing that Amgen is really hoping they have is a differentiated drug in that they're hoping for one thing, that it can be dosed out less frequently, which would be a modest, convenient thing. But they also are hoping that it will have a longer maintenance period of effectiveness, possibly even after you stop using it, and that's very much still to be determined, but they're investing big in the area and there should be data later this year. That's going to be an exciting thing I think to watch out for."", 'Deidre Woollard: When I saw that Nvidia CEO came to the conference and they have a relationship with Amgen. I think anywhere that Jensen Huang goes, interest tends to follow.', ""Karl Thiel: Yeah. This is a meeting where the very biggest companies are completely dwarfed by the size of a trillion dollar company like Nvidia striding into the room. It associates biotech with one of the biggest buzzwords of the last year, which is AI. That's exactly what he was there for. Amgen was one of the early adopters of Nvidia 's BioNeMo platform, which is basically, it's a set of APIs and other tools for plugging into their supercomputing to do biological generative AI. But what they announced at the meeting was a much broader partnership. It's built on Amgen's deCODE arm. That's a whole story in and of itself that I probably shouldn't go into, but it's fascinating. deCODE Genetics was once an independent company. It's an Icelandic company that existed for reasons just unique to what Iceland is all about. Amgen ended up buying them and they have all of this unique data. They've since expanded well beyond the Icelandic population so that they have deep data on millions of people. That is something that Amgen can plug into this generative AI platform and see where it goes. This is very early, but it's just interesting to see that Amgen is, I think, in a way, taking it more seriously, or at least publicly more seriously than a lot of other companies. It's a space where you can't just muscle your way into calculating the perfect molecule, the physical space. There's too many possibilities. Even the biggest supercomputers would take millions of years to calculate all the possibilities that you could have for molecules to bind. But with generative AI, it's possible that there's a lot of things you could really speed up and it remains to be seen. But it's really interesting to watch Jensen Huang get up on stage and talk about this partnership with Amgen and where it could go."", ""Deidre Woollard: Wow, we're definitely going to have to keep track of that one. Going back to the GLP-1 drugs. When they first came out, everyone said, well, this is going to be terrible for the continuous glucose monitors. Nobody's going to need those anymore. It's all going to be solved. That isn't the case. I was listening to the Dexcom presentation and, it's interesting because they talk about the situation of course, more than one in four healthcare dollars spent on diabetes. But they introduced this Stelo which is for people that aren't on insulin and it's for type 2 diabetes. They actually talked about working with the GLP-1 drug therapy. This is really interesting. Is this going to be a platform beyond just type 1 diabetes management now?"", ""Karl Thiel: Yeah. First, it's important to point out that Dexcom traditionally serve people with type 1 diabetes where you're dependent on insulin and that is not related to weight loss in any way, that does not impact the course of that disease. That business is unfortunately, I guess, safe for them, but they also have a big business in helping people who do have type 2 diabetes. You could theorize that that will be impacted by some of these GLP-1 drugs. The Stelo platform is really interesting. Just announced the idea is that you can be not on insulin, so you're not really using it as a paired insulin pump. What you're really doing is you're monitoring your blood sugar to figure out how to do things, how to eat in ways that are going to work better. That's something you could use in conjunction with the GLP-1 drug. It's something that could possibly use to maybe help people wean off these in a more effective way down the line. It's really smart planning on their part. It's too early to say where the product itself goes. It's a little bit aimed at the idea that, I forget the wording that they used, but they implied that this might be something that you could even get without a prescription. That it's consumer aimed and meant to be relatively affordable. The health gadget space that has taken off in many ways, they could tap into some of that."", ""Deidre Woollard: I wanted to also touch on Alzheimer's disease drugs because that was another big thing that they talked about. A lot of the conference and some of the presentations, they talked about the difference between, in the past, the drugs were just to treat the symptoms and now they're getting deeper into catching it faster and maybe slowing the progression. It seems like there's a shift in the way that we consider Alzheimer's disease treatment in general now."", ""Karl Thiel: This is Biogen's second Alzheimer's drug. Their first one was called Aduhelm. It did get approval, it was very controversial. They pulled it off the market because basically nobody would pay for it. The impact of the drug was weak enough and the price high enough that essentially nobody was willing to reimburse for it. But Leqembi, the newer drug, has, I think a stronger case to make. In fact, they're saying that the insurance reimbursement is not an issue for them. They've got a full approval that opens them up to Medicare reimbursement, which is obviously critical for a age related disease like this or an age correlated disease like this. I think what's interesting is that the amyloid hypothesis, the idea that by reducing amyloid plaque, you're going to change the course of Alzheimer's. It makes a lot of sense on a surface level, but the idea was all but hanging by a thread a couple of years ago because drug after drug showed that it could reduce amyloid plaque and it was not impacting the course of disease and so people were giving up on this idea. That Aduhelm changed that a little bit. Now I think Leqembi and Lily's Donanemab that's in progress I think has gotten this back. But part of it is the idea that, yes, it can have an impact on disease, but it might be important the earlier you can intervene might become more and more critical and so that's certainly an area that they're looking at with this."", ""Deidre Woollard: Yeah, and I think that's interesting because GE Healthcare, which is of course a spin off from General Electric, they have this new way of imaging the Alzheimer's brain to try to detect those amyloid plaques. Because it does seem like it's all about getting in as soon as possible. I know on the Lily presentation they also talked about that the donanemab probably murdered that pronunciation, but that if people take it earlier, sometimes they can reduce the potential of getting it. It seems like there's all these different ways that companies are coming at this right now."", ""Karl Thiel: Yeah and in fact, there's some late stage clinical work being done on the basis of using these essentially as preventative drugs. Now, the way they're enrolling the trials is that you have to have no measurable cognition decline so you're asymptomatic, but you do have amyloid plaque and so why would you know that you had amyloid plaque if you're not having any symptoms? Well, it's because you're considered to be a very high risk patient for reasons of genetics or family. Those are going to be really interesting studies. I mean that could make a huge difference if you find that these do changed the course of illness. Now those are by definition have to be fairly long term studies in order to be able to see that. We're talking about results in like 2027, I think Biogen or really Eisai, which is the senior partner with Leqembi, I think they're talking 2026. They're hoping to submit. But you still a ways off before we see much about that."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, there were so many companies that presented at the conference. I think I have listened to maybe 10 presentations just for anybody listening. If you are invested in any biotech company, go look on their investor page, see if they present it, because they may have it. It's really interesting. But there's a few that I wanted to talk about with you that I know a lot of people are curious about what's happening and one of them is Moderna. I did this interview with Bethany McLean who wrote Big Fail. She was talking about Moderna going from a teenager to an adult, as a company during the pandemic and so you've got a company that's in an interesting spot. Vaccine, revenue declining. It's got the RSV vaccine that it's bringing out, but then it's also trying to build this pathway with maybe a combination vaccine and more vaccines in the future. How are you thinking about Moderna now?"", ""Karl Thiel: I think they're really interesting. I thought it was interesting that Stéphane Bancel was not actually at the meeting. It was one of their senior executives that was there. I don't know what the story is there, but there's a couple of companies I think about in this space obviously. When you think about the two vaccines for COVID, there was Moderna and there was Pfizer. But Pfizer's technology really came from a company called BioNTech or BioNTech, I guess is how they pronounce it. I think those two companies are really interesting. They both have a lot of core IP in this mRNA space and they're taking two different paths. Moderna is really doubling down on the vaccine business and so that's a little tough because right now everybody's is waiting to find the bottom in COVID vaccine sales. They came in with I think, 6.1 billion in actual vaccine sales in 2023. Not counting some deferred payments, which is, that's a great business going forward if they can maintain that. They're only guiding for $4,000,000,000 this year. They expect it to start growing again in 2025. Well, with that base, you can fund a whole lot of research. They have a very rich pipeline. Their RSV drug, I think is interesting. I also think it's a little bit tough because they're going to be third to the market with an RSV vaccine. There are already two that got approved this past May, one from Pfizer, one from GSK. Neither of those are mRNA vaccines, so there is different, but I haven't. It looks similarly effective like there's not an immediate advantage that you would see now. I may be not fully informed on that, but I think it's going to be a little bit of heavy lifting for them coming into the market. Obviously they're working on flu vaccines which would really make sense if you can get that in a combination with a COVID shot, that would certainly help them break into the flu market, which is that's a sizable market that's led by Sanofi right now. Yeah, I think they're in a good position. I would really love to see them have some successes in the cancer space, in some areas outside of traditional yearly vaccines as well. That would, I think, just get people more excited about the platform. That's a little bit more where BioNTech has focused."", ""Deidre Woollard: I think for Moderna, that's probably a way off. You mentioned cancer, which is a good segue to talk about Novocure. This one is interesting because it's such a journey in the market. One of our biotech analyst was talking about it the other day and he started with this huge sigh because this is, the technology is interesting. It uses these tumor treating fields to treat cancer. But it's really disappointed investors, some of the initial trials weren't as promising as people were hoping. What happened and what should we be thinking about this business now?"", ""Karl Thiel: I just resisted sighing myself. I'm a shareholder in Novocure, I believe in the technology, I think it's pretty amazing and for better or worse, they are going it alone. Like nobody else is really in this area. They have all the IP around the space and as far as I know, nobody else is really even trying to do this. The idea is that you put a tumor within an electric field, basically you stop the cells from dividing successfully. It messes up the way they align when they divide, and they basically just split and die. This is amply shown to work right in glioblastoma, which is the most common form of brain cancer. The challenge with this is that to work you should really wear the device 24/7 all the time. That's when people who do that or come very close to that, have a really huge survival advantage over people who don't. But even if you wear it half the time, you do get some survival advantage of doing this. The idea has been they can tune the frequency to any type of cancer cell, so it should work broadly. What happened is they had two different things happen in 2023 which are unrelated. One was that they had the results of their lung cancer study. This was really awaited, because it's so much of a bigger market than brain cancer. The study was successful. It did show that it worked, but when you looked at how the study was conducted, basically standards of care had changed while the study was ongoing. They answered a question that nobody was asking anymore."", ""Even though I think their plan is they've already submitted for approval of the device in lung cancer, they plan to launch it late this year, and they have a whole campaign, they think that they can buy in for it. I think everybody is thinking it's going to be a real uphill climb to get people to prescribe it because it doesn't if they don't have the data to show that it helps in exactly the way that lung cancer is treated now. They are doing that study to have a more of an apples to apples case to make. But that study is not going to be done for several years. That was the first one. But it was still no knock on the technology which seemed still to work really well. Then the second thing happened was their ovarian cancer trial and that one just straight up failed. It's hard to know why. They do have to tune this to the frequency of each tumor cell type and for whatever reason it didn't seem to work there. That gets people really nervous about what's coming next. There are a number of key events this year."", ""Deidre Woollard: They have enough cash, they've got runway. But I think is it that investors are wondering if the business is smaller than anticipated? If it maybe doesn't work for all cancers?"", ""Karl Thiel: Yeah. Well, part of it is that the glioblastoma business, it produces about $500 million a year in revenue. It's a fine business and it's something that if they wanted that to be their only business, they could make that profitable. It's just that has not grown, that has just flat lined. They're not showing much success in getting beyond 40% market penetration. There's really no reason for that. There's a convenience aspect with the treatment, but they really should be able to get more people on that therapy, and so there's a question about why can't they do that. Now with lung if that's not going to really be able to hit in the market and ovarian failed, all of a sudden you start looking at this as a much less interesting company. They need a win. The stock is languishing and I think it's going to continue to languish until they have some win. This late this quarter, they're going to have the top line results of their medicine study, which is looking at brain metastasis from lung cancer. We'll see how they do there."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk about another V company. Let's talk about Vertex, because this is what I know a lot of people are watching. It's got that core business of cystic fibrosis and now it also sickle cell disease. But the thing that I found interesting is where they might be going, because they talked about two huge opportunities. A neuropathic pain, a non opioid, a solution for neuropathic pain, and Type I diabetes. Think about where this company is now and where it might be going. Is it as big as they say it could be?"", ""Karl Thiel: Yeah. Everybody obviously focuses on the cystic fibrosis business which has driven this company, it's fantastic. Few companies dominate one disease area as much as Vertex does in cystic fibrosis. They've been incredible about developing therapies that address more and more of the various genetic versions of this disease you can have. It's been great for patients as well as shareholders I think. Then a lot of attention was put on their efforts in gene editing and sickle cell disease. I always saw this pain drug, is this like lottery ticket sitting there. Whenever you have studies in this area, it always makes me nervous because it comes down to how people feel. It's like a lot of studies of antidepressants, you put people on a placebo and oftentimes they'll feel better. What you'll often find is that like, yeah, the drug seemed to work on an absolute basis. They felt better after they took it than they did before they did, but so does the placebo group, and pain isn't quite like that, but there's a similar element to it."", ""So I was always worried. But as more data comes along, I'm starting to actually feel much more hopeful about this drug. They had their initial phase II work was in basically pain relief after like a bunion removal or a tummy tuck, things like that. So acute use, you're going to use it for a little while while you recover. But the data that they came out with in December was looking at peripheral nerve pain from associated with diabetes. This is a chronic use drug. Obviously a chronic use market is going to be a bigger deal for them. It looked like it wasn't a head to head study. You can't really say anything definitive, but it seemed to perform actually somewhat better than the drug Lyrica, which is widely used in this market. Beyond that, the whole appeal of this drug is that by its very mechanism of action, it should really have zero addictive properties. Lyrica is not a terribly addictive drug either, but it is a scheduled drug. It's a schedule five controlled substance. More than that it's associated with waking and some dizziness and there's certain people who just don't seem to respond to it. It's not going to take on the biggest heavy weight pain, but it could be a really significant drug for them. It's very exciting."", ""Mary Long: As always, people in the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

This increase is in sync with the company’s previously announced annual dividend growth rate target of 7-9% per share.This increase resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.63 per share compared with the previous level of $1.51. NRG Energy’s current dividend yield is 2.88%, higher than the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's average of 1.36%."", 'In the past few years, NRG Energy has made significant progress in its transformation to an integrated power company. It sells electricity to a wide variety of customers and none of them contributed more than 10% to the company’s revenues. Courtesy of its high-quality services, the company has been able to retain customers and does not depend on a single customer to generate revenues. This adds stability and predictability to customer bills and NRG’s earnings.Recently, the company completed the sale of its 44% equity interest in South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (“STP”) to Constellation Energy Corporation for $1.75 billion. STP is a 2,645-megawatt nuclear facility located about 90 miles southwest of Houston in Bay City, TX. The net proceeds from the transaction will further enable NRG to reduce debts and increase shareholders’ value.The company is focused on clean generation to lower emissions.

(NYSE:NEE), the world's largest producer of renewable energy from solar and wind power, had a forgettable 2023 in the stock market with the stock losing more than 30% of its market value. This disappointing performance came on the back of rising interest rates and its subsidiary, NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP), slashing limited partnership distribution per unit growth to 6% through 2026 from a high of 13.5% previously."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NEE.', 'The underperformance of NextEra stock in 2023 should not have come as a surprise to prudent investors who keep tabs on market trends. Historically, utilities have performed poorly when interest rates rise, and there was no exception this time around. In the last 12 months, the S&P 500 utilities sector has lost more than 12%, making it the worst-performing sector in the index.', ""On the back of this lackluster performance in 2023, many utilities stocks have entered the cheaply valued territory. NextEra Energy is one such company, and even more interestingly, it seems well-positioned for a notable turnaround this year. NextEra's attractive dividend, reasonable valuation and the improving odds for a rate cut this year make the company a top contrarian play for 2024."", ""To understand NextEra's appeal as a long-term investment, investors need to dig deep to evaluate the different business segments of the company in detail."", ""Florida Power & Light, NextEra's regulated utility business in Florida, enjoys a near monopoly in its market as it is the largest rate-regulated utility in the state. This gives the company meaningful control in the state with FPL enjoying exclusive rights to charge customers prices that enable it to earn returns that exceed its cost of capital."", 'FPL enjoys a favorable regulatory environment in Florida and the company, historically, has been on the right side of regulatory decisions. As a regulated utility, maintaining a healthy relationship with policymakers is key to long-term success, and the company has shown its commitment to building and maintaining an open line of communication with key regulators in the region.', ""NextEra's renewable energy business, conducted through NextEra Energy Resources, is well-positioned to capture the lucrative opportunity in the clean energy space, which is another reason to be bullish about its prospects. The company has a 31-gigawatt operating portfolio and a development pipeline of approximately 300 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. Energy Resources aims to benefit significantly from the expected growth of renewable energy's share in the U.S. power generation mix."", ""According to the International Energy Agency, renewables will contribute to more than 80% of new power generation capacity by 2030, with solar power accounting for more than half of it. NextEra's renewable business will play a key role in helping the U.S. achieve these lofty expectations. The company's existing solar power assets will prove to be indispensable in the long run, which paints a promising picture of what the future holds for NextEra."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, Energy Resources reported its best renewables and storage origination ever, adding over 3,200 megawatts to the backlog. This demonstrates the strong demand for new renewable generation today, and how NextEra is making the most of this robust demand. There is visibility into the company's renewable energy growth, as evident from the continued growth of the pipeline. This eliminates some of the uncertainty associated with expected growth."", 'The company is carrying out strategic investments to improve the efficiency of its renewable energy business. A couple of months ago, NextEra announced a strategic plan to repower approximately 740 megawatts of wind facilities through 2026 by investing in existing projects to enhance performance, refresh equipment and secure new production tax credits. When these planned investments are executed, the renewable energy business will be substantially more efficient than it is today, which should pave the way for higher returns on deployed capital.', ""The company's battery storage business is another bright spot. The company added roughly 250 megawatts of standalone battery storage projects co-located with existing wind and solar facilities to its backlog in the third quarter. This focus on battery storage aligns with the growing need for energy capacity and the ability to provide grid support."", 'Overall, NextEra Energy is a well-managed business with the potential to tap into a few key growth areas in the coming years. With the Fed expected to cut rates this year, the market sentiment toward renewable energy companies and utilities should improve in the coming months, paving the way for NextEra stock to erase recent losses.', 'With interest rates shooting through the roof, investors have increasingly turned skeptical about the balance sheet health of NextEra Energy. Utilities companies often carry a substantial debt burden on their balance sheets as regular infrastructure development investments are required to build and maintain capacity. NextEra currently carries $59 billion in long-term debt, which may seem daunting in isolation. The bigger picture reveals a different story.', 'The company is committed to maintaining financial discipline and passing on projects that do not meet investment return expectations. Management has pledged to keep the total equity capital need below $3 billion through 2026, which is encouraging at a time when the market is turning cautious about its liquidity profile.', 'NextEra Energy Partners, on the other hand, is focused on executing its transition plan, which includes selling assets and managing equity buyouts. The current expectation is for distributions per unit growth of 6% through 2026, which is still attractive despite being lower than initial projections.', 'As one of the largest clean energy companies in the world, NextEra enjoys access to substantial capital through its strong relationships with global banks. The company, arguably, has one of the strongest balance sheets in the U.S. clean energy sector today.', 'NextEra pays a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share, which translates to an annual yield of 3.2%. The current payout ratio of around 60% makes its dividend relatively safe, and the company is unlikely to face any material challenges in maintaining this dividend should earnings decline in the short term before rebounding.', ""The company has projected stable earnings per share growth through 2026 despite the unfavorable interest rate environment, driven by the strong demand for clean energy. Favorable demographic trends in Florida, underpinned by population growth, should benefit the company's rate-regulated business as well. Robust earnings growth, in the long run, should help NextEra boost dividend distributions."", 'With the Fed lining up to put an end to its aggressive rate hike regime, market sectors that are highly sensitive to interest rates seem well-positioned to perform well this year. The utilities sector stands out as one of the biggest potential winners of rate cuts, and NextEra Energy is a top pick in this sector. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 18, the company is reasonably valued with a promising pipeline that points toward stellar earnings growth in the long run.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

On behalf of our 6,000+ Georgia employees, it is an honor to deliver this Georgia-built, Georgia-flown aircraft to Savannah\'s 165th Airlift Wing,"" said Rod McLean, vice president and general manager for Lockheed Martin\'s Air Mobility & Maritime Missions line of business and its Marietta production site.\xa0""The addition of the C-130J Super Hercules, the most advanced Hercules ever produced,\xa0to the Georgia Air National Guard\'s fleet enables its crews deliver hope and help ―\xa0all over the world for many years to come.""', 'The 165th Airlift Wing has the distinction of operating the first all-C-130J-30 Super Hercules fleet in Georgia. Its crews will rely on the C-130J-30 — the stretch version of the C-130J that adds 15 feet of cargo space ― to support strategic and tactical airlift mission requirements.', '""Marty, the girls and I are grateful for the service and dedication of the men and women of the Georgia Air National Guard every day,"" Gov. Brian Kemp said. ""Today\'s delivery of a\xa0C-130J-30 Super Hercules means our brave servicemembers will now fly the most advanced Hercules aircraft in history, proudly built right here in the State of Georgia at Lockheed Martin\'s historic Marietta manufacturing facility. I\'m proud the longest continuously produced military aircraft in American history is now both Georgia-built and Georgia-flown, supporting our state\'s continued growth as a national leader in military, defense and aerospace.""', ""The C-130J Super Hercules is Georgia's aerospace ambassador to the world, with almost\xa02.7 million flight hours and a $2 billion annual investment into the Georgia economy, which includes 18 Georgia-based suppliers."", '""I join with Maj. Gen. Carden, Maj. Gen. Crumbly, the Lockheed Martin team, IAM Local 709 and the entire community in celebrating the delivery of this new C-130J for our Georgia Air National Guard. In 2022, Sen. Warnock and I added funding for 16 new C-130J aircraft and an additional 16 in 2023. I will continue to champion the C-130J program in Congress, and this new aircraft will help our National Guard defend the United States,"" U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff said.', 'This delivery marks the first U.S. Air Force C-130J-30 aircraft to receive the Block 8.1 configuration during its initial production. The Block 8.1 configuration improves interoperability across the fleet with features such as a new flight management system, enhanced navigation and inter-communication systems and updated friend-or-foe identification.', '""Since I came to Congress, I have fiercely advocated for increased C-130 procurement, due to its importance in strengthening our national security. The C-130J Super Hercules is the most capable airlifter in the world. Every aircraft made represents the hard work of 5,500 Georgians at Lockheed Martin\'s Marietta facility located right here in the 11th Congressional District,""\xa0U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (GA-11) said. ""This new aircraft also represents a major increase in capability for the men and women of Georgia\'s Air National Guard, who will now count the most advanced C-130 ever built as part of its newest fleet. I want to thank Georgia Adjutant\xa0General Thomas Carden for his partnership in securing this major victory for Georgia and our nation.""', 'The U.S. Air National Guard, which has one of the most visible and active C-130 fleets in the world, continues to operate a mixed C-130J and C-130H fleet. The addition of the C-130J-30 Super Hercules to the Air National Guard fleet ensures these crews will continue to support the Guard\'s motto of ""Always Ready, Always There"" for decades to come.', '""The future is now, and the Georgia National Guard is more prepared than ever to answer the call with the cutting-edge, C-130J Super Hercules-enabled airlift. I\'m so proud of the Airmen at 165th Airlift Wing and thankful to all those our who have worked tirelessly to make this happen,"" said Maj. Gen. Tom Carden, adjutant general of the Georgia Department of Defense.', 'The C-130J Super Hercules is the proven standard in tactical airlift, providing a unique mix of versatility and performance to complete any mission, anytime, anywhere.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on PulteGroup PHM, Dream Finders Homes DFH and Granite Construction GVA.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Leidos Holdings, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil, and health markets. Renewed strength in the aerospace sector provides a durable backing for this industry leader. LDOS stock has begun to display relative strength, recently surging to 52-week highs. Increasing volume has attracted investor attention as buying pressure accumulates in this top-ranked stock.', 'LDOS is part of the Zacks Aerospace – Defense industry group, which currently ranks in the top 25% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.', 'Quantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. It’s no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.', 'Leidos Holdings offers national security solutions and systems for air, land, sea, space, and cyberspace for the U.S. Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as other government agencies and military services. The company is a technology leader in areas such as cybersecurity, data analytics, and logistics.', 'In addition, Leidos Holdings provides IT solutions in cloud computing, mobility, data center management, and help desk operations. The company boasts a wide array of customers including foreign governments and their agencies, which are primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and Australia.', 'Increased contract wins for Leidos from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies have been a primary growth driver for the company. In the third quarter of last year, Leidos recorded net bookings worth $7.9 billion. This led to an impressive backlog of $38.04 billion, a solid increase relative to the $34.15 billion from the year-ago period.', 'The diversified defense provider has put together an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in October of last year, the company reported third-quarter earnings of $2.03/share, a 23.8% surprise over the $1.64/share consensus estimate. Leidos Holdings has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.5%.', 'LDOS shares received a boost as analysts covering the company have been increasing their 2024 earnings estimates lately. For the full year, earnings estimates have risen 0.4% in the past 60 days. The 2024 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $7.48/share, reflecting a potential growth rate of 6.3% relative to the prior year. Revenues are projected to climb 4.2% to $15.89 billion.', 'LDOS stock has advanced more than 40% in the past eight months alone. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to experience this type of outperformance. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.', 'Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs, widely outperforming the major indices. With positive fundamental and technical indicators, LDOS stock is poised to continue its outperformance.', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Leidos Holdings has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and LDOS continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.', 'Despite the impressive performance, LDOS stock remains relatively undervalued based on traditional valuation metrics:', 'Leidos is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Scores, with a best-in-class ‘A’ rating in our Growth category and a second-best ‘B’ rating in our Value category. This indicates that LDOS stock is likely to move higher based on a favorable combination of earnings/sales growth and undervaluation.', 'Backed by a top industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Robust fundamentals combined with an appealing technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock.', 'Nabors Industries provides drilling and related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells in the United States and internationally. The company offers solutions such as tubular running, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, and drilling optimization software. Nabors Industries markets approximately 300 rigs for land-based drilling operations and 29 rigs for offshore platform operations.', 'The Hamilton, Bermuda-based company provides several intelligent products including ROCKit and SmartSLIDE, which are two advanced directional steering control systems; SmartNAV, a collaborative guidance and advisory platform; and RigCLOUD, which provides the infrastructure to deliver real-time insight into operations across its rig fleet.', 'Despite a relatively constructive operating environment, the oilfield services provider continues to be exposed to overcapacity and pricing pressure. Its rig count is down since the start of 2023, and customers seem to be drilling fewer wells. Volatile crude oil prices are likely to persist in 2024, and a high debt-to-capitalization ratio restricts the company’s financial flexibility.', 'Nabors Industries, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Oil and Gas – Drilling industry group. This industry ranks in the bottom 5% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the past several months.', 'Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential candidates for short positions. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they are part of a lackluster industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.', 'Despite a rebound in stocks with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting new all-time highs, NBR shares have not been participating lately. The stock has experienced considerable volatility over the past year. NBR hit a 52-week low earlier this month, all while the general market eclipses its former highs.', 'NBR has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. The company most recently reported a fiscal third-quarter loss in October 2023 of -$5.40/share, missing the -$0.20/share consensus EPS estimate by a whopping -2,600%.', 'Nabors Industries has posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -817.39%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and NBR is no exception.', 'The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. The fourth-quarter outlook has been slashed by -105.26% in the past 60 days. The fiscal Q4 Zack Consensus Estimate stands at -$0.78/share, the second consecutive (expected) loss in what has been a consistent string of misses.', 'Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.', 'As illustrated below, NBR stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling pressure in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.', 'NBR stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Nabors Industries would have to make a surprising move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. NBR shares have fallen more than 56% in the past year alone, all while the major indexes have shown strength.', 'A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that NBR stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.', 'Highlighted underperformance bodes well for the bears. Potential investors may want to consider including this stock as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of NBR shares until the situation shows major signs of improvement.', 'U.S. homebuilders’ sentiment soared for the second successive month in January. The Housing Market Index of the National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”), which determines homebuilders’ confidence in newly constructed single-family houses, increased to 44 in January from December’s reading of 37. The reading came in better than the 39 estimated by economists. Also, it’s more than the year-ago reading of 35.', 'Homebuilders have successfully trimmed prices and provided various other incentives to attract buyers and improve sales. The NAHB reported that nearly 31% of homebuilders cut prices in January. Nonetheless, builders think that the current sales scenario is buoyant, while they are hopeful about forthcoming sales prospects for the first time since August. Builders are, at the moment, witnessing an uptick in traffic among potential buyers.', 'The decline in mortgage rates since late October has also bolstered homebuilders’ confidence, per Freddie Mac. The 30-year mortgage rate is hovering below the 7% mark and is at its lowest level in three weeks. This decline in mortgage rates lifted home-buying and demand for refinancing. On the other hand, mortgage application volume picked up last week.', 'Mortgage rates continue to ease on expectations of a series of interest rate cuts this year. This is because mortgage rates always tend to follow the Federal Reserve’s funds rate. Now, with inflationary pressure showing signs of cooling down, the Fed is widely expected to trim interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool is now showing that 53.8% of market participants are expecting a rate cut in March’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.', 'Lest we forget, economic activity in the housing market has already picked up, with construction spending increasing for the 11th month in November. The Commerce Department reported that construction outlays increased 0.4% to $2.04 trillion in November.', 'Thus, with the housing market warming up, homebuilding and construction stocks such as PulteGroup, Dream Finders Homes and Granite Construction are making compelling investment choices as of now. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'PulteGroup engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. PHM currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next-year earnings has moved up 0.6% over the past 60 days. PHM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 6.4%.', 'Dream Finders Homes is a homebuilding company. It operates principally in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Virginia and Maryland. DFH currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 5.5% over the past 60 days.

NRG announced that its board of directors has approved an 8% increase in its quarterly dividend rate. The new dividend rate will be 40.75 cents per share compared with the previous quarter’s 37.75 cents, payable on Feb 15, 2024, to stockholders of record as of Feb 1, 2024. This increase is in sync with the company’s previously announced annual dividend growth rate target of 7-9% per share.This increase resulted in an annualized dividend of $1.63 per share compared with the previous level of $1.51. NRG Energy’s current dividend yield is 2.88%, higher than the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's average of 1.36%."", 'In the past few years, NRG Energy has made significant progress in its transformation to an integrated power company. It sells electricity to a wide variety of customers and none of them contributed more than 10% to the company’s revenues. Courtesy of its high-quality services, the company has been able to retain customers and does not depend on a single customer to generate revenues. This adds stability and predictability to customer bills and NRG’s earnings.Recently, the company completed the sale of its 44% equity interest in South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (“STP”) to Constellation Energy Corporation for $1.75 billion. STP is a 2,645-megawatt nuclear facility located about 90 miles southwest of Houston in Bay City, TX. The net proceeds from the transaction will further enable NRG to reduce debts and increase shareholders’ value.The company is focused on clean generation to lower emissions. NRG Energy entered into renewable power purchase agreements, totaling nearly 2.4 gigawatts, with third-party project developers and other counterparties. It continues to optimize its generation portfolio by retiring uneconomic fossil fuel plants, monetizing non-core assets and partnering for brownfield development.NRG Energy has the potential to expand and improve even more, which suggests that management will have sufficient funds to continue its shareholder-friendly activities in the future.', 'Companies involved in utility services generally have stable operations and earnings.

The key reason is that companies that regularly boost the size of their dividend checks tend to be high-quality businesses capable of delivering strong financial results in nearly any kind of economic environment.', 'In short, the dividend growth investing strategy is a proven way to build wealth over time. Armed with this insight, here are five blue chip dividend growth stocks that are near locks to make you richer over time.', '1. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the leading big box retailer in the U.S., with annual sales expected to surpass $666 billion in 2025 and a network of 4,622 stores across the country as of now.\xa0Walmart also has a strong presence in the global market and a high demand for its Walmart+ subscription service, making it a key competitor in the online retail space.', ""The company has been paying and increasing its dividend every year since 1974. In the last 10 years, Walmart has raised its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 1.94%. The retail giant's current yield is 1.4%, which is decent for a large-cap company still in growth mode. Its dividend is also sustainable, evidenced by its low payout ratio of 37.7%."", ""Walmart may not offer impressive dividend growth or yield, but it does have a commendable track record of regular increases to its payout. The company's solid competitive advantage also provides shareholders with an all-important margin of safety."", '2. Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) has been pushing the boundaries of biotech innovation since 1980. The company was among the first to successfully develop and market biologically based medicines, an industry that has grown into a $511 billion-plus market and continues to expand by double digits every year.', ""Amgen has boosted the size of its dividend checks every year since 2011, and its 10-year dividend growth rate stands at a blistering 13.9%. The biotech currently offers an above-average yield of 2.92%. Amgen's generous dividend also screens as safe, given its modest payout ratio of 59.2%, robust top-line growth prospects (estimated 15.8% growth in 2024), and management's commitment to rewarding loyal shareholders."", '3. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is a leading producer and distributor of beverages and snacks worldwide. The company owns many well-known brands, such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Doritos, Cheetos, and more. PepsiCo has a strong track record of dividend growth, with 51 years of consecutive increases and a 10-year dividend growth rate of 8.2%. The company offers a solid 2.98% annualized yield, but its payout ratio of 80.5% is somewhat elevated. However, PepsiCo is delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth currently, which should sustain its top-notch dividend policy.', ""4. Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is the world's largest pure-play medical device company. It sports leading positions in several high-growth markets, such as cardiac care, diabetes management, neurostimulation, and minimally invasive surgery. Medtronic has also demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders with a remarkable 46-year streak of dividend increases."", ""Over the last 10 years, the company has raised its dividend by an average of 9% annually. Moreover, Medtronic offers a solid 3.19% yield at current prices. The dividend is well supported by the company's mid-single-digit revenue growth outlook for fiscal year 2025 and management's dedication to the program despite its hefty 88.9% payout ratio."", ""5. Altria (NYSE: MO) is a leading tobacco company in the U.S. that enjoys a dominant market position. On the dividend side of the ledger, the tobacco giant offers a generous yield of almost 10%. The company has also increased its dividend 58 times in the last 54 years, demonstrating management's dedication to rewarding shareholders. However, Altria also has a high payout ratio of 77.5% at current levels."", 'Altria has grown its dividend payments by 6.5%, on average, per year over the previous decade. And even though the cigarette smoking rate in the U.S. is declining, Altria is expected to achieve low-single-digit revenue growth for the rest of the decade thanks to its strong pricing power and limited competition in the premium cigarette brand segment.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walmart wasn't one of them.

Lilly is the seller of one of the world's most sought-after drugs and has a solid portfolio of other top-selling products. And Medtronic is a medical device giant that, thanks to a recent transformation plan, is set for a new phase of growth."", 'Eli Lilly has taken center stage because it sells two drugs that doctors have been prescribing for weight loss, an area with demand so high that supply from Lilly and rival Novo Nordisk has fallen short of demand. Both companies are investing to increase production just to keep up with this booming market.', ""Lilly's Mounjaro is approved for type 2 diabetes, but doctors have prescribed it for weight loss, too. Late last year, regulators approved the same molecule -- tirzepatide -- for chronic weight management under the name Zepbound. Mounjaro brought in more than $2.9 billion in sales in the first nine months of last year, and there's reason to be optimistic about this drug and Zepbound moving forward. Goldman Sachs predicts the worldwide anti-obesity market could reach $100 billion by 2030, and that means there is plenty of potential for Lilly and Novo Nordisk both to win in this market."", 'On top of this, Lilly has other new products that have been driving earnings higher, with total revenue climbing 17% in the first nine months of 2023. And the company has steadily increased investments in research and development, with spend almost doubling from 2018. All of this has helped Lilly become speedier, decreasing the time from first human test to product launch by more than three years.', ""All of this should help Lilly continue to significantly grow revenue over time. And that's why, even though Lilly shares may look expensive at 50 times earnings estimates right now, they're well worth the price."", 'Medtronic is a medical device giant selling products across the areas of cardiovascular, diabetes, neuroscience, and medical surgical. Throughout its markets, its products hold No. 1 to No. 3 positions and have helped the company grow revenue over time.', ""But Medtronic's net income has had its ups and downs, so the medical device giant launched a transformation plan to boost efficiency, streamline operations, and set itself up for long-term growth. The efforts have been bearing fruit, with Medtronic reporting strength across businesses and geographies in the most recent quarter. The company even increased its full year revenue growth and earnings per share estimates."", 'Medtronic also aims to drive growth down the road by being one of the pioneers in artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. The company has established an ""AI center of excellence"" and already is using AI across its products, from the GI Genius endoscopy tool to its Minimed 780G diabetes management system.', ""Finally, you'll also benefit from passive income growth when you invest in Medtronic. The company aims to return at least 50% of free cash flow to investors each year and is putting the focus on dividends. Medtronic has increased its dividend payment for 46 years, which shows its commitment to rewarding investors, and it's likely to continue along this path."", ""Today, Medtronic shares trade for 16 times earnings estimates, which looks like a steal considering the company's leadership in its markets, the promise of its transformation plan, and passive income growth potential. So now looks like a great time to pick up shares of this monster stock -- and hold onto them for the long haul."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

With this addition, we have ten Medtronic locations with on-site solar arrays."", ""Our longstanding commitment to renewable energy predates even our ambition to be net zero by 2045. We've invested in a variety of low-carbon energy sources such as purchasing green electricity from the grid or generating our own renewable electricity on site. Last year, we used approximately 414,300 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable electricity - more than 46% of our total electricity usage. This accomplishment was in large part due to our solar arrays at our facilities around the globe."", ""Here are three things to know about how we're using the sun to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions:"", '1.

Our fleet of solar energy farms spans the globe.', 'Just as our company is embedded in all parts of the world, so is our commitment to producing green energy.', ""Our solar generation fields are often installed on roofs, which are otherwise unused spaces, said Daniel. Sometimes, we build carports and install solar panels on top, which offer an extra benefit for employees who drive to work. Some solar array systems generate 5% of a site's electricity needs, while others are nearly 50%."", 'Our notable solar sites around the globe include:', 'Juncos, Puerto Rico: Spanning 13 acres and outputting five megawatts at a given time, this site was first installed in 2017.

It's a one-megawatt system, meaning it can produce up to 2 million kilowatt-hours annually. For reference, the average U.S. home consumes 10,500 kilowatt-hours per year so the energy produced in Lafayette is equivalent to powering 200 homes for an entire year."", '3. Our ambitious energy goals are driving this work.', ""We are expanding our renewable footprint as we anticipate what's ahead, said Sterner.

In contrast, users of closed-loop systems set a target level of spinal cord activation and the device adjusts its output after every pulse based on signals from the body.', 'When Medtronic received a CE mark for its Inceptiv closed-loop device in August, it said the technology senses the neural response to stimulation 50 times per second. If the response increases, for example when the patient coughs, the device decreases stimulation. The goal is to avoid uncomfortable levels of overstimulation that can lead patients to reduce the output of their devices.\xa0', 'Medtronic is running a clinical trial in Australia to evaluate its closed-loop device.

Results reflected lower-than-anticipated revenues. Higher interest expenses and lower contributions from adjusted EBITDA were undermining factors.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on two occasions for as many missed, the average beat being 0.50%. This is depicted in the graph below:"", 'Crown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. Quote', 'Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.', ""The advancements in mobile technology, particularly 4G and 5G networks, coupled with the widespread use of bandwidth-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services in recent years, have propelled global mobile data usage. The surge in demand has led wireless carriers to increase capital spending, driven by efforts in deploying 4G and 5G networks, expanding wireless penetration and participating in spectrum auctions, consequently boosting the demand for CCI's wireless communication infrastructure.Also, its solid balance sheet position is likely to have supported its small cell deployment efforts required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment.However, the initial surge in tower activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has waned. As a result, management expected a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers. Moreover, the T-Mobile Sprint network rationalization is likely to weigh in 2023.Amid these, our estimate for quarterly site rental revenues stands at $1.57 billion, implying 0.7% decline year over year. We estimate revenues from the network services and other segment to decline significantly year over year to $80.5 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.65 billion, indicating a decrease of 6.56% from the year-ago reported number.Also, high interest expenses are likely to have been a spoilsport for CCI during the to-be-reported quarter. We expect fourth-quarter 2023 interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs to rise 12.5% year over year.Crown Castle’s activities in the quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.79 over the past month. The figure also suggests a 3.24% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For full year 2023, Crown Castle expected its guidance for adjusted FFO per share in the range of $7.50-$7.58.

This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”', 'Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.', 'The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.', 'United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That’s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.', 'Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing’s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.', '“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”', 'United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing’s efforts to bring that plane to market.', 'And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn’t anticipate it’ll be receiving the jets, either.', '“We are taking it out of our internal plans,” said Kirby. “And we’ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let’s leave it at that.”', 'United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.', 'But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.', 'That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.', '“We’re still going to be the fastest growing airline,” Kirby said. “But we’re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.”', 'Boeing would not comment directly on United’s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.', '“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”', 'Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.', 'United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.', '“I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,” he said. “I think we’re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.”', 'United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.', 'And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts.', 'The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

You'll pay over 6 times annual sales for the business today, compared to Nike's price-to-sales ratio of 3. That valuation gap is just as large on earnings. Nike looks like a relative steal at 30 times profits compared to Lululemon's ratio of 60."", 'Still, the athleisure apparel specialist is growing sales much more quickly than Nike is, and it can convert more of that revenue pool directly into earnings.

Recent figures from the Labor and Commerce departments in the US government indicate that jobs are being added to the economy at a brisk pace and strong retail sales, especially in motorsports and online purchases, have forced experts to revise growth estimates upwards. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said earlier this week the economy was doing well and this had given the central bank some flexibility to move carefully on monetary policy.\xa0', 'In the first employment report of the new year, the Labor Department revealed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 216,000 jobs in December, beating forecasts by around 36,000 jobs. Per the latest data, the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2023, down from 4.8 million in 2022. The decline should be seen in context of the 525 basis points worth of rate hikes by the Fed since the second quarter of 2022. Leisure, business, government, and manufacturing all registered increases in jobs. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in December, matching the gain in November. This raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.1% from 4.0% in November.', 'The Consumer Inflation report released by the Commerce Department also boosted investor confidence in the market. Retail sales climbed 0.6% in December after a 0.3% gain in November, beating forecasts that retail sales would only gain 0.4%. Sales increased 5.6% on a year-on-year basis in the month of December. The latest growth figures have forced experts to revise expectations of a rate cut in March to 55% from 65%.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shannon Drage, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Drage. You may begin.', 'Shannon R. Drage', ""Thank you, Camilla, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2023 4th quarter earnings. My name is Shannon Drage, the Director of Investor Relations. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or Slide 2 of the presentation, dealing with forward-looking information and the presentation of non-GAAP measures, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the earnings release as well as the presentation are available at zionsbancorporation.com. For our agenda today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Harris Simmons, will provide opening remarks. Following Harris's comments, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results. Also with us today are Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Chris Kyriakakis, Chief Risk Officer; and Derek Steward, Chief Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will hold a question-and-answer session. This call is scheduled for one hour. I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Thanks very much, Shannon, and we welcome all of you to our call this afternoon. As Shannon mentioned, Chris Kyriakakis is joining our call today as our new Chief Risk Officer, and we want to welcome him. Chris was formerly our Chief Audit Executive, and he's replacing Keith Maio, who recently retired after 32 years of really phenomenal service with Zions in a variety of senior positions. I'd like to start with comments on Slide 3, which includes some themes which are particularly applicable to Zions. Our financial performance this quarter reflects the unusual circumstances of the past year as events last spring were the catalyst for an acceleration of deposit betas across the industry. We've been proactive in managing our balance sheet, making adjustments to our hedging strategy, working with clients to bring back on balance sheet deposits that we'd steered to off-balance sheet money market funds in times of surplus liquidity. And we've demonstrated our ability to effectively manage interest rate and liquidity risk in a very dynamic environment. In the fourth quarter, we've seen the deposit mix stabilize and deposit costs start to level out. Net interest margin and net interest income were stable in the quarter, and we continue to have a higher concentration of more costly funding sources that is typical for us. And we believe in the near term that reducing our reliance on funding priced at or near wholesale rates, combined with continued deposit pricing discipline, regardless of the future rate path presents a meaningful opportunity to improve revenue performance. In the medium to long term, we remain focused on improving shareholder returns by growing profitable small business and commercial customer relationships by emphasizing growth in our capital markets and wealth management businesses and continuing to move away from single product loan only and other less profitable relationships.In 2023, we exited 2 national lending businesses that produced few deposits, and were experiencing declining levels of profitability, and we changed our approach to mortgage lending as part of our focus on improved profitability. We continue to invest in the business and in enabling technologies to deliver the products and services that our customers need and which enhance the customer experience, all while managing expense growth to nominal levels. We have an established track record for managing risk and underwriting credit with better-than-peer performance. We believe that the combination of these efforts will result in improved financial outcomes for our investors in years ahead.Turning to Slide 4. We've included key financial performance highlights for the quarter and for the full year. We reported a period-end loan balance increase of 3.8% for the full year, and 1.6% in the current quarter. Customer deposit balances were flat for the full year and were up 2.4% in the quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 77%. Net charge-offs as a percent of loans were just 6 basis points, both in the quarter and for the full year, down from an already low 8 basis points reported in the prior year. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.3% compared to 9.8% in the prior year. Moving to Slide 5. Linked quarter diluted earnings per share was down $0.35 to $0.78 per share on net earnings of $116 million due to the impact of the FDIC special assessment combined with lower noninterest income. Turning to Slide 6. Our fourth quarter adjusted pre-provision net revenue was $262 million, down from $272 million. The linked quarter decline was attributable primarily to lower noninterest revenue. Versus the year ago quarter, PPNR was down 38% as the increase in our cost of funds exceeded the increase in earning asset yields.So with that high-level overview, I'm going to ask Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional detail related to our financial performance. Paul?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Thank you, Harris. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining. I'll begin with a discussion of the components of pre-provision net revenue. Over 3/4 of our revenue is from the balance sheet through net interest income.Slide 7 includes our overview of net interest income and the net interest margin. The chart shows the recent 5-quarter trend for both. Net interest income on the bars and the net interest margin in the white boxes were consistent with the prior quarter as the repricing of earning assets kept pace with rising funding costs. Additional detail on changes in the net interest margin is outlined on Slide 8. On the left-hand side of this page, we've provided a linked quarter waterfall chart outlining the changes in key components of the net interest margin. The 14 basis point adverse impact associated with deposits, including changes in both rate and volume was offset by the positive impact of loan repricing and higher money market and securities yields. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds continue to serve as a significant contributor to balance sheet profitability. The right-hand chart on this slide shows the net interest margin comparison to the prior year quarter. Higher rates were reflected in earning asset yields, which contributed an additional 106 basis points to the net interest margin. This was more than offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs, which when combined with the increased value of noninterest-bearing funding, adversely impacted the net interest margin by 168 basis points. Overall, the net interest margin declined by 62 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Moving to noninterest income and revenue on Slide 9. Customer-related noninterest income was $150 million, a decrease of 4% versus the prior quarter due to lower loan servicing fees, primarily attributable to the sale of certain mortgage servicing rights recognized in the third quarter. The remainder of customer-related fees were relatively in line with the prior year as year-over-year decrease in capital markets revenue was offset by improved commercial account fees. Within capital markets, customer interest rate swap related revenue in 2023 was adversely impacted by loan demand and the interest rate environment. This headwind was largely offset as investment in new product capabilities has resulted in growth in other sources of capital markets revenue. We remain confident that we are poised for meaningful growth in capital markets activity and revenue. Our outlook for customer-related noninterest income for the full year of 2024 is moderately increasing relative to the full year 2023. The chart on the right side of this page includes adjusted revenue, which is the revenue included in adjusted pre-provision net revenue and is used in our efficiency ratio calculation. Adjusted revenue decreased 16% from a year ago and decreased by 2% versus the third quarter due to the factors noted previously.Adjusted noninterest expense, shown in the lighter blue bars on Slide 10, was essentially flat to the prior quarter at $489 million. Reported expenses at $581 million increased $85 million due to the $90 million in FDIC special assessment costs recognized in the quarter. Our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense is slightly increasing in 2024 relative to 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include our ability to manage technology and employment costs. Slide 11 highlights trends in our average loans and deposits over the past year. On the left side, you can see that average loans increased slightly in the current quarter. As loan demand remained soft, our expectation is that loans will be stable at year-end '24 when compared to year-end '23. Now turning to deposits on the right side of this page. Average deposit balances in the fourth quarter increased slightly as growth in customer deposits were offset by declines in broker deposits. The cost of deposits shown in the white boxes increased during the quarter to 206 basis points from 192 basis points in the prior quarter. As measured against the fourth quarter of 2021, the repricing beta on total deposits, including broker deposits, and based on average deposit rates in the fourth quarter was 39% and the repricing beta for interest-bearing deposits was 60%. Slide 12 includes a more comprehensive view of funding sources and total funding trends. The left side of the chart includes ending balance trends. Short-term borrowings have decreased $8 billion since the first quarter of 2023, as customer deposits have grown and earning assets have declined. On the right side, average balances for our key funding categories are shown along with the total cost of funding. As seen on this chart, the rate of increase in total funding cost at 15 basis points in the current quarter has continued to decline compared to the prior 3 quarters.Slide 13 shows noninterest-bearing demand deposit volume trend, you can see that the recent trend in demand deposit attrition appears to be flattening. Although demand deposit volumes have been declining over the past 6 quarters as customers move into interest-bearing alternatives, the contribution to the net interest margin shown in the white boxes, and, therefore, the value of the demand deposit portfolio has increased.Moving to Slide 14. Our investment portfolio exists primarily to be a ready storehouse of funds to absorb customer-driven balance sheet changes. On this slide, we show our securities and money market investment portfolios over the last 5 quarters. The investment portfolio continues to behave as expected. Maturities, principal amortization and prepayment-related cash flows were over $700 million in the third quarter. With this somewhat predictable cash flow, we anticipate that money market and investment securities balances combined will continue to decline over the near term, which will be a source of funds for the balance sheet. The duration of the investment portfolio, which is a measure of price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is slightly shorter compared to the prior year period, estimated at 3.6% currently versus 4.2% 1 year ago. This duration helps to manage the inherent interest rate risk mismatch between loans and deposits. With a larger deposit portfolio assumed to have a longer duration than our loan portfolio, fixed rate term investments are required to balance asset and liability duration. Moving to Slide 15. We've provided the projected trend of AOCI, accumulated other comprehensive income, based on an expected accretion and interest rate impacts based on the forward curve as of December 31. AOCI improved to $2.7 billion, from $3.1 billion in the prior year, largely due to principal amortization in the securities portfolio, combined with interest rate swap maturities. We expect based on the current forward curve that AOCI will decline by about $900 million cumulatively over the next 8 quarters. Slide 16 provides information about our interest rate sensitivity, which differs in content and format compared to prior quarters. While we provided standard parallel interest rate shock sensitivity measures in the appendix of this presentation, we believe a more dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity is most relevant in the current environment. Noted in the bar chart on the far-right side of this page, modeled net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2024 is 2.4% higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 using the implied forward path of interest rates at year-end and assuming a static balance sheet. 100 basis point parallel up and down shocks of this implied forward outcome suggests about 2% of interest rate sensitivity around that figure. This modeled analysis reveals that our balance sheet, while asset-sensitive using traditional measures, is positioned for net interest income growth if short-term rates fall faster than long-term rates.Utilizing this model outcome and overlaying management expectations for balance sheet changes and deposit pricing, we believe that net interest income will -- in the fourth quarter of 2024, will be stable to slightly increasing when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our outlook is that full year net interest income will be slightly decreasing in 2024 when compared to 2023. Risks and opportunities associated with this outlook include realized loan growth, competition for deposits and the path of interest rates across the yield curve. Moving to Slide 17. Credit quality remains strong. Classified loans increased $56 million, driven by the commercial real estate portfolio, while nonperforming assets decreased $4 million. Net charge-offs were 6 basis points of loans in the quarter. Loan losses in the quarter were somewhat granular and largely associated with our commercial loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is 1.26% of loans, a 4 basis point decrease over the prior quarter due to a modest improvement in our economic outlook. As we know, it is a topic of interest, we have included information regarding the commercial real estate portfolio with additional detail included in the appendix of this presentation. Slide 18 is a reminder of the discipline we have maintained over the past decade as it relates to the commercial real estate portfolio growth. We have chosen our partners carefully and our growth has remained well below peers over time. Slide 19 provides an overview of the commercial real estate portfolio. CRE represents 23% of our loan portfolio, with office representing 15% of total CRE or 3% of total loan balances. Credit quality measures for the total CRE portfolio remained relatively strong, though criticized and classified levels increased in the quarter. Overall, we continue to expect the CRE portfolio to perform well with limited losses based on the current economic outlook. Our loss absorbing capital position is shown on Slide 20. The CET1 ratio continued to grow in the third quarter to 10.3%. This, when combined with the allowance for credit losses, compares well to our risk profile as reflected in the low level of ongoing net charge-offs. We expect to maintain solid regulatory capital while managing to a below-average risk profile.Slide 21 summarizes the financial outlook provided over the course of this presentation. As a reminder, this outlook represents our best current estimate for the financial performance for the full year of 2024 as compared to 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. As we move to the question-and-answer section of the call, we request that you limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions. Camilla, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.', 'John G. Pancari', ""Just on the balance sheet commentary that you gave on the loan growth guidance of stable balances on an end-of-period basis, can you maybe talk about the -- what the trajectory could look like in terms of where do you expect you could see some growth and what's offsetting that that keeps you pretty conservative there in terms of flattish balances for the year?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, I'll start with that. The -- it's -- our outlook is a reflection of what we're hearing kind of on the ground from our frontline relationship managers. It feels like demand is softening. And so that ultimately, that's kind of what's baked into our outlook.When you get into the components of the portfolio, those are driven, as you know, by market conditions. So for example, as the commercial real estate market, the capital markets associated part of commercial real estate, as that becomes less of a takeout for commercial real estate loans, you may see those accumulate on our balance sheet as construction loans work to completion, while C&I, traditional C&I, for example, may decline with economic weakness. Harris or Scott, would you add anything to that?"", 'Scott J. McLean', ""This is Scott. I don't think I would. I think our feeling is that the economy is going to be moderately muted throughout the year, which would actually be a positive thing compared to what we all thought 6 to 9 months ago. So you would think that as we get towards the end of the year, we'll start to see loan growth in the economy probably pick up. But we had pretty good C&I growth last year despite some of the other movements, and we may be surprised on the upside there."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""I'd just add, the 1- to 4-family, the residential portfolio, we've seen growth. Some of that is a product we could call a onetime close product, which you had construction loans that were funding up and being completed. And that will -- I expect will subside somewhat. We've really tightened the parameters around that to make sure that it's not growing too fast relative to the portfolio overall and limiting the number of kind of single product kind of relationships that we have in that program. So I think that will probably slow a little bit. On the other hand, the economy feels like it -- you talk to any of our lenders today, and I don't think any of us are very good at predicting what the world is going to look like 3 months from now. But it does feel like the economy is going to probably be in a reasonably decent shape through the year, and that could help. So anyway, we'll watch with interest, John."", 'John G. Pancari', 'Okay. Great. And then just separately on the other side of the balance sheet, just maybe if you can give us your thoughts on what deposit growth could look like for the year as you look at the trends there? And then maybe also just a bit on -- around where do you see your noninterest-bearing mix stabilizing, it dropped down a bit to about 36% of deposits as of this quarter. So curious where you see that bottoming here?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, the good news is we did see deposit growth and meaningful deposit growth here as we moved into the end of the year. And I would note that both on-balance sheet deposits and kind of customer suite balances that is effectively customer money that we're sweeping off-balance sheet for them both increased in the quarter. So those are good things. As we look ahead and certainly what we've seen over the course of the last couple of quarters is that deposit rate is increasingly important, particularly for rate-sensitive money. And so as we move through the year, we're going to be carefully balancing the need for funds and the rate we pay on those funds, with the need to kind of continue to demonstrate improvement in our net interest margin. As it relates to -- and the cost of funds, obviously, associated with that. As it relates to where noninterest-bearing demand is trending, I think we saw some green shoots in terms of runoff in the current quarter as noninterest-bearing demand attrition appeared to slow from what we've seen historically. So it's very difficult to predict sort of precisely where that goes, but I would note that my expectation is we will continue to see some noninterest-bearing deposit attrition just because of the differential in interest rates between 0 and the prevailing market rate. So that trend has slowed. It feels like it will continue to slow, but I'm not predicting an end certainly in the near term."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point.', 'David Patrick Rochester', ""On the NII guide, just given your comments about flat loans this year and then run off in cash and securities, it sounds like you're baking in lower earning assets, I guess, on average for the year. I guess, what are you, at this point, assuming for deposit betas in that analysis as well, just some of the cuts that you're baking in for the year?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""So in that particular outlook, we are following the forward curve at the end of the year. And the forward curve does include several rate cuts, particularly as you get in the second half of the year. The assumption around deposit beta there, if you think about our deposit portfolio, what you see is this kind of bimodal, in that you've got a lot of very low interest rate deposits and then you've got some sort of higher beta, higher rate deposits. Our key assumption there, and I feel pretty good about it, is that those higher beta, higher rate deposits, we will be able to -- would be able to reprice those relatively quickly if interest rates on the short end were to begin to fall. But the point of the interest sensitivity analysis that we present is to show that we're pretty balanced. And if rates were to remain flat or down a little or maybe even up a little, which doesn't look as likely here on the near term, we believe that we're going to be able to carve a good path for net interest income, a predictable path and that it should be relatively stable based on all these other things."", 'David Patrick Rochester', 'Okay. And then just as a follow-up, how much in the way of the off-balance sheet sweep deposits are there at this point? And is that still an opportunity for you guys to pay down some of the higher-cost stuff on balance sheet? Or is that largely played out at this point?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, as I said, the good news is that those off-balance sheet, I'll call them, deposits, grew this quarter. I think they're near $7 billion?"", 'Scott J. McLean', '$7.3 billion.', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Thank you, Scott. $7.3 billion. Those are extremely rate-sensitive. And so with the right rate, it's possible that we could continue to pull some of those on the balance sheet. But I think we've managed our deposit portfolio pretty well here over the last couple of quarters. And I feel good about where we're at as it relates to the mix of rate and volume. And so I wouldn't necessarily be expecting to pull those -- continue to pull those on the balance sheet, based on our current outlook for funding need."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.', 'Manan Gosalia', ""On the deposit portfolio, you just spoke about how it's very bimodal and the assumption is that the higher beta deposits can reprice relatively quickly. So as we think through rate cuts and if we can get 6 or 7 rate cuts over the next 18 months or so, would there be a difference in how those rate cuts play through in terms of the benefits? So for instance, will the first few rate cuts be more or less positive than the next few rate cuts?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""That's pretty difficult to predict. I think over time, my point of view is, over time, the lower rates are the more -- the faster rates kind of hit an implied floor and where that implied floor is -- has been reset lower over the last 10 years. But certainly, for the first several rate cuts, I would expect, particularly, as I said, for the sort of very high beta, high rate deposits, I would expect that we would be able to follow those down pretty quickly in repricing."", 'Manan Gosalia', 'Great. And maybe on the reserves in the ACL ratio. I think you mentioned that it decreased due to a less negative economic outlook. So if you can expand on that and talk about what is embedded into your ACL outlook? And if you think that ACL can come down further from here if a soft landing becomes more and more likely?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, yes, I'll start with that. We use, as many do, we use an outside resource for the macroeconomic forecast. And the 2 key driving components of the allowance for credit losses are the underlying credit quality in the portfolio and migration, whether or not the portfolio is migrating in a way that's consistent with prior estimates. And then the macroeconomic outlook is, of course, the other piece of that.So generally speaking, I would say credit migration is proceeding similar to our expectation. And so the change in the allowance, and it's a pretty minor change in the allowance, is really based on a slightly better macroeconomic forecast."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.', 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Wondering on the earning asset side, you mentioned that you do expect earning asset yields to increase throughout the year. Just wondering, last quarter, you had talked about like 5 to 10 a quarter. And I'm just wondering, just given the rate moves and what's coming on the books today versus what's coming off, how much flow-through do you still expect to see as we go forward?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. Ken, that's remained pretty consistent this quarter. It's hard to have a lot of insight into what happens more than a couple of quarters out. But our expectation is, with -- it's a combination of kind of fixed rate pay downs that's in the form of loans and investment securities. And then the kind of amortization of swaps or maturities of swaps, including canceled swaps. Those are kind of underwater based on the original received pay rate.The combination of all of those things should provide a little bit of lift to earning asset yields for the next couple of quarters. And so it's consistent with that 0 to 5 that we expressed last time."", 'Kenneth Michael Usdin', ""Okay. Got it. And on the right side of the balance sheet, how much more room do you have? You mentioned that you're seeing good deposit growth and you're not expecting much loan growth. Securities portfolio is kind of flattish, not shrinking. So how much more can you reduce that reliance on brokered and other wholesale funding from where you were at the end of this year?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, yes, it's a combination of, as you correctly point out, the securities portfolio is going to continue to amortize away somewhat predictably as we've noted for the last several quarters. Loan growth will be the big question mark there in terms of funds needed. But clearly, we're focused on bringing in customer deposits at a rate that's lower than kind of alternative wholesale funds. And so to the extent we continue to see that opportunity, we'll continue to work that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson.', 'Peter J. Winter', ""I wanted to just follow up on John's question earlier on loan growth because it is coming in, your outlook is a little bit more cautious than what we've heard from other banks. We've heard that borrower sentiment has improved a little bit versus 90 days ago. And there was an expectation once the Fed starts to cut rates, you should start to see loan demand pick up -- line utilization pick up. But you guys -- you're not thinking that way?"", 'Scott J. McLean', ""This is Scott. I would just say that we've seen line utilization increase a bit. So that is happening. But trying to compare others' outlooks to ours, it's just kind of a function of who they're talking to. If you roll back a couple of years when loans were pretty flat in the industry and flat for us, everybody was talking about loans were going to definitely start increasing by a certain quarter, and we hesitated saying that. And I'm glad we did because they were wrong, and we happened to be right on that particular turn that happened a couple of quarters later.So I just would go back to what Harris said, it's very hard to project. I also think that interest rates, if you look at them historically, they're not especially bad right now. I mean, if you go back 20, 30, 40 years, they're generally in line. So they're not at an especially historically based high level. So I don't know that we have to have interest rates going down, the short-term rates, to see activity pick up, could certainly help some industries. But I don't think most business folks, commercial business folks are overly anxious about the current level of rates."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Can I just add, again, I noted earlier, if we see the economy start to pick up, I would expect that that will help with loan growth. But we do have probably slowing growth in the residential portfolio, which is going to offset some of that. That's probably the reason that we might be a little cautious."", 'Peter J. Winter', ""Okay. And then just one last question. your economic outlook, you mentioned, that improved slightly. You've got strong capital. I'm just wondering what are some of the parameters you need to see in order to feel comfortable to kind of resume share buybacks?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, I'll tell you as it relates to bank capital, there's a lot of uncertainty around the regulatory rules right now. So we're paying a lot of attention to that. We're not a Category IV bank, but we certainly would be, I expect, by the time the proposed capital rules become effective.So it would be nice to see a little more certainty around what those capital rules are. And even though generally speaking, we're -- our credit performance has been excellent. We are feeling a little bit better about the macroeconomic path. We still remain a little cautious. And so over the near term, at least, I wouldn't expect a large share repurchase."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Can I -- I'd just add. I mean, it's been actually a long time since we've really had a seriously challenging credit cycle. And so even though we're all kind of thinking probably it's going to be a soft landing, et cetera. There's enough uncertainty in the world. I think it's probably a time to be a little conservative on the capital front. And especially given what Paul said about the -- just rules are in flux, et cetera. So we'll be a little careful."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW.', 'Christopher Edward McGratty', ""Great. Paul, maybe a high-level question on the margin. You had a peer last week talk about kind of a 3%-plus NIM, similar company, balance sheet size and mix. Feels like that's kind of the trajectory you guys are messaging given the balance sheet dynamics. I'm just kind of interested if you would agree with kind of what the overall level of when margins may be going."", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, in my experience, the net interest margin is extraordinarily difficult to predict because there are so many factors. In our case, I think what we're demonstrating is a pretty stable net interest income and declining earning assets. And so you do the math on that, and the expectation is some modest improvement in the margin."", 'Christopher Edward McGratty', ""Okay. Perfect. And then I just want to make sure I understand all the slides, the sensitivities that you provide, which are helpful. If I kind of zoom out, I mean, the ideal rate environment for Zions going into '24, I mean, we've talked about higher for longer and also the Fed curve like the forward curve. What would be kind of the dial-up if you could have it your way?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, again, our modeling is showing a pretty balanced position. So I certainly like to think that we'll be a little agnostic as it relates to the ultimate path and curve shape. We -- through portfolio layer swaps, we have worked to hedge our tangible common equity to a spike higher in rates on the longer end of the curve.And then as I said, on the shorter end of the curve, we feel with the distribution of deposits that we have that we would be able to adjust deposit pricing on those very high-priced deposits pretty quickly on the downside. And so, again, it's a pretty deliberate construction of a hedging program to manage the balance sheet in an uncertain interest rate environment. And so a long way of saying that I wouldn't necessarily pick a best path for us. If we've done what we think we're doing well, then we should be pretty agnostic to rate."", 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""Yes. I'd just -- I would only add, if we saw rates come down, 1.5 points or something like that, it will be a great thing for borrowers. And so I think it does matter in terms of our borrowers. And so I've always thought the kind of 3 on the short end and 5 on the long end is about nirvana for a company like ours."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brandon King with Truist Securities.', 'Brandon Thomas King', ""So I understand the use of your liquidity position to kind of sort of run it down to pay for loan growth and other uses of funds. But is there a certain floor that you're thinking when you think about your cash position in money market investments?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, yes. So on cash and money market, I think you'd see us probably at around $2 billion or so, given the size and composition of the balance sheet. It's pretty close to where we're running today. We don't -- it's cash in sort of in the traditional sense, therefore, it's immediate liquidity. But we feel very confident in our ability to draw on the liquidity embedded in our investment portfolio through the repo in other markets."", 'Brandon Thomas King', ""Okay. And then on your comments about the higher cost deposits, how many of those are indexed? And if not, if they're negotiated, could you just give us a sense of how you plan on going about lowering those deposit costs to do your rate cuts and kind of how you're approaching your customers with that?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes. The majority of those deposits are not specifically indexed. That is that they will not sort of automatically reset, but we've got an army of bankers who are talking to our customers every day. And as rates -- the value of money falls, if short-term rates fall, then I'm confident that we'll be able to manage those rates down pretty quickly."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler.', 'Matthew Timothy Clark', ""Just the first one around the customer-related fee income. I know it's only just under 10% of your overall fees kind of annually or at least in 2023. But just on the wealth management side, a little surprised to see that dip down. Can you just update us on the flows there, ins and outs and how those fees are recognized, the timing of those fees?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, I think it's -- when you say dipped down, I think it's kind of bouncing between 14% and 15%. I think that's probably kind of rounding that's driving that. I would say, particularly notable in our wealth management group, you'll notice that there has been some market volatility over the course of the last couple of years, and I think the strength of our program is demonstrated in the consistency of revenue that you see there."", 'Matthew Timothy Clark', 'Okay. But in terms of how those fees are -- the timing of those -- how those fees are recognized, is it on a delay -- is it kind of a one quarter lag? Or is it consistent with the performance in the quarter?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Yes, it's consistent. It's up to date and consistent with the performance of the quarter, there's not a lag there."", 'Matthew Timothy Clark', 'Okay. Okay. And then just one quick one. If you have the spot rate on deposits at the end of the year.', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""I don't have it handy. We'll have to call you back with that one."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Brody Preston with UBS.', 'Broderick Dyer Preston', ""Paul, I just wanted to follow up on the NII guide on Slide 16. So it says, 4Q '24 expected to be stable to slightly increasing when compared to 4Q '23. So that would be considered 0% to 2%, correct?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, we use words, not numbers, but it's certainly low single digit."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', 'Got it. Okay. And I wanted to follow up on the deposit beta commentary. I understand that you have a mix of high beta and low beta deposits. So I was hoping to better understand what the interest-bearing deposit beta on the way down is underpinning that specific guidance? It kind of implies a 40% to 45% interest-bearing deposit beta on the way down. Is that about right?', 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Let me think about that. That might be in the ballpark. Again, looking -- thinking about the amount of relatively high beta products we have, we think we're going to have a very high beta on those. Our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits has been -- interest-bearing, has been 60% over this cycle. And so we're -- that's interest-bearing, that excludes the DDA. So I'm certainly hopeful that we would be able to have a beta that looks like that on the way down."", 'Broderick Dyer Preston', ""Okay. Great. And then my last one is just around the swaps. You terminated another $800 million of received fixed swaps this quarter. I just wanted to better understand what the -- what drives the decision to terminate the swaps? And then you've done that a few times, I think, over the last year or so. Could you clarify what the NII impact of the accretion of the swap losses will be in 2024?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', ""Well, we -- I don't have the chapter and verse details in front of me, but the reason that we have been canceling those swaps is that the swaps are there to help add asset duration. And the asset duration was to sort of balance the deposit duration. Depositor behavior has evolved differently than we expected. And so we've seen the DDA runoff, and we've seen higher betas perhaps than what we would have modeled a year ago. And so that effectively shortens the duration of deposits. The canceled swaps and then the paid fixed swaps that we've put on have all been for the purpose of shortening asset durations to try to create that balance between asset durations and liability durations.As we look ahead, the net interest income outlook that we've provided incorporates the effect of the amortization of those swap maturities that you just asked about."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jon Armstrong (sic) [Arfstrom] with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Jon Glenn Arfstrom', 'Credit looks pretty good for you guys, and I understand the prepared comments on the outlook. But can you comment on some of the criticized and classified trends in the back of the deck on like 33, 34 and 36, those slides? Curious what you expect on losses over time.', 'Derek Steward', ""Sure. Thanks, Jon. This is Derek. Loss -- future losses are harder to predict here. But what we're seeing is some continued challenges in the office portfolio. We continue to work through those, again, our office portfolio is a pretty small book, for less than 3% of the total loans. We continue to work through those. We did not have any new nonaccruals in the office portfolio this quarter. What we are seeing is the multifamily portfolio, seeing some increase in criticized there. And it really comes from 3 things. One is some delayed construction, which is being solved by additional equity from our sponsors. And then the second thing that's contributing is higher interest rates, as well as the third would be some slowdown in the lease-up velocity that we're seeing for the multifamily book. They're still able to achieve rents, but in some cases, they're granting concessions. It's just taking the lease up a little bit longer than originally underwritten. So in most cases, we think it will just take a little longer to get there, and the sponsors are continuing to support the portfolio as we work through those trends."", 'Jon Glenn Arfstrom', 'And I guess one of the surprises in the quarter was the 0 provision. And I guess, how do you guys want us to think about the provision going forward? Is it safe to go back to where you were in the prior 3 quarters? Or do you still...', 'Harris Henry Simmons', ""I would just offer -- just a perspective on it. We've got about at present, there's about 19 years of loss could be absorbed by the allowance, given the total loss performance over the last year. Clearly, we wouldn't have an allowance that runs out 19 years' worth of losses. We've got a portfolio duration much shorter than that. It really reflects the fact that as we built that, we expected what we're now in fact seeing, and that's what the accounting rules require, is that you basically forecast what is the loss in the life of the portfolio.And so the fact that we're seeing increased levels of criticized isn't a great concern. I'd also add to what Derek just said, for example, with respect to multifamily, you're probably -- deals that have done -- this isn't just Zions. I think this is really -- we've seen this across the industry. In recent years, the equity going into those deals is probably double what it was a decade ago. And so there is a lot more cushion and ability for these deals to experience some slowdown, et cetera. But we, nevertheless, will show those as criticized if they're not meeting the original projections.So we don't see a lot of -- I think Derek would be true to say that, is we're not seeing a lot of loss content in it. But the allowance that we were building in the first 3 quarters of the year kind of anticipates what -- anticipated what we've started to see. But even at the current levels, criticized levels, nonaccruals, nonperforming assets at 0.39% of total loans and real estate owned is in very good shape relative to historical experience. So I think we're pretty comfortable with it."", 'Jon Glenn Arfstrom', ""Paul, any thoughts on the provision? I'm just trying to help out Shannon, so we don't end up with a wide consensus. But somewhat teasing you, but any thoughts? I mean, is it a 0 provision going forward?"", 'Paul E. Burdiss', 'As I said, the key determinants are the economic outlook. And then the path, as Harris was saying, the sort of path of credit migration. I mean, in the current quarter, effectively, what happened is that credit migration path performed approximately as expected in the prior quarter, and the macroeconomic forecast is just a little bit better. And so those are the key determinants. And so to the extent those continue to hold true, then that would have a positive impact on the allowance for credit loss.', 'Harris Henry Simmons', 'I mean the question about future provisions reminds me of the story of 2 economists walking down the street, and one says, ""There\'s a $20 bill on the sidewalk,"" and the other says, ""So that\'s impossible, someone would have picked it up."" And the point being that under CECL, the accounting standard, if you think something is going to happen in the future, you\'ve got to reflect it now. And so almost by definition, you can\'t predict the future provisions are going to be one way or the other because you\'d already picked that up, if you will.So I think it\'s really hard to say what it becomes in the future. You just have to see how the future changes every quarter or your outlook for it. But I do think it\'s -- again, I think it\'s fair to say, I think we feel -- the bottom line is, I think we feel pretty comfortable with the quality of the portfolio, where our reserves are today, and we\'ll see where it goes from here.', 'Operator', 'We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session.

The company saw staggering growth and topped $1 trillion in total-payment volume in 2022, and the stock traded at a sky-high valuation.', ""However, the past few years have challenged the fintech. Discretionary spending dropped amid high inflation, and its staggering growth slowed. The company shifted its strategy, hired a new CEO, and is working to reinvent itself and hold on to its leadership position in the payment space. The 80% decline could be an excellent opportunity to scoop up shares of the fintech on the cheap. Here's why."", ""PayPal's growth during the pandemic cannot be understated. Over two years, the company added 122 million accounts, grew revenue by 43%, and surpassed $1 trillion in total-payment volume. During an investor presentation in 2021, former CEO Dan Schulman told investors the company expected to double its user base to 750 million accounts -- a bold forecast indeed."", 'At its peak, investors optimistically priced PayPal stock at over 109 times earnings and nearly 17 times sales. However, the growth proved to be unsustainable. Customers returned to more normal spending habits in the years following the pandemic, and heightened inflation weighed on discretionary spending. Also, eBay transitioned away from PayPal to Adyen as its preferred payment platform, putting even more pressure on growth.', 'Under Schulman, PayPal shifted gears and focused on getting more from existing customers. This meant it would focus on getting more transactions per active account, which would be a more cost-effective approach to growing revenue and net income. This shift in strategy had investors less than excited about the stock, which has declined over 80% from its peak price of $310 per share in 2021.', ""Last year, Schulman announced he would retire by the end of the year. After a months-long search, the PayPal board selected Alex Chriss as its next CEO and president. Chriss is a longtime industry veteran who previously worked as an executive vice president and general manager for Intuit's small-business and self-employed group. During his five years leading the small-business segment, revenues grew by 23% compounded annually."", 'While PayPal stock is down, the company is operating from a position of strength. According to data from Datanyze, PayPal has a 40% share of the global payment-processing market. Its products include branded and unbranded checkout options, allowing businesses to accept online or in-app payments.', ""Braintree, which is the unbranded option, is a rapidly growing part of PayPal's business. In the third quarter, total-payment volume through Braintree grew by 32% and has been a key driver of the broader company's total-payment volume growth."", ""However, one criticism is that the Braintree business has lower margins, and its growth pressures its total profit margin. One part of PayPal's strategy to improve its profit margin is to improve its small and medium-sized business offerings with PayPal Complete Payments."", 'In a recent interview with CNBC, Chriss said innovation has been slow for the fintech and that ""2024 will be a transition year for us."" Chriss said PayPal would do a better job of leveraging artificial intelligence on its trove of data to improve conversion rates for merchants and help them connect better with consumers.', ""If PayPal can successfully scale its PayPal Complete Payments, it could boost its profit margin and eventually provide additional offerings for small and mid-sized businesses, which was Chriss's specialty at Intuit."", ""Analysts haven't shown any love to PayPal stock. Five analysts have downgraded the company since December due to pressure on its margins and increased competition from Apple Pay, arguing that Paypal is moving too slowly on strategic initiatives."", 'The share price reflects this pessimism. Today, PayPal stock is priced at 9.9 times its forward earnings and 1.9 times forward sales, well below its historical average. The stock is near its cheapest valuation and is less than half of the S&P 500 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.', ""PayPal continues to post solid growth. In Q3, total-payment volume grew another 15% while revenue increased by 8%, and it generated over $1 billion in free cash flow. The company has work to do to improve its margins, and under new CEO Alex Chriss, I'm optimistic that it can make good on these initiatives."", ""Investors will learn more about PayPal's vision for the future when it hosts its innovation day on January 25. However, given how pessimistic investors have been on the stock, I think today is an excellent opportunity to scoop up shares of this fintech on the cheap and add to them over time, as long as it executes on its strategy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

Elizabeth Warren’s office that was sent to the banking industry where they said fraud claims had tripled between 2020 and 2022, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. The investigation centered around Zelle and indicated not only was fraud rampant, but was getting worse. And banks have often been unwilling to make customers whole, even if they were victims of fraud.', 'As a solution, Bragg asked for more safety measures, such as lowering the limit of daily transfers, requiring wait times on larger transfers, and for a confirmation when suspicious transfers occur. Even something as small as canceling a transaction would help, Bragg said', '“A failure to take proactive steps in the name of your consumers will lead to further illegal behavior and countless unsuspecting victims,” Bragg wrote in the letter.', 'Venmo and its parent company PayPal said they take safety and security seriously.', '“In addition to proactively leveraging sophisticated fraud detection tools, manual investigations, and partnering closely with law enforcement agencies to protect our customers against common scams, we have several options in place to enable enhanced layers of security and protection directly within our apps,” a PayPal spokesperson said in a statement.', 'In a statement, Zelle said it was “aware of isolated criminal incidents described in the Manhattan District Attorney’s letter.”', '“Providing a safe and reliable service to consumers is the top priority of Early Warning Services, LLC, the network operator of Zelle, and our 2,100 participating banks and credit unions,” the company said. “As a result of our continued efforts to build on Zelle’s strong foundation of security, less than one tenth of one percent of transactions are reported as fraud or scams, and that percentage keeps getting smaller.”', 'CashApp did not respond to requests for comment.', 'Consumers should be protected by fraudulent electronic fund transfers, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.', 'But they often are not covered, Warren’s office found in its investigation, despite regulations that are designed to cover unauthorized access to customers’ accounts. The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid.', 'Bragg says he’s seen so many instances of criminals using payment apps as a crime of opportunity.', 'This past year, one man was arrested several times after targeting drunk victims in the early morning hours, either asking to borrow their phone or outright snatching it, prosecutors said.', 'In one instance in 2022, the alleged thief grabbed his victim’s phone and slashed them on the ear, shoulder and forearm with what appeared to be a knife when the victim tried to get it back, according to court records in Manhattan. When he was asked by a detective why he kept robbing people like this, he replied “because it’s easy,” records show.', 'In another instance, a team of thieves worked together to steal roughly $6,500 from as many as 50 Lyft drivers in 2020, court records show. The passenger would ask to put in a new address into the Lyft driver’s phone and once inside, they would transfer the in-app earnings to their own bank accounts using Cash App, the records show.', 'Last January, two men were charged after one held a gun to the victim’s chest and the other held a knife to the same victim’s throat, demanding their unlocked mobile device, court records show. Once in custody, investigators found that the pair has sent themselves $1,749 using Cash App, the records show.', 'These offenses aren’t just happening in New York. Other major cities are seeing this trend increase as well.', 'In Los Angeles, a 23-year-old man pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a scheme where he met other men from a dating app and then used their phones to send himself money, federal prosecutors said.', 'In Boston, a man who thought he was meeting up for an online date was forced to unlock his phone at knifepoint when masked robbers ordered him to Vemno them $1,000, according to local prosecutors.', 'Bragg said his team has been trying to get the word out in recent years and have heard from victims who never came forward during outreach campaigns about cash app thefts.', '“It’s sobering and disconcerting,” Bragg said. “Preventing this is what we need to be focused on as well and that’s what this initiative is all about.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Here's why shares of Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) are due for their own rally in the new year."", ""If you're looking for a bargain among industry leaders that is profitable and has a wide customer reach, look no further than Alibaba. It's the leading e-commerce and cloud computing provider in China, but the stock is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 7.5, which is absurdly cheap."", 'Alibaba is entrenched in the daily lives of millions of customers and businesses, offering entertainment, retail stores, local services, and digital media, in addition to its core e-commerce marketplaces and cloud computing business. Alibaba generated $130 billion of revenue across all these businesses over the last year.', ""The stock is 79% off its peak from a few years ago. China's regulatory environment has been a factor, creating some uncertainty for investors, but the biggest problem impacting the stock's performance is a sluggish economy. Alibaba isn't growing nearly as fast as it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a recipe for a falling share price, especially when Alibaba stock was priced for lots of growth."", 'The good news is that Alibaba has a new CEO who is focused on making improvements, including ways to better monetize its non-core businesses to unlock more value for shareholders.', ""Alibaba stock has tremendous upside from these share prices. The company ended the last quarter with $67 billion in equity securities and other investments. It's also raking in $30 billion in free cash flow, while the market value for the whole company is just $171 billion. That's a genuine bargain for one of the top e-commerce and cloud computing providers in the world."", ""Analysts expect Alibaba to grow earnings to $10.74 by fiscal 2026 (Alibaba's fiscal year ends in March).

The stock has collapsed over the headwinds in the economy that caused lower growth in PayPal's branded checkout volumes, but the market might be overlooking some key advantages that will see the company (and the stock) bounce back."", 'Despite the recent headwinds, PayPal is no slouch of a competitor with 430 million active customers and merchant accounts. Its large merchant network and customer base casts a wide net to capture more spending in the $5 trillion e-commerce market.', ""PayPal processed $388 billion of payments in the third quarter alone. It's also showing there is a lot of growth still out there, considering its quarterly payment volume was up 15% over the same quarter in 2022. That's impressive for a company that has been around for more than 20 years."", ""PayPal is ultimately benefiting from consumers' reluctance to change. It's human nature to stick with something that is familiar, and this explains why PayPal continues to see customers are not only sticking with the platform but also increasingly using their accounts. After a slight dip in user activity in 2022, the number of transactions per account picked up last year, growing 9% year over year in 2023's third quarter."", ""Recent headwinds in retail spending won't stick around forever.

Investors are hoping that things can improve going forward."", ""Where will this top fintech stock be in three years? Let's take a closer look at PayPal's potential."", ""PayPal's long history in the industry means the company's payment services are ubiquitous these days. At the end of 2022, PayPal's branded checkout solution was the most widely accepted digital wallet, with 79% share at the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe. There's no reason to believe PayPal won't still have a huge lead three years from now."", ""But competition is intensifying. The second-most-accepted digital wallet is Apple Pay. Apple's service has an advantage in that it is integrated into iOS, one of the most popular mobile operating systems. Consequently, the tech giant can put its payment option front and center, which is something PayPal will continue to have to deal with."", 'However, PayPal processed a whopping $1.6 trillion of annualized total payment volume (TPV) in the third quarter of 2023, which shows it has tremendous reach. You can be sure that TPV will be meaningfully higher in three years, should past trends continue.', 'PayPal has a user base of 428 million active accounts. And although this figure has leveled off in recent quarters, engagement, as measured by transactions per user, continues rising at a double-digit clip. ', ""PayPal will continue to benefit from the ongoing secular growth of online shopping, which today only represents about 16% of all retail spending in the U.S. There's clearly still a long runway."", ""As the global economy becomes more digitized, it's not hard to believe that cashless transactions will continue to proliferate. As a leader in the space, PayPal is in an advantageous position."", ""Unlike many younger fintech companies, PayPal has consistently posted positive earnings. In fact, over the past five years, the business's quarterly operating margin has averaged 15.9%. Viewed in isolation, this is encouraging for investors to see. "", ""But it's worth pointing out that the operating margin hasn't shown signs of expanding. This is where the new CEO, Alex Chriss, could have a huge effect. During his first quarterly earnings call, he talked about how one of the main focuses is not only to drive growth, but to figure out ways to boost operational efficiencies. We've seen a similar playbook across corporate America, where businesses are trying to trim the fat that they added during the pandemic surge."", ""Should Chriss be successful with this plan, PayPal's earnings could soar over the next three years. This will mean greater free cash flow generation and a much larger amount of share repurchases."", ""Just because a company reports strong fundamentals, like PayPal has been and is likely to continue doing, it doesn't necessarily mean that shareholders will benefit from outsized returns. Of course, the stock's starting valuation is a critical factor. "", ""As of this writing, PayPal shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.5. Based on the positive attributes that I discussed above, this depressed valuation seems like an absolute bargain. It represents a huge discount to both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 Index. And it indicates that investors are still pessimistic about PayPal's prospects."", ""Consensus analyst estimates call for 49% earnings per share (EPS) growth between 2022 and 2025, which alone would translate to terrific returns for investors should the valuation stay constant. But if we assume that PayPal's forward P/E multiple gets back to its trailing-three-year average of 30, investors will surely see their gains skyrocket significantly higher."", ""All else equal, a low valuation reduces risk from an investor's perspective, while at the same time adding upside if the business performs well.

While rate cuts might be coming in the second half of 2024, many analysts believe we are in for an elevated interest rate environment for several years to come. Vanguard said in its 2024 outlook report that after years of zero interest rates we are expected to see the dawn of elevated interest rates, which the firm said would be the return of ""sound money."" Vanguard believes this development would bode well for the global financial markets. Vanguard said the persistence of positive real interest rates ""provides a solid foundation"" for long-term risk-adjusted returns. Vanguard said that this ""return of sound money"" would help individuals reach their financial goals and result in judicious spending and allocation of budgets.', 'Soft Landing Unlikely?', 'Vanguard also thinks the much-awaited ""soft landing"" is unlikely amid a decline in growth as US household savings that kept powering the resilience of the economy in 2023 are expected to run out.', '""A resilient consumer and fiscal policy are behind this outperformance. A strong labour market that has averaged more than 225,000 monthly job creations in 2023 has driven above-trend growth in real incomes. This has added to household balance sheets that were already stronger because of the fiscal support received during the Covid-19 pandemic. Legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act—all enacted between November 2021 and August 2022—have further supported growth through private and public investment. Despite significant progress on inflation and strong economic growth, we believe a “soft landing”—where inflation returns sustainably to the Federal Reserve’s target absent weakness in demand—is unlikely. The last mile on the path to 2% inflation will be the most difficult. In the year ahead, we expect a combination of below-trend growth, rising unemployment and slowing wage growth. This would occur as the labour market loosens, in large part because of higher-than- expected labour supply growth. We expect the Fed to start easing policy in the second half of 2024, and we expect the policy rate to be cut below 4% by the end of 2024,"" the Vanguard report added.', ""But how all of this would affect the stock market in the US? Many analysts are highly bullish on stocks for 2024 as they believe inflation will come down and the Fed will begin to cut rates. Fundstrat's Tom Lee in December 2023 said while talking to a program on CNBC that he sees a 50% chance of double-digit growth in US stocks in 2024."", 'Tom Lee said the 2% inflation target set by the Fed was becoming very ""visible."" Lee expects the S&P 500 to touch 5200 in 2024. When asked how he came up with this number, Lee said in his calculations earnings expectations hold a lot of weight in addition to PE multiples.

Investors often show a preference for stocks with high dividend yields, making these strategies convenient for guiding investment choices within the index. This approach simplifies the decision-making process for investors seeking stocks that offer substantial dividend returns. The Russell 2000 Index is a stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smallest publicly traded companies in the US. Since the start of 2024, the index is down by 1.94%, compared with a 2.29% gain of the S&P 500.', ""While the Russell 2000 has recently lagged the overall market, historical records indicate that this hasn't always been the case. A report from CME Group highlighted a specific instance when the Russell 2000 outperformed the S&P 500 by 80% during a period of intense economic upheaval in the stock market. This period, spanning from January to June 1980 and then from August 1981 to December 1982, witnessed double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, and consecutive recessions. Investors, during this time, perceived smaller companies as more adept at navigating challenging economic conditions compared to their larger counterparts. The report also mentioned that from 1999 to 2014, a period of financial turmoil encompassing events such as the tech market decline, the 9/11 attacks, the subprime bubble, economic downturns, and the implementation of quantitative easing, small-cap stocks once again demonstrated a rapid outperformance over large-cap stocks. Specifically, the Russell 2000 significantly surpassed the S&P 500, delivering a notable 114% outperformance."", 'Despite the impressive historical returns of small-cap stocks, they often carry an inherent level of volatility. The prevailing perception is that smaller companies may lack sufficient excess cash flow to meet shareholder obligations. Consequently, when investors seek dividend-paying stocks, the general tendency is to concentrate on larger companies, which are perceived as having more stable financial positions and greater capacity to fulfill dividend commitments. Furthermore, these companies are recognized for their consistent practice of regularly increasing dividends, a characteristic that holds a particular allure for investors. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades.', 'Also read: 12 Dogs of the Dow Dividend Stocks to Buy', 'That said, a Wall Street Journal report has provided insights into the performance of small- and mid-cap (SMID) dividend-paying stocks over the years. According to the report, these stocks have historically demonstrated appealing income, total returns, and lower risk. Citing data from Empirical Research Partners, the report highlighted that SMID dividend payers delivered an annual return of 15.68% from 1975 to June 2023, surpassing both large-cap dividend payers and the overall stock market. Additionally, the volatility of these SMID dividend-paying stocks was approximately 15% lower than that of the average SMID stock. The distinctions become even more significant when considering SMID stocks that consistently increase the dividends they distribute to shareholders. Over the past 35 years, these dividend-growers have achieved more attractive annualized gains while exhibiting less risk compared to the average SMID dividend payer.', 'In view of these arguments, we will discuss 11 dogs of the Russell 2000 in this article.', 'Photo by Dan Dennis on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'We began with a pool of 2000 stocks from the Russell 2000 and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection.

The results will primarily center around the company’s vehicle deliveries and profit margins. While fourth-quarter deliveries set records and beat our model estimates, shrinking margins might act as a spoiler.', 'Notably, TSLA surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 3.22%. Before we delve into the factors that are set to shape its upcoming results, here’s a snapshot of its third-quarter 2023 earnings report.', ""(Also read:\xa0Insights Into Expectations From Tesla's Q4 Earnings)"", 'Tesla snapped its 10-quarter winning streak in the third quarter of 2023. The electric vehicle (EV) titan reported earnings per share of 66 cents, which declined from the year-ago figure of $1.05 and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Total revenues came in at $23,350 million, witnessing year-over-year growth of 9%. The top line, however, fell short of the consensus mark of $24,381 million.', 'Tesla’s third-quarter production totaled 430,488 units (416,800 Model 3/Y and 13,688 Model S/X), up 18% year over year and surpassing our estimate of 415,645 units. The company delivered 435,059 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 27% and topping our estimate of 428,141 units. The Model 3/Y registered deliveries of 419,074 vehicles, marking year-over-year growth of 29% and outpacing our projection by 7,999 units. Deliveries of the Model S/X totaled 13,688 units, down 31% from the year-ago levels and below our estimate of 17,066 units.', 'Tesla had cash/cash equivalents of $26,077 million as of Sep 30, 2023. Long-term debt and finance leases, net of the current portion, totaled $2,426 million, up from $1,597 million on Dec 31, 2022. The company generated FCF of $848 million during the reported quarter, which declined from $3,297 million generated in the year-ago period.', 'The company reported record deliveries of 484,507 deliveries during the fourth quarter. The delivery numbers rose 19.5% and 11.4% on a yearly and sequential basis, respectively. \xa0Additionally, it exceeded our model projection of 476,620 units.', 'Tesla’s models 3 and Y are the company’s most successful EVs, accounting for most of its sales. For the quarter, Tesla delivered 461,538 of those, surpassing our forecast of 457,892 units.', 'Fourth-quarter delivery performance was propelled by robust sales of the Model 3 in the United States, particularly before the phase-out of federal tax credits for specific variants under the Inflation Reduction Act. The conclusion of these tax incentives is likely to have played a role in the surge of fourth-quarter deliveries, as consumers hastened to capitalize on the advantages before their expiration. To stimulate deliveries by the end of December, the company implemented various incentives, including heightened discounts and a six-month provision of complimentary fast charging.', 'Fueled by the delivery surge, our forecasts imply 5% year-over-year growth in automotive revenues, projecting the metric to reach $22.38 billion.', 'Nevertheless, substantial discounts on models in the United States, China, and other regions are anticipated to exert downward pressure on its gross margins. High costs of raw materials and logistical constraints\xa0are expected to have an adverse impact on overall results.\xa0We project the cost of automotive sales to rise more than 16% to around $18 billion.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?"", ""Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Motors Company (GM)."", 'General Motors Company currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 10% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GM', 'Check price target & stock forecast for General Motors Company here>>>The ABR suggests buying General Motors Company, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is GM a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for General Motors Company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $7.50.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for General Motors Company.

This isn’t new,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. “We need Boeing to succeed. But they’ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.”', 'Kirby made his comments after the airline warned investors that it will report a larger-than-expected loss in the first three months of this year because of the grounding of all 737 Max 9 jets after a door plug blew off on an Alaska Air flight on January 5, leaving a massive hole in the side of the plane.', 'The plane landed without any serious injuries, but the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and additional inspections of the more than 200 jets of that model worldwide.', 'United Airlines said it now expects its fleet of Boeing Max 9 jets to remain grounded through the end of this month, and that the company will report a first quarter loss in the range of $116 million to $262 million. That’s more than the $138 million loss already forecast by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.', 'United has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm.', 'Beyond the current 737 Max 9 problem is what this means for Boeing’s orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA. It will be at least five years in a best case scenario before Boeing can delivery those Max 10 jets to United, Kirby said, and the airline is now no longer counting on getting that plane in the future.', '“I think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel’s back for us,” said Kirby. “We’re going to build a plan that doesn’t have the Max 10 in it.”', 'United has firm orders for 277 of the 737 Max 10, and options to buy an additional 200, and so if the airline were to pull out of those orders, it would be a massive blow for Boeing’s efforts to bring that plane to market.', 'And in a call with investors later in the day, Kirby said that the airline is not quite canceling the orders that it has for the Max 10, but it doesn’t anticipate it’ll be receiving the jets, either.', '“We are taking it out of our internal plans,” said Kirby. “And we’ll be working on what that means exactly with Boeing. But Boeing is not going to be able to meet their contractual deliveries on at least many of those airplanes. And let’s leave it at that.”', 'United has orders for more than 500 Boeing jets in total on the books, more than twice as many as it does for jets from its rival Airbus. But in the last six months, United took delivery of its first A321neo, a model that directly competes with the Boeing 737 Max.', 'But thanks to a deep order backlog at both companies, even if United were to drop its 737 Max 10 purchase plans, it would probably be forced to buy other 737 Max models rather than getting at the end of the line for buyers of Airbus jets.', 'That will constrain the company for quite some time, Kirby added.', '“We’re still going to be the fastest growing airline,” Kirby said. “But we’re not going to be as fast growing as we planned.”', 'Boeing would not comment directly on United’s comments on its orders, other than to once again apologize for the problems that led to the incident at Alaska Air and the subsequent 737 Max 9 grounding.', '“We have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers,” said Stan Deal, head of Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, in a statement released by the company. “We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.”', 'Boeing has had a series of quality issues that have dogged the aircraft maker for the last five years, ever since two fatal crashes of the 737 Max 8 in late 2018 and early 2019 led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.', 'United believes it is getting close to the completion of the inspections it needs to get approval to fly the 737 Max 9 once again, Kirby said.', '“I have a lot of confidence in the safety of these airplanes, particularly since we know what happened with this Max 9,” he said. “I think we’re near the end game of getting that [model] back flying.”', 'United did say it expects full year earnings of between $9 to $11 a share, a range which would include the current estimates of full-year earnings of $9.45 a share according to analysts, as well as 2023 earnings of $10.05 a share that it reported Monday.', 'And it reported fourth-quarter earnings of $2.00 a share, topping the $1.69 a share forecast by analysts.', 'The earnings beat and the full-year guidance helped to lift shares of United more than 5% in trading Tuesday.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

The FAA is still reviewing data from inspections of an initial group of 40 planes and has not said when it may allow the grounded MAX 9 jets to resume flights.', 'The FAA on Sunday urged operators of 737-900ER planes with door plugs to immediately inspect them after some airlines had noted ""findings with bolts"" during maintenance inspections.', 'MAX 10 DELAYS', ""After disappointing MAX 9 sales, Boeing is betting on the larger-capacity MAX 10 to dent the runaway lead of Airbus's A321neo at the busiest end of the market."", 'Analysts say a full rollout of the MAX line-up is crucial to help Boeing stabilize its roughly 40% share against Airbus and generate sufficient cash.', ""In the best-case scenario, MAX 10 deliveries are five years behind their original delivery date, United's Kirby estimated."", 'He later said United would not cancel the jets, just remove them from internal plans.

The University of Michigan's recent report indicates an upswing in optimism. This surge in sentiment comes hand in hand with a decline in inflation expectations, signaling a potential shift in the economic landscape.The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment for January stands at an impressive 78.8, the highest since July 2021 and a significant leap from December's 69.7. This unexpected positive turn is occurring against a backdrop of a robust stock market, a healthy job market and stable gasoline prices.One of the key takeaways is the decline in consumers' inflation expectations for the next 12 months to 2.9%, the lowest level since December 2020. This shift in expectations, down from 3.1% in December, aligns with a range observed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prospect of lower inflation is welcomed news for the Federal Reserve, potentially opening the door for interest rate cuts in the coming months.This surge in confidence could play a pivotal role in allaying fears of an impending recession. Despite inflation and high interest rate concerns, Americans maintained a spending spree driven by strong employment and wage gains.Investors, in light of these positive developments, should consider strategic opportunities in the market. Sectors that traditionally thrive in times of economic optimism, such as retail, may present compelling investment avenues.

Despite near-term concerns, the company reiterated its outlook to double revenues in 2023, reported strong design win momentum, and indicated opportunity pipeline growth. Navitas sells monolithically integrated GaN power integrated circuit chips (completed printed circuit systems on a chip), which provide greater reliability and performance compared to competitors that supply discrete power devices (multiple individual, larger components put together on a chip). It recently purchased a silicon control company to drive integration and performance even further, and its SiC products offer high performance across many different applications.

You win by finding great companies and then buying and holding them. Your investment will grow in value as the underlying businesses grow.', ""So, how do you apply that mindset to technology stocks, where it's often a matter of disrupting your competition or being disrupted? It can be tricky, but there are bonafide winners with the size and fundamentals to continue thriving for years."", ""Here are five of the very best companies in the tech sector. Consider adding these to a diversified portfolio, and you'll get richer while sleeping well at night."", 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot trend on Wall Street. Still, AI will likely grow and develop over the coming decades. Chip company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has quickly established itself as the chip kingpin of this new era. Its graphics processing chips specialize in demanding applications, and that natural fit catapulted the company to an estimated AI chip market share between 80% and 95%.', ""It's hard to see Nvidia completely losing that market share, even if competitors chip away at it over time. The companies investing in AI are spending billions of dollars, which could make it harder to get them to switch from what's already working. AI unlocked a new level of growth at Nvidia last year, but AI's long-term potential means that the stock should enjoy years of growth."", ""Modern technology is built on the cloud -- centralized servers and data centers that shift computing power off organizations' premises. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might have built its reputation on e-commerce, but its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, is the world's leader. That makes the stock a no-brainer long-term buy and hold."", ""Today, Amazon holds nearly a third of the global cloud platform market, meaning that most of your online web activity at least touches AWS at one point or another. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market is expected to grow by 20% annually through the decade's end, which will almost certainly trickle to AWS. Add in Amazon's other business units, and the future looks bright."", ""Data has arguably become the critical resource companies and governments crave in this modern world. Data helps companies know their customers, themselves, and their competitors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)\xa0(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has arguably the most data of any company on Earth thanks to its decades of dominance in Google Search and YouTube. These are the world's two most heavily trafficked sites."", ""For investors, Alphabet's massive audience gives it many billions of dollars in high-margin advertising revenue, which helped the company bring in over $77 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months alone. The company's data, deep pockets, and AI potential mean that Alphabet will likely leverage itself into years of growth ahead."", ""Social media has become a regular part of daily life for people worldwide, and nobody does it better than Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, making money by showing ads to the 3.96 billion people using its apps monthly. The company's a cash cow, generating $37 billion in cash flow over the past year, and invests heavily into new opportunities, like AI and the metaverse via Reality Labs."", ""Studies have shown that social media is addictive, which, admittedly, probably isn't great for its users' mental health but makes Meta Platforms' core business very sticky. While many of the world's largest companies are led by outsiders, Meta is still headed by its co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who is only 39. He's built the company into the tech giant it is today, so long-term investors should feel great about Meta's future."", ""Cybersecurity has become one of the most critical pieces of any corporate budget. Getting hacked or suffering a data breach can cost a company millions in financial and reputational damage. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD) is part of a new generation of security companies, leaning on AI and cloud technology to provide security that learns in real-time, something legacy solutions like antivirus software can't match."", ""CrowdStrike is by far the youngest company on this list, but it's established itself as a leader in its field. Notably, the business is already quite profitable despite still chasing revenue growth. More than 23,000 organizations use CrowdStrike, which sells its products in modules. Customers buy access to more modules as CrowdStrike expands its offerings, leading to durable growth from adding new customers and cross-selling to existing ones. Cybersecurity isn't going anywhere, making CrowdStrike a security leader to hold onto."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

For most of the PC era, volatility in the memory chip market tended to wipe out the stock's gains whenever an inevitable downturn occurred. So devastating was this trend that at one point in 2016, Micron stock traded at 1994 levels."", 'However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) brought about a secular bull market in the memory chip market. Consequently, Micron is better positioned to ride out bear markets, and with that improvement, it reached a $98 billion market cap. But does that mean the stock can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035?', 'At a $98 billion market cap, a stock has to rise by around 24% annually to reach $1 trillion by 2035. Micron stock has risen by nearly 50% over the last year, which seems promising at first glance.', 'Unfortunately for Micron investors, at least one bear market will likely occur during the next 11 years, so investors need to take a longer-term view of the stock.', 'Over the last five years, the stock has risen by around 140%. That amounts to an annual gain of just over 19%, indicating it would fail to match the needed growth rate. Additionally, the 10-year gain of about 285% would mean gains of just over 14%. While that 10-year period accounts for a time when AI was not benefiting Micron significantly, that level of increase does not bode well for reaching that goal.', 'Despite its uncertain prospects over the next 11 years, it will likely rise. Admittedly, its chips lack some of the cachet enjoyed by a company like Nvidia.', ""Nonetheless, it developed a chip that supports generative AI applications. Nvidia selected Micron's high-bandwidth memory chip (called the HBM3E) to power its H200 chip for data centers. Given Nvidia's massive gains and the considerable increases in Advanced Micro Devices stock after it released its AI processor, Micron stock could experience similar gains."", ""Micron's financials have already shown signs of improvement. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Nov. 30, 2023, revenue of $4.7 billion increased by 16% year over year. However, for the second quarter, Micron projects revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion. That would amount to a 44% annual revenue increase at the midpoint."", 'Additionally, though it lost $1.2 billion in fiscal Q1, inventory write-downs of more than $1.8 billion caused this loss. That increases the likelihood that it could return to profitability soon.', 'Also, while the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6 may look inexpensive, that sales multiple is at a multiyear high. Nonetheless, that is well below the P/S ratios of AMD and Nvidia, and with Micron firmly on the AI train, investors may become more tolerant of higher valuations.', ""Given current conditions, a $1 trillion market cap in the next 11 years is possible, but investors should not expect it. Micron's move into AI chips is bullish for the stock. This factor and the chip demand driven by AI make it likely the stock will outperform the S&P 500."", 'However, investors should assume that bear markets will negatively affect Micron more than they would with AMD and Nvidia. That factor dramatically reduces the odds of Micron reaching a $1 trillion market cap in the next 11 years.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

With some saying AI and machine learning (ML) could be as transformational to business as the internet, it's best to roll with it. Especially because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes AI will impact 40% of jobs globally."", 'AI/ML is an expansive area, so it may be tough to know where to start. Just a few examples of the technology include:', 'Speech recognition (great for automobiles and drive-thru kiosks)', 'Chatbots (terrific for online customer service and many other functions)', 'Cybersecurity applications', 'Virtual assistants', 'Autonomous vehicles', 'Factory robotics', 'Medical research and diagnosis', ""While the arena is massive, there are a few popular companies investors should know right off the bat. I'll start right at the top with heavyweights Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\xa0and then up-and-comers like Palantir (NYSE: PLTR)\xa0and UiPath (NYSE: PATH)."", ""Nvidia is among the most important companies because of its high-powered, essential data center hardware and software. Without Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and other products, AI applications would be difficult to execute. This has brought the company incredible success, which the infographic below depicts."", 'First, we can see that total revenue increased 205% year over year (YOY) to $18 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 on the back of data center revenue, which increased 278% to $14.5 billion -- a ridiculous clip. Even more incredible, data center growth accelerated in Q3 of fiscal year 2024, eclipsing 171% in Q2.', ""The next major takeaway is the company's operating income (center of the graphic). It soared 1,633% to $10.4 billion on a 57% margin. Nvidia's profits skyrocketed because demand was higher than supply. They cannot produce enough to satisfy their customers, so they have pricing power."", 'Nvidia has some challenges, like U.S. restrictions on exports to China and competition working hard; however, Nvidia creates new chips that meet export requirements to China, and it has a significant head start on competitors like Advanced Micro Devices\xa0and Intel.', ""Trading at 74 times earnings, the stock isn't cheap and likely won't be anytime soon. This drops to 46x on a forward basis (compared to Microsoft\xa0at 35x), which is more palatable."", ""Wall Street has a history of underestimating Nvidia's future earnings. Still, be cautious at the current price or consider dollar-cost averaging."", ""In late 2022, Alphabet found itself caught flat-footed when OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the stage, and Microsoft invested billions to bring the generative AI tech to Bing. Suddenly, there was serious competition for Google Search -- Alphabet's gravy train that produced $127 billion in revenue through Q3 2023, 57% of the company's total sales."", ""Luckily, Alphabet has studied AI for years and has many solutions that have come out or are coming soon. There is Bard, Alphabet's answer to ChatGPT. Alphabet recently upgraded Bard with its Gemini tech to enhance its performance."", 'Google Search has new features that allow users to search with a picture, optimize translation services, and provide more relevant results. The company developed its own chip, the tensor processing unit (TPU), for generative AI applications. Perhaps the ChatGPT release was the kick in the pants Alphabet needed to get its AI program to the market.', ""Alphabet's sales are up 7% YOY through Q3 2023 to $221 billion; however, growth accelerated to 11% in the last quarter. More impressively, cash from operations is up 22% this year, reaching $83 billion to show that Alphabet is still a cash-flow machine. The stock is fairly valued, trading close to its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27."", ""Amazon is among the most exciting AI companies because it benefits from AI on multiple fronts. Generative AI software requires massive data processing, much of which runs through the cloud. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest provider of cloud services. Growth at AWS slowed in 2023 because companies cut their data usage budgets in anticipation of a recession, but AI and increased budgets could turn this around in 2024."", 'The company also uses AI in digital advertising and logistics, and Amazon Bedrock provides foundational models for companies to tailor AI applications to their needs.', 'While AWS growth slowed in 2023, areas like digital advertising thrived, and Amazon grew total revenue by 11% through Q3 2023 to $405 billion. Positive free cash flow and net income also returned after a difficult 2022.', 'The stock trades well below its recent averages based on operating cash flow and sales, as shown below.', 'The valuation and opportunity make Amazon stock an alluring buy.', 'Palantir has been unapologetically hyping its AI prowess since before AI was the thing to be. The company helps governments and businesses manage, analyze, visualize, and act on data. It also provides a platform where clients can build and deploy applications, and its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software expands on this by using AI to enhance logical decision-making.', ""Palantir is a critical partner in the defense industry and is making strides in the private sector. Last quarter, private sector sales increased 23% YOY to $251 million, while government sales grew 12% to $308 million. Palantir also achieved its fourth straight quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits, has $3.3 billion in cash and investments, and has no long-term debt. It's no wonder it's a popular stock. Still, its 17% YOY growth last quarter may not justify its current valuation of 17x sales."", 'UiPath is getting some well-deserved attention lately. The company is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA). RPA has many use cases that get to the heart of AI/ML: efficiency.', 'For instance, picture a large company that receives hundreds of invoices daily through email. Instead of manually downloading and inputting them (as is the case now), RPA does this automatically with minimal human intervention. This is why UiPath reported $1.4 billion annual recurring revenue on 24% growth and over 10,800 customers last quarter.', 'There is intense industry competition, namely from Microsoft, which gives investors pause. However, the company is on firm financial footing, reporting $1.75 billion in cash and investments with no long-term debt, and trades for just 10x sales. This makes UiPath a very compelling stock for growth-oriented investors.', 'Many terrific companies are doing innovative things in AI. Of these popular companies, I think Amazon and UiPath are the most intriguing buys based on potential and valuation; however, each name has a lot to like.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasn't one of them.

That was the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG), which finished the year up 46%. Growth stocks were big winners last year, driven by low valuations at the start of 2023 after 2022's bear market and excitement about new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022."", ""The Vanguard Growth Fund is a popular ETF, but less well-known than those that track the S&P 500 and other major indexes. Let's take a closer look at the ETF, discuss what investors should know about it, and whether it's likely to beat the broad market again this year."", 'The Vanguard Growth ETF is a large-cap growth fund that tracks the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index.', 'The fund holds 207 stocks and, like the Invesco QQQ ETF and other funds that track the Nasdaq-100, it\'s highly concentrated among the largest S&P 500 stocks. For example, more than 25% of the fund is made up of just Apple and Microsoft, and the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which also includes Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, makes up about half of the fund.', ""Unlike the Nasdaq-100 ETFs, the Vanguard Growth Fund also includes stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange such as Eli Lilly, Visa, and McDonald's."", 'The Vanguard Growth Fund has a low expense ratio of 0.04%, meaning it costs almost nothing in fees to hold it, and it offers a modest dividend yield of 0.6%. The fund has total net assets of $200 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs available.', ""The VUG enters 2024 trading at a high valuation, with its price-to-earnings ratio at 38. That's a reflection of the lofty multiples that many of its top holdings, including Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla, trade at, as nearly every stock in the Magnificent Seven trades at a premium to the S&P 500."", ""However, for many of those stocks, those premium valuations seem justified. Nvidia, for example, posted revenue growth of better than 200% in its most recent quarterly report, and its earnings per share jumped by more than 12 times. That surge won't last forever, but it's one piece of evidence that shows that 2024 earnings are likely to be significantly higher than 2023 earnings for at least some of the biggest holdings in the VUG. Amazon similarly reported net income up more than 200% in its third-quarter report, as the company has cut costs, focused on efficiencies, and grown into warehouse capacity. And Meta's third-quarter profit more than doubled as well."", ""Following Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's recent earnings report, there are also signs of a recovery in the semiconductor sector, which could lift profits at member stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments."", 'The new year is young, but the Vanguard Growth Fund already has a slight edge over both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite this year.

Rising interest rates in 2022 were a big reason why growth stocks and tech stocks crashed and underperformed the broad market.', 'The expected interest rate cuts alone might not be enough to push this particular Vanguard fund to another win, but those, along with the strength in the Magnificent Seven, the ongoing AI boom, and expectations of a recovery in the economy, make the Vanguard Growth ETF well-positioned in 2024.', ""It's a good bet to outperform the S&P 500 again this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Index Funds-Vanguard Growth ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds-Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard Index Funds-Vanguard Growth ETF wasn't one of them.

And shares in the industry leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), ballooned 237% over the last 12 months as its revenue and profits soared. This stemmed from rising demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for running and training the most advanced AI applications. "", ""Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock rose 137% in the same period. But unlike Nvidia, AMD's rally was more based on future expectations (third-quarter revenue grew just 4% compared to Nvidia's 206%). So, in 2024, AMD will have to prove itself deserving of all the hype.\xa0"", 'Since it acquired ATI Technologies in 2006, AMD has been a direct competitor to Nvidia in the market for GPUs. These computer chips work by running multiple tasks simultaneously (parallel processing) -- a technique that turned out to have huge potential for training the vast amounts of data required for generative artificial intelligence applications. ', 'And the potential market for AI-capable enterprise GPUs makes the video game industry look like a chump change. ', ""According to AMD, the $45 billion AI chip market could rise almost tenfold to $400 billion by 2027. To take advantage of the opportunity, AMD has released its MI300X family of chips designed to compete with Nvidia's flagship H100 for AI data center clients. "", ""AMD's management expects the new chips to generate $2 billion in additional sales in 2024, which is somewhat modest considering the potentially huge total addressable market. However, analysts at Barclays believe this number could be closer to $4 billion. And this would represent an 18% growth rate compared to AMD's trailing-12-month revenue, assuming all its other businesses remain constant. "", ""That's a lot of growth to get from one type of product. And if AMD's lofty projections about AI chip demand hold true, investors should expect sales to scale up dramatically between 2025 and 2027. "", 'But even in the best-case scenario, AMD still lags behind Nvidia, which saw its data center chip business add $4.9 billion in sales between the second and third quarters of calendar year 2023 alone.', ""With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43, AMD's stock is dramatically more expensive than Nvidia, which trades for a comparatively modest 29 times projected earnings. This disparity is surprising considering Nvidia's significantly faster growth rate and faster product release/update cycle, which can lead to better pricing power. "", ""That said, investors shouldn't see artificial intelligence as a zero-sum game. The market is growing fast enough for many companies to succeed.\xa0And although later to market than its rival, AMD could establish a niche through lower prices and better value for money.

That creates a significant opportunity for investors. Businesses are racing to improve productivity with predictive insights and automation, and that secular trend should drive many stocks higher in 2024 and beyond.', ""The most prudent way to capitalize on that trend is to build a basket of AI stocks. Here's why now is a good time to add shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) to that basket."", 'Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in running complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI)\xa0applications. The company has regularly achieved top scores at the MLPerf benchmarks, the industry standard in benchmarking the performance of machine learning (ML) hardware, software, and services across training and inference use cases. And Nvidia holds more than 80% market share in AI/ML chips, according to analysts.', 'However, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy. To elaborate, Nvidia has extended its data center hardware portfolio to include networking equipment and central processing units (CPUs) purpose-built for AI, and both have become multibillion-dollar businesses. The company has also branched into subscription software and cloud services to simplify the development of AI applications, and those products have become a billion-dollar business.', 'Management sees those three adjacencies -- networking, CPUs, and software and services -- as key growth drivers because they extend its ability to monetize AI. Additionally, with products addressing every layer of the AI stack -- infrastructure, software, and services -- Nvidia is an even more compelling option for businesses. To that end, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino believes its ""full-stack AI/software capabilities provide an incredible competitive advantage.""', 'Grand View Research expects the GPU market to grow roughly 28% annually through 2030. When coupled with growth in other AI spending categories, that tailwind could translate into annual sales growth above 25% for Nvidia, which makes its current valuation of 30.9 times sales seem tolerable.', 'As a caveat, that multiple is a premium to the three-year average of 23.5 times sales, but investors with a five-year time horizon should still consider buying a small position today. Nvidia will probably command a premium valuation for the foreseeable future.', 'Amazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe, and it has become the third-largest ad tech company in the world. The company is using AI to make both businesses more efficient and profitable. For instance, Amazon uses ML models to optimize inventory and logistics routes, and it recently launched a generative AI tool that helps brands create marketing content.', 'However, Amazon is truly primed to monetize AI because it has a dominant position in cloud computing. Indeed, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services in the most recent quarter, while its closest competitor, Microsoft Azure, held 23% market share. That means AWS is arguably the cloud provider best positioned to support businesses as they experiment with AI, and its status as a leader in cloud AI developer services makes that argument even more credible.', 'Additionally, AWS has launched new generative AI products. Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that supports the development of generative AI applications. And Code Whisperer is an AI-enabled copilot for software developers. The company also announced Amazon Q,\xa0a generative AI business assistant that can automate tasks and surface insights across a range of systems and data sources, including external products from Microsoft and Salesforce.', 'With that in mind, Morningstar analysts expect Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually through 2027, driven by particularly strong momentum in digital advertising and cloud computing. That estimate makes its current valuation of 2.8 times sales seem fair, especially when the three-year average is 3 times sales.', 'Datadog provides observability and cybersecurity software that helps businesses monitor IT infrastructure and resolve performance issues. Its platform leans on AI to surface insights, detect anomalies, and automate root cause analysis. Datadog is a recognized leader in several software verticals, including application performance monitoring, log monitoring, and AI for IT operations.', 'Observability software becomes increasingly essential as IT environments become more complex. That means digital transformation projects, like cloud migration and AI deployment, are tailwinds for Datadog. But the company has further cemented its ability to monetize AI with two new products.', 'First, LLM Observability is a performance monitoring solution for generative AI applications and the underlying large language models. Second, Bits AI is a conversational copilot that helps development and operations teams investigate and resolve problems more quickly.', 'Datadog expects its addressable market to increase at 11% annually to reach $62 billion in 2026,\xa0but the company should grow much faster. In fact, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin believes Datadog could become the ""fastest growing software company"" as the generative AI boom unfolds, and the Wall Street consensus calls for sales to increase at 26% annually over the next five years. That outlook makes its current valuation of 20.6 times sales seem reasonable.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for McKesson the TSR over the last 5 years was 306%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's nice to see that McKesson shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 32% per year, is even more impressive.

Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities. We added to the position after a couple of positive developments this quarter. First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer."", 'Alan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report exceptional top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income earnings per share and return on equity were all record highs, driven by both underwriting and investment results. Our underwriting gains were broad-based in each of our three segments underlying underwriting income was higher and prior year development was favorable. Catastrophe losses were also light. Record underlying underwriting income resulted from net earned premiums of $10 billion, up more than 13% over the prior year quarter and an underlying combined ratio, which improved 5.5 points to a record 85.9%. Looking at our two commercial segments together.', 'The aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 85.9% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was coincidentally also 85.9%, an improvement of more than 10 points year-over-year. In addition, we are pleased to have delivered full year core income of $3.1 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.5%. Notwithstanding elevated industry wide catastrophe losses earlier in the year and a personal lines operating environment that while improving was difficult during the year. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after tax net investment income of $645 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio.', 'Our operating results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year, after making important investments in our business and returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to the topline. We grew net written premiums by 13% to $10 billion in the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $40 billion. All three segments contributed to our topline success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change remained high at 11.8%. Our retention also remained high at 87%. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a disciplined marketplace.', 'The segment generated $672 million of new business in the quarter, which is a $118 million or about 20% higher than in the prior year quarter. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% to $989 million, driven by excellent production in our surety business, where net written premiums were up 9%. Production was also strong in our management liability business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in home and 16.7% in our auto business. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $2 billion of written premium in this segment over the past year.', ""With another strong production -- with another year of strong production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to take a minute and put our 2023 results into an overtime context with an update to some data we shared previously. A half dozen or so years ago, we laid out a focused innovation strategy, ensure that if we were successful in this execution, we would expect to grow our business at attractive returns. A reflection of our belief that any strategy to achieve industry-leading returns over time requires a strategy to grow over time. The data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation show the success we've achieved."", ""Starting at the top left corner. In terms of the top line, we've grown net written premiums at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past seven years, that's 2.5 times our rate of growth from 2012 to 2016. The growth rate in each of the past two years was double-digits, the result of a deliberate and tailored strategy, stronger pricing where we need it and a combination of pricing and unit growth where we like the opportunity. In Business Insurance, we've added more than $4 billion to our top line over the past two years. The investments we've made in capabilities to enhance the franchise value that we offer to our customers and distribution partners have contributed to strong retentions and growth in new business. In Bond & Specialty, we've increased net written premiums over that period by about $0.5 billion or 14%."", ""More than half of that growth has come from a very profitable surety business, where our market leading position has enabled us to benefit from increased demand for bonds with higher contract values and projects resulting from the Federal Infrastructure and Jobs Act and other federal programs. Across both of our commercial segments, since 2021, we have about doubled our E&S writings to around $2.5 billion. That includes organic growth from the E&S business we write in National Property, our North field business and our Lloyd's business, as well as the impact of more recent strategic efforts, which include our relationships with Fidelis and Corvus. The margins in our E&S business are quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, where margins have not been at target levels in recent periods."", ""Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over the past two years has been almost entirely a result of price increases. The PI team has done an excellent job of threading the needle, maintaining a strong customer base while achieving meaningful pricing gains. They've also done a great job with private product management. Our advanced peril-by-peril Quantum Auto 2.0 offering now represents more than 60% of the domestic property portfolio. And adoption of our telematics product and teledrive among new customers has been strong. With pricing gains and enhanced product sophistication, the book should contribute to our earnings power going forward as we move to our target returns. Also important is that across all three segments, we've grown mostly in products, classes of business and geographies and through distribution partners that we know well, that gives us a lot of confidence in the business we're adding to the books."", ""Moving to the right, you can see that while we've meaningfully increased our rate of growth, we've maintained very strong and consistent underlying profitability. That demonstrates that we're not growing by underpricing the business or compromising our underwriting discipline. We've grown by investing in the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. We've also grown through a lot of great hustle and hard work on the part of our outstanding field organization. One of the clear strategic objectives of our innovation strategy has been to optimize productivity and efficiency. Moving to the top right of the slide, you can see that over the last seven years, we've reduced our expense ratio by 3.6 points to just over 28% for 2023, which is more than a 10% reduction relative to our 2012 to 2016 expense ratio of around 32%."", ""Enhanced operating leverage gives us the flexibility to let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or invest further in our strategic priorities. Case in point, as you can see on Slide 21, since 2017, we have doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over a seven year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend, improve the strategic mix of that spend, and lowered our expense ratio. The upshot of what we've accomplished on the top half of Slide 19 is what you see on the bottom half. On the bottom left, you can see that we've increased underlying underwriting income significantly."", ""From 2012 to 2019, underlying underwriting income averaged $1.3 billion. In 2020, we crossed the $2 billion mark and 2023 marks the first time that we've exceeded $3 billion. We've taken our underlying underwriting income to a meaningfully higher level. We've also significantly increased our cash flow from operations to more than $7.5 billion in 2023. The fourth consecutive year it's been more than $6 billion and more than double our average cash flow from operations in the earlier part of the last decade. Cash flow isn't a metric that we or our industry talk a lot about, but it's important. It's what gives us the ability to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. We've grown our investment portfolio significantly to nearly $93 billion."", ""As we continue to reinvest our fixed income portfolio at higher rates, this is a highly reliable lever of earnings and value creation. To sum it up through a well-executed strategy, we've more than doubled our rate of growth, sustained strong underlying underwriting margins and meaningfully lowered our expense ratio. That has resulted in record levels of underlying underwriting income, cash flow and invested assets. Ultimately, of course, one number that brings everything together is adjusted book value per share. On Slide 20, you can see that we have steadily increased adjusted book value per share each year since 2006 at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. The effective management of our capital complements that result. We've increased our capital base to support the profitable growth of our business."", ""At the same time, we've been disciplined about returning excess capital to shareholders. Over this period, we've increased our dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 8% and returned more than $40 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of about $74 per share. These results, together with our track record of strong returns and low volatility demonstrate the strength of our business and the success of our overtime strategy. Looking ahead, we're very confident about how we're positioned for 2024 and beyond. The fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. We're confident that we're focused on the right strategic priorities and that with demonstrated success in execution, there's plenty more opportunity ahead of us."", ""And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan."", ""Dan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, and core return on equity was 24%, both all-time record quarterly results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.5 point improvement from last year's quarter. The combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to underlying underwriting income of $1.1 billion after tax, up $511 million or 89% from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio improved from the prior year in all three segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter improved by 0.5 point from last year's quarter to 27.4%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth."", ""The full year expense ratio of 28.1% was our best ever. As Alan mentioned, our focus is on operating leverage. And looking ahead to 2024, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio in the range of 28% to 28.5% for now. Our fourth quarter results include a modest $125 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses with no individually significant events impacting our book of business. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $132 million pre-tax, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $56 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in umbrella and general liability. Even after the reserve charge, the returns in both umbrella and GL remain very attractive."", 'In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by better than expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $40 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After tax net investment income of $645 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2024, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $2.6 billion after tax, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter and growing to approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter.', ""Page 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long standing CAT XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. And we've increased the amount of total coverage for 2024. Despite the growth in our property book, our attachment point remains steady, and the per occurrence loss deductible is unchanged at $100 million. For 2024, we have placed coverage for $3.5 billion of the $4.5 billion layer above the $3.5 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have obtained the extra protection in light of the recent inflationary impact on insured values. With context, we've never hit this treaty. Nonetheless, this is prudent, affordable balance sheet protection for tail events."", 'The cost of the additional reinsurance will be largely offset by the strong renewal pricing we continue to achieve on our direct written property premiums resulting in only a de minimis impact on the underlying combined ratio. On a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2024, we thought it would be helpful to once again highlight the seasonality of our CAT losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest CAT quarter. CAT losses in the second quarter have been, on average, more than three combined ratio points higher than in any other quarter and the second quarter has been our largest CAT quarter in seven of the past 10 years.', 'Also of interest for 2024, in light of continued strong pricing and terms in the E&S and reinsurance markets, we are pleased to share that we have renewed the 20% quota share with Fidelis. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had for 2023. The written premium volume, which will again be included as part of international within the Business Insurance segment is not expected to be material to the segment. but should have a modestly favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio for 2024 as it earns in. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As you may have seen, S&P issued their updated capital model, and we now expect that the result of the new model will be a modest improvement in their assessment of our capital metrics.', ""Interest rates decreased and spreads narrowed during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.5 billion after tax at September 30 to $3.1 billion after tax at year end. As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have a little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $122.90 at year end, up 8% from a year ago."", 'We returned $298 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $66 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Thinking about share repurchases in 2024, while there is no change in our capital management philosophy, we will factor in the need for increased capital in light of our top line growth as well as the $435 million we just deployed to complete the Corvus acquisition. Currently, we expect repurchases in the first quarter of somewhere around $250 million. Recapping our results for 2023. Core income was $3.1 billion, and core ROE was 11.5%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, earned premium, underlying underwriting income and cash flow from operations.', ""In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. We've never been better positioned for the year ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance."", ""Gregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Last year at this time, I indicated that we were firing on all cylinders, and that certainly remains the case today. Segment income for the quarter was $957 million, our highest quarter ever and up well over $200 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower catastrophes. The all-in combined ratio of 86.5% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.8% and an all-time best result."", ""The underlying loss ratio improved by almost 2.5 points from the prior year quarter, with the drivers of the improvement, including the benefit of earned pricing a mix shift to the property line and an impact from non-CAT weather that was modestly favorable to both the prior year and our expectations. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 14% from the prior year to a fourth quarter record of $5 billion, benefiting from high retention, strong renewal premium change and increase in new business levels. As Alan mentioned, given the attractive margins in this segment, we're very pleased with this growth. Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 11.8%, with renewal rate change of 7.4% and continued strong growth and exposure."", ""Renewal rate change increased from the third quarter in select and middle market, however, ticked down at the segment level, driven almost entirely by a lower mix of national property written premium in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Retention remained excellent at 87% and new business of $672 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. As for renewal rate change, during the quarter, we achieved meaningful renewal rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp."", ""The property, umbrella and auto lines led the way. Renewal rate change in each of the casualty lines was comparable or better than the third quarter. And given our high quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.9%, up more than 1.5 point (ph) from the third quarter driven by renewal rate change, which increased to 4.1% for the quarter. Even with strong pricing, retention remained very strong at 85%. New business was up $49 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product."", ""In middle market, renewal premium change of 10.4% and retention of 90% remained historically strong. New business of $348 million was an all-time best fourth quarter result. As we close out 2023, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income was nearly $2.6 billion, an exceptional result. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9%, top line of $20.4 billion renewal premium change, retention and new business premiums were all record results. These results are a direct reflection of our successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages."", 'For example, during the year, we continued to advance our data and analytics capabilities by leveraging evolving technologies, including AI, and new data sources to help us manage the portfolio and equip our frontline underwriters with data and insights to better enable our risk selection, underwriting and pricing. In addition, we continued to advance our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in all but a couple of states, as well as our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 14 states. Both products deliver industry-leading segmentation and user experiences. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing other industry leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us.', ""In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. In our Small Commercial business, we continued to roll out our new front end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, while maintaining all the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. We're proud of these extraordinary results in the best-in-class team that produce them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty ended a strong 2023 with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $240 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. delivered very strong underlying underwriting income and an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 80.6%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, in line with the prior year quarter, while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. New business was up driven by a new domestic cyber capacity agreement with Corvus. Surety net written premiums increased 9%, reflecting continued strong demand for surety bonds.', ""So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, capping off a year during which we generated record segment income and net written premium. Finally, we're pleased that earlier this month, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Corvus Insurance. Corvus is an industry leading cyber insurance managing general underwriter, powered by proprietary technology. Corvus has developed cutting edge capabilities, including digitally integrated cyber sales, underwriting, service and support, sophisticated underwriting algorithms and advanced vulnerability scanning. Corvus also brings deep cyber underwriting and risk management expertise, and we're pleased to welcome them to the Travelers family."", ""This acquisition affords us the opportunity to write Corvus' profitable book of business which will be reflected as new business in our production results over the course of 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael."", ""Michael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Personal Insurance generated $520 million of fourth quarter segment income, strong results and a significant improvement compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.9% improved over 10 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting improvements in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 13%, driven by continued elevated levels of renewal premium change in both auto and home bringing full year net written premiums to a record of nearly $16 billion. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%, the underlying combined ratio of 102.7% improved nearly 8 points compared to the prior year quarter."", 'This improvement was driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. To a lesser extent, it also benefited from the year-over-year impact of a modest favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year compared to a modest unfavorable re-estimation in the prior year quarter. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 70.8% improved by over 28 points, reflecting catastrophe losses that were favorable to both the prior year quarter and our expectations and an improved underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio improved 12.5 points, primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related losses that were favorable to both the prior year and our expectations and the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production.', ""Our results demonstrate our continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate actions to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile retention remained consistent. Renewal premium change of 16.7% remains strong and as expected, moderated from the third quarter of 2023 and as the majority of our book reached rate adequacy on a written basis. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024 as we continue to assess the environment and seek rate on a state-by-state basis as appropriate. We're pleased to note that auto new business increased relative to the prior year quarter, as we tempered our non-rate actions in states where we've achieved written rate adequacy. We will continue to evaluate our non-rate measures as more states reach adequacy throughout 2024."", ""In Homeowners and Other, retention remained consistent even as renewal premium change reached a record level at 21.2%, primarily driven by higher renewal rate change. As we noted last quarter, we expect homeowners' renewal premium change to moderate to low double-digits in 2024. We will continue to see great increases in response to elevated loss levels. But at the same time, our automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels, reflecting the progress we've made on aligning insured values with replacement costs. Our continued efforts to manage new business flow and thoughtfully deploy capacity in the face of market dislocation drove the year-over-year decline in homeowners new business and policies enforced during the quarter."", ""We anticipate this trend will continue as we take further actions to improve profitability and manage growth in property. In 2023, we made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business and are moving towards our goal of delivering target returns. While the environment remains dynamic, we're confident we're on a path to generating leading returns in Personal Insurance and growing profitably over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe."", ""Abbe Goldstein: Thanks very much.

In our view, only Blackwells’ highly qualified candidates are in a position to support Disney’s transformation efforts, adding expertise that is demonstrably lacking, while making sure the Disney Board doesn’t become a forum for personal grievances and reckless behavior. Moreover, Disney’s preliminary proxy statement paints a picture of a Board focused less on transforming the Company and more on preventing contrarian viewpoints and expertise from entering the boardroom.', 'Jason Aintabi, Chief Investment Officer of Blackwells, said, “According to Disney’s own preliminary proxy statement, Mr. Peltz has requested on behalf of Trian a seat on Disney’s Board no less than 24 times in the last year and a half. During that time, Mr. Peltz has not offered a single strategic idea that would benefit shareholders. Astoundingly, Mr. Peltz recently claimed that he would like ‘a guy who doesn’t have media experience’ on the Disney Board. We remind Mr. Peltz that Disney is a significant media company and, now more than any time in its history, needs Board members with deep media experience. Blackwells’ nominee, Jessica Schell, has more media experience than the Trian nominees combined, and would bring a critical perspective that is missing from the Disney Board.”', '“We also invite Ike Perlmutter, who represents the vast majority of the Trian shares of Disney, to engage with Blackwells with regards to our investment thesis for Disney, and to meet with our nominees. Mr. Perlmutter can then consider that our nominees will provide critical support in the areas of media and content, technology and real estate – the latter of which we believe represents up to 50% of the entire market value of Disney, and where, underwhelmingly, Disney has no such expertise on its Board. Additionally, with unprecedented innovation in AI, VR and AR, and more, Disney will benefit from Ms. Solivan’s experience in these fields, which is underrepresented on the current Disney Board.”', 'In listening to the views of Disney shareholders since the time of Blackwells’ first public engagement on Disney late last year, there has been an increasing desire by shareholders for additional support to Disney’s Board, provided it consists of additive expertise and constructive collaboration with existing Board members. The Disney Board has no shortage of issues to resolve, or courses to chart during this transformative time. Additional expertise should be welcomed, not brushed aside.', 'Mr. Aintabi concluded, “The Disney Board should promptly meet with the Blackwells nominees, in order to promote the free-flowing exchange of ideas that comes with constructive collaboration. On a related note, we remain particularly disappointed that Disney has entered into an information sharing agreement with ValueAct. Disney’s share price already suffers from a significant information discount, as recently noted by several key market analysts. Showering one shareholder with information that is withheld from all other shareholders, will only make matters worse. We therefore also demand that Disney agree to make public all information that is shared with ValueAct under the so-called ‘information sharing agreement’.”', 'About Blackwells Capital', 'Blackwells Capital was founded in 2016 by Jason Aintabi, its Chief Investment Officer.

But this time around, there will be blood.', ""Activists launching proxy battles typically have large mouths with small stock positions -- but that's not Peltz. Trian has amassed a roughly $3 billion stake in Disney. It's less than 2% of the shares outstanding but enough to make it one of the largest shareholders in the House of Mouse."", 'Last week, he was ripping Disney while on CNBC for putting out five consecutive theatrical releases that lost money, and it\'s fair to say that the Mickey Mouse company has fallen short at the multiplex lately. Last year was the first time since 2015 that Disney wasn\'t the leader in global box office receipts. Original properties have fallen flat, and even ""can\'t miss"" franchises have failed at the cinema.', ""Peltz is also justified in taking the board's corporate governance to task. Disney fumbled the succession strategy when Bob Chapek became CEO in early 2020, only to extend his contract just months before bringing Iger back to the helm. Peltz feels that Disney needs more tangible long-term goals, not just vague objectives like improving its operations of getting its streaming business to achieve profitability by the end of this fiscal year."", 'Disney has its weak spots. The shares have underperformed the market for three consecutive years, currently trading for less than half of the peak set 35 months ago. The targets are large, and Peltz knows where they are.', ""There are some duds in Petlz's quiver. He feels that Disney's direct-to-consumer business should be generating Netflix-esque profit margins of 15% to 20% by fiscal 2027. Netflix has been profitable for 20 consecutive years."", ""Disney is hoping that fiscal 2025 will be the first full year of Disney+ profitability. You can't ramp up a business that quickly, especially with so many moving parts, including the costly sports programming at ESPN+ and the licensing deals required to keep Hulu interesting."", ""Peltz feels that Disney needs to grow its theme parks and save costs elsewhere, but those goals are already in Disney's playbook. Even as Disney raises the annual savings it's hoping to achieve across its media empire, it recently announced plans to double expenditures to grow its theme park and cruise ship business over the next decade."", 'In the end, a proxy battle needs the majority of shareholders on its side to succeed. Peltz may have been able to pull this off two years ago when Disney was becoming a polarizing entity under Chapek, but the board brought back Iger to provide stability before things got out of hand. The stock also moved higher last year, even if it lagged the overall market.', ""Something as simple as resuming its dividend distributions last month should pacify some investors. The stock chart hasn't been kind, but Disney has posted healthy upticks in revenue for the last three fiscal years and continues to be the bellwether of entertainment stocks."", ""There may be valid knocks, but not enough to make this springtime annual shareholder meeting hostile.

A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB).

We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$119m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""While insiders are apparently happy to hold and accumulate shares, that is just part of the big picture. That's because on our analysis the CEO, Ren Jones, is paid less than the median for similar sized companies. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to M&T Bank, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m."", ""M&T Bank offered total compensation worth US$8.8m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally."", ""As previously touched on, M&T Bank is a growing business, which is encouraging. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. These factors alone make the company an interesting prospect for your watchlist, as well as continuing research. Now, you could try to make up your mind on M&T Bank by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry."", ""The good news is that M&T Bank is not the only growth stock with insider buying.

For most of the PC era, volatility in the memory chip market tended to wipe out the stock's gains whenever an inevitable downturn occurred. So devastating was this trend that at one point in 2016, Micron stock traded at 1994 levels."", 'However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) brought about a secular bull market in the memory chip market. Consequently, Micron is better positioned to ride out bear markets, and with that improvement, it reached a $98 billion market cap. But does that mean the stock can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035?', 'At a $98 billion market cap, a stock has to rise by around 24% annually to reach $1 trillion by 2035.

That amounts to an annual gain of just over 19%, indicating it would fail to match the needed growth rate. Additionally, the 10-year gain of about 285% would mean gains of just over 14%. While that 10-year period accounts for a time when AI was not benefiting Micron significantly, that level of increase does not bode well for reaching that goal.', 'Despite its uncertain prospects over the next 11 years, it will likely rise.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ended Nov. 30, 2023, revenue of $4.7 billion increased by 16% year over year. However, for the second quarter, Micron projects revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.5 billion. That would amount to a 44% annual revenue increase at the midpoint."", 'Additionally, though it lost $1.2 billion in fiscal Q1, inventory write-downs of more than $1.8 billion caused this loss. That increases the likelihood that it could return to profitability soon.', 'Also, while the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6 may look inexpensive, that sales multiple is at a multiyear high. Nonetheless, that is well below the P/S ratios of AMD and Nvidia, and with Micron firmly on the AI train, investors may become more tolerant of higher valuations.', ""Given current conditions, a $1 trillion market cap in the next 11 years is possible, but investors should not expect it. Micron's move into AI chips is bullish for the stock. This factor and the chip demand driven by AI make it likely the stock will outperform the S&P 500."", 'However, investors should assume that bear markets will negatively affect Micron more than they would with AMD and Nvidia.

Additionally, American Express registered $3.4 billion of net interest income that came from borrowers making payments on credit card balances outstanding. These are the two biggest revenue drivers for the business.', 'American Express has a history that spans almost two centuries. And during all of those years, the business has developed competitive advantages that make up its economic moat. This is why the company is able to stand out among the numerous other credit card issuers out there.', ""In this case, it's hard to deny that American Express is an extremely powerful and well-recognized global brand. The business targets a more affluent demographic, so there's a certain status or signaling factor about being an American Express cardholder. This is attractive to merchants because they want these consumers as their customers, due to their higher incomes and spending power. "", 'Moreover, like any two-sided payment platform, American Express benefits from network effects. There now are 138 million cards in circulation around the world and tens of millions of merchants that accept AmEx as a form of payment. The larger this network grows, the more valuable it becomes to all stakeholders.', ""In the past five years, American Express shares have returned 82%, matching the performance of the S&P 500. That's not all that impressive. If we zoom out further, though, say 30 years, AmEx is up nearly 2,200%, versus the broader index's 923% rise."", ""As of this writing, American Express trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 17.3. This is in line with the stock's trailing 10-year average. "", ""Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company's business continues posting strong growth. Revenue (net of interest expense) rose 13% in the most recent quarter, with diluted earnings per share soaring 34% from a year earlier. For 2024, management expects both of these figures to increase by double-digit percentages again, assuming there's no deterioration of economic conditions."", ""Given what I've outlined above, coupled with American Express's growth potential, the valuation seems totally reasonable right now.

That is going to be key here. Not just for setting the expectation for this upcoming meeting because there is an expectation that not much is going to change, but it is about March. That's the next marker here."", ""Because the market has run up ahead with the expectation, there could be a rate cut on the table. But, Rachelle, when you look at some of the economic data that's come out so far, CPI already out earlier this month, core CPI, core inflation, which is what Fed wants to look at, much stickier than expected. And, of course, even if you look at where the labor market is, we have seen surprising resilience there. So it will be interesting to see how this all plays out."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed, and we know the Fed said that they didn't want to jump the gun and start cutting rates before the job was actually done.

Not only are its margins great, but both Vertex's top and bottom lines have been experiencing significant growth in the past five years."", 'The big catalyst for the business since then has been Trikafta, which is sold under the name Kaftrio in Europe.

Those skeptics predicted the company’s coconut water would go from the next big thing to the next big afterthought.', '“I’m not a crazy type of competitive guy but I Iove proving people who bet against me wrong,” Kirban said during an hour-long interview from his New York City office. “A lot of it does come from my childhood. It’s a chip on my shoulder.”', 'Kirban grew up in Connecticut. Being dyslexic, he struggled in school, often getting shuttled back and forth between regular school and special education. Teachers asked what Kirban was going to do in life because he struggled to read and write. The negative feedback only “drove me to want to do more,” he recalled.', 'Today, Kirban, the executive chairman of The Vita Coco Company, continues to be fueled by cynics who question how much room the $674 million coconut water category, as defined through measured channels, has left to grow. The doubt comes even after Kirban has built a profitable, growing business from the ground up — managing to withstand changes in consumer behavior and competition from deep-pocked beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the process. ', '“They still doubt,” he said. “I get this question all the time. ‘Is it a fad? How big could it really be?’ We’ve been getting that question for 20 years.” ', 'Sitting in his office in New York City, Kirban is immersed in coconuts.', 'A framed picture on his wall contains an image of a coconut drawn by his daughter. The table next to his couch has a chess board with coconut-themed pieces. And the front of his desk proudly displays several of Vita Coco’s products, while nearby he has a green and white skateboard propped up against the wall that is adorned with the company’s logo.', 'Kirban fondly recalls how his company’s first office was seen at the time as all the space the upstart and its eight employees would ever need. Now, its New York office, with 100 employees, is quickly running out of space.', '“Twenty years ago, nobody knew what coconut water was. We’d have to explain that it’s the actual liquid from inside the coconut,” Kirban said. “Today, it’s nowhere near where it could be and where we think it will be one day.”', 'Vita Coco traces its roots back to a cold winter evening in 2003 when Kirban and his friend Ira Liran met two women from Brazil in a New York City bar. Liran later sold everything he had, married one of the women and moved to Brazil.', 'During that initial visit, Kirban and Liran found packaged coconut water as prevalent as bottled water on store shelves, and recognized an untapped market back in the U.S., the friends created the Vita Coco brand in 2004.', 'Initially, Vita Coco established a thriving business in grocery stores and later convenience and wholesale outlets.', 'In recent years, the company has marketed its coconut products aggressively to bars, restaurants and coffee shops to increase usage occasions and drive consumer awareness of the versatility of its offerings. Early last year, it launched a line of premium canned cocktails crafted with Captain Morgan rum and Vita Coco coconut water with Diageo.', '“They still doubt. I get this question all the time. ‘Is it a fad, How big could it really be?’ We’ve been getting that question for 20 years.”', 'Mike Kirban', 'Co-founder and executive chairman, The Vita Coco Company', 'Unlike once trendy drinks, such as kombucha that target improved gut health, Vita Coco promotes a diverse range of uses for its coconut water. The liquid can be added to smoothies, mixed drinks, cold brews, for hydration, following exercise or even as a way to nurse a hangover.', 'In a research note published in October, analysts at Goldman Sachs said Vita Coco is “a unique investment opportunity within non-alcoholic (and alcoholic) beverages.” The research firm said it sees “significant long-term) growth potential for COCO through a combination of increased household penetration for its branded business, distribution gains, price increases and a strong pipeline of innovation.”', 'Daniel McCarthy, an assistant marketing professor at Emory University, said while Vita Coco’s decision to bring its coconut products into other categories is a shrewd move, it’s unlikely to be as lucrative for the business as its prior endeavors.', ""“The challenge to me is, they've been so successful in kind of the core markets,” McCarthy said. “It's mathematically difficult for them to put up the same sort of growth numbers there. And so the question becomes, just how much growth will they be able to squeeze out of markets like serving bars?””"", ""Still, he praised the current management team for turning Vita Coca into a profitable, growing company with a strong balance sheet — enviable characteristics in today’s environment. “They've built a good business, so it’s kind of hard to bet against that.”"", 'While Vita Coca is thriving now, it has weathered its share of challenges.', 'In 2004, Vita Coco’s first shipment to the U.S. had to be diverted to the Bahamas after Kirban found he needed FDA approval for the products to enter the country. Then, in 2014, the company landed a deal to sell coconut oil in Whole Foods — “a massive opportunity” for Vita Coco, he recalled — but the deal for coconut oil was scrapped after product in the 12-ounce jars started oozing out the top.', 'Other disruptions at Vita Coco have been outside its control. In 2009, Coca-Cola took a stake in competitor Zico for $15 million before the beverage giant acquired the rest in 2013. Kirban said he was “in shock” after hearing Coca-Cola partnered with Zico, fearing the increased distribution would batter Vita Coco and tarnish the five years he toiled building his company.', 'Further challenges came in 2018 and early 2019 when, after years of rapid expansion, the coconut water category slowed as some consumers turned to trendier options such as hard seltzers, and retailers changed how they displayed offerings for the beverage. The slowdown only served to further embolden critics.', '“We continue to do the right things, chip away,” Kirban said. “There’s always mistakes to be made [and for us] to learn from our mistakes.”', 'Vita Coco has managed to withstand these disruptions and is arguably in the strongest position of its two-decade-long history.', 'The company, which went public in October 2021, is one of the top 10 best-performing IPOs and the second-best-performing consumer IPO since 2021, according to data provided by Vita Coco.', 'The coconut water segment has returned to growth. Category sales have surged 56% to nearly $680 million in grocery, club, mass, drug and convenience channels compared to 2019), Vita Coco noted, citing data from Circana. It is outperforming major beverage categories such as energy, carbonated soft drinks, sports drinks and bottled water in dollar growth rates. For its part, Vita Coco has been able to increase volume while simultaneously raising prices.', 'Net sales for coconut water at Vita Coco during the first nine months of the year have risen 15% to $387 million, with volume increasing 13%. It currently has a 51% share of the coconut water market — more if you include its private label business — compared to 42% in 2020, according to the company.', 'The company also managed to outlast its deeper-pocked competitors in the U.S.', 'ln 2021, Coca-Cola sold its Zico coconut water back to its founder as the beverage giant prioritized brands that were growing and had the potential to achieve a large scale. PepsiCo’s offering in the category, O.N.E., was divested in 2021 as part of the Tropicana sale.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This timberland owner and wood products company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -83.3%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $239.8 million, down 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

Specifically, the collection, transportation, and sorting of waste and recycling."", 'WM (NYSE: WM), formerly known as Waste Management, does it all and has a dominant position as the largest company in its industry. It hit a new intraday all-time high on Jan. 17 before closing at an all-time high on Jan. 18.', ""Granted, some waste management services are done by the public sector. So WM isn't solely competing with other companies. But WM continues to take market share, improve its fundamentals, and invest in growth opportunities."", ""Here's why WM deserves to be making an all-time high, and why the stock is worth buying now."", ""WM's business is fairly simple and easy to understand. The majority of revenue comes from the collection business, which is split into commercial, industrial, and residential. Although you may be most familiar with WM's residential business, it makes up just a quarter of collection revenue and 17% of total revenue. WM also makes money from its landfills, from transporting waste, and from recycling, although recycling makes up just 7% of revenue and is notoriously inconsistent."", 'However, WM has a plan to improve recycling. In its Q3 earnings release, it said it expects $240 million in EBITDA contributions from recycling beginning in 2026, as well as $500 million from renewable energy.', ""WM has been investing in turning landfill gas into usable, pipeline-quality gas. As organic matter decomposes, it produces methane, which is released into the atmosphere.

For that reason, WM is a recession-resistant business, which is unique because most industrial companies are cyclical."", ""Between 2005 and 2015, WM's earnings stagnated. But over the last eight years WM has found a new gear, doubling its earnings and boosting revenue by over 53%."", 'WM took a hit during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic as the services required by its commercial and industrial customers ground to a halt. Long-term contracts insulated WM from the full extent of that collapse. Since then, WM has done an impressive job growing its earnings and especially its revenue, which is at an all-time high.', 'WM generates a ton of free cash flow (FCF) which it has used to reinvest in the business, grow the dividend, and buy back stock. On Dec. 11, WM announced a 7.1% dividend increase, its 21st consecutive annual raise. It also got approval from its board to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its own stock.', ""Even with the raise, WM will only pay a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share -- good for a forward yield of just 1.6%, which isn't impressive. WM is a good example of a company with a low yield that's not due to a lack of raises, but because the dividend isn't the company's only focus -- and because the stock price has done so well."", 'Over the last ten years, WM stock has outperformed the S&P 500 and even the Nasdaq Composite, which is incredible for a stodgy industrial company.', ""What's more, WM's dividend has nearly doubled. And its outstanding share count is down 13.4% thanks to stock buybacks."", ""If WM had kept pace with the S&P 500's return over the last ten years, its dividend yield would have been more than double what it is today, or well over 3%, making WM a more viable passive income stream. But again, this isn't due to a lack of raises, but the stock's outperformance."", ""There's nothing not to like about WM as a business. The company is a dominant industry leader, is growing its top and bottom line, has exciting growth plans in recycling and RNG, makes a ton of cash flow, and uses that cash to raise the dividend and buy back stock."", ""The only downside of buying WM is the price tag. WM has a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.4 -- which may be surprising considering it's a moderate growth industrial. But WM has historically fetched a premium valuation, with a five-year median P/E of 30.3 and a 10-year median P/E of 28.2."", ""Investors continue to pay up for WM because of its rock-solid fundamentals and recession resilience. There's no reason that should change anytime soon.

Pyrolysis oil is a substitute for fossil-based materials used in polymer production. Typically, pyrolysis gas streams are consumed as a fuel, however, the MoReTec technology enables the pyrolysis gas to be recovered as well, contributing to the production of polymer and displacing fossil-based feedstocks, which reduces CO2 emissions."", 'The technology incorporates electrification of the core reaction process, making it possible for the unit to operate completely on renewable electricity. Scalable single train design along with low operating temperatures resulting from the use of catalysts and innovative heat transfer design are additional advantages of this differential technology.', 'These advantages enable the MoReTec technology to achieve high plastic to plastic conversion rates, helping increase the circularity of plastic waste.', ""The MoReTec demonstration plant in Germany will convert post-consumer plastic waste into feedstock for the production of new plastic materials to be offered under the company's CirculenRevive brand. CirculenRevive products offer solutions for a wide range of applications, including medical and food packaging. The MoReTec plant in Wesseling will have an annual processing capacity equivalent to the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by over 1.2 million German citizens per year. The MoReTec plant is planned to be started-up in 2026."", ""The Innovation Fund is one of the world's largest funding programs for the demonstration and commercialization of innovative low-carbon technologies. It is one of the key tools of the European Green Deal Industrial Plan and is financed by revenues from the auctioning of allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)."", 'About LyondellBasell', ""We are LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) - a leader in the global chemical industry creating solutions for everyday sustainable living.

We\'ll explore what this means in the ""Volume Growth"" section.', ""This quarter, Procter & Gamble's revenue grew 3.2% year on year to $21.44 billion, falling short of Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter."", 'The pandemic fundamentally changed several consumer habits. There is a founder-led company that is massively benefiting from this shift. The business has grown astonishingly fast, with 40%+ free cash flow margins. Its fundamentals are undoubtedly best-in-class. Still, the total addressable market is so big that the company has room to grow many times in size. You can find it on our platform for free.', 'Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful staples business as there’s a ceiling to what consumers will pay for everyday goods; they can always trade down to non-branded products if the branded versions are too expensive.', ""Procter & Gamble's average quarterly sales volumes have shrunk by 1.6% over the last two years. This decrease isn't ideal because the quantity demanded for consumer staples products is typically stable."", ""In Procter & Gamble's Q2 2024, year on year sales volumes were flat. This result was a well-appreciated turnaround from the 6% year-on-year decline it posted 12 months ago, showing the company is heading in the right direction."", 'Volume and organic growth missed, leading to a slight revenue miss. However, EPS beat and full year guidance was raised and now stands above Consensus expectations. Overall, this was a mixed quarter for Procter & Gamble. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $149.35 per share.', ""So should you invest in Procter & Gamble right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free."", 'One way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry and with revenue growth of 50% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.']"

These are essential for healthy and hygienic living.The aging of pipelines is concerning but water utilities continue with their upgrade and maintenance projects to minimize disruptions in operations. American Water Works Company AWK, with its widespread operations, provides services to domestic customers and military bases and offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one’s portfolio are California Water Service Group CWT, SJW Group SJW and Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO.', ' About the Industry', 'The Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial and residential customers, and military bases. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations. Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water to customers. The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges, but increasing efficient water use by individuals and other industries will ensure that previous water is not wasted. A large nation like the United States already has a widespread water infrastructure in place but proper maintenance and upgrade of aging infrastructure becomes crucial for the supply of potable water to millions of consumers.', ""3 Trends Pivotal for Shaping the Water Supply Industry's Future"", 'Fragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation:\xa0 Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. The industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on the efficient use of appliances and detecting leakage should help to prevent wastage.Aging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the ASCE, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. It is evident that this industry needs more investment for maintenance and upgrade. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The massive investment requirement also creates an opportunity for growth among operators in this space. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities. ASCE gives a C- rating to the U.S. drinking water infrastructure and D+ to the U.S. wastewater infrastructure.Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators. However, in its last three meetings in 2023, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate and indicated the possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 would be a positive for utility operators that are planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #53, which places it in the top 21% of more than 248 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish prospects for the near term.
