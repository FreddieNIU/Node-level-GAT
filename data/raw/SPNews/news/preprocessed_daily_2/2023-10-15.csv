But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) share price managed to fall 64% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 13% in the last three months.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for Under Armour To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Under Armour moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 2.6% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnder Armour is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Under Armour stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 21% in the last year, Under Armour shareholders lost 5.2%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, longer term shareholders are suffering worse, given the loss of 10% doled out over the last five years. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

4,fa85260c-7b45-374b-8412-7482c0ca530c,O,2023-10-15,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-055718502.html,1697349438,STORY,"['CL=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com - Two factors will determine the direction of oil markets in the coming week. The first is how much the conflict in the Middle East could escalate and what it might mean for supplies in the world's top oil producing region. The second is what will the weekly update on US crude stockpiles look like on Wednesday.Crude prices got to finish the just-ended week up as much as 7%, after somewhat of a roller-coaster. An initial 4% gain on Monday from concerns over the latest Middle East war was pared to just 1% by Thursday from data showing the worst weekly US crude build in eight months, on top of record production.By Friday, though, it looked like oil had entered a whole new world as the United States exercised its first sanctions against the flouters of the G-7 price cap on Russian oil. As the week drew to a close and crude prices tacked on almost 6% more, the Biden administration had not announced if it will come down hard on Iranian oil next.There were rumblings though from all fronts, pushing it to act.One of the chief instigators was Iran itself, which continued to demonstrate the bellicose nature of its relationship with Hamas. State-organized rallies were held across the Islamic Republic Friday in support of the Palestinian terror group, simultaneous with condemnations of the Israeli bombardment of the blockaded Gaza Strip.In the US Congress, Republicans were just as boisterous. Kevin McCarthy of California said the United States should “stop Iran from being able to produce the oil”. Lindsey Graham of South California said if the conflict escalates, “we should tell the Ayatollah we will destroy your oil refineries and your oil infrastructure.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did say nothing was ‘off the table’ as the United States considers new sanctions on Iran and Hamas.The truth is that’s easier said than done.The crisis in Israel actually poses a new challenge for the world economy and the Biden administration, which has spent the last year working to combat inflation in the United States and to corral energy prices that have become volatile because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Another war in the Middle East complicates those efforts by threatening to constrain oil supplies and send prices higher.Story continuesWhile “Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks for having supported Hamas going back decades,” there’s currently “no evidence of direct support” for this specific attack, said US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer.The White House moved instead to close loopholes in its sanctions enforcement on Russia with sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the G7's cap of $60 a barrel.With Tehran, though, no one could tell what the Biden administration would do.Since late 2022, Washington has virtually turned a blind eye to surging Iranian oil exports that bypassed US sanctions as it allowed an informal détente with Tehran to get more of the Islamic Republic’s oil onto the world market to offset OPEC+ production cuts. As a result, Iranian crude output is estimated to have surged nearly 700,000 barrels a day this year – the second-largest source of incremental supply in 2023, behind only US shale oil.Even if the White House advocates a tougher approach on Iranian sanctions, ultimately the amount of oil snagged from the mullahs at midsea might be nominal.In fact, the administration will likely be more effective in denying Iran some of the cold cash it needs from oil.Democratic Senator Cory Booker said $6 billion in Iranian oil assets freed up as part of last month's U.S.-Iran prisoner swap has been re-frozen. The money was meant to be used for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.So, money, more than oil, might be at stake on any redoubling of US sanctions’ efforts on Iran.On the oil inventory front, US crude stocks could see another build in the coming week amid the refinery maintenance season - unless exports, which tumbled the previous week, come back with a huge spike.In its latest data roundup for the week ended Oct. 6, the US Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said the crude inventory balance climbed by 10.176 million barrels, the most since a weekly rise of 16.283M in mid-February.Crude stocks ballooned last week as exports, often a juggernaut in the weekly EIA report, fell almost 2 million barrels to reach 3.067M per day versus the 4.956M per day level during the week to Sept. 29.Crude exports hit a record high just shy of 4 million barrels per day in the first half of the year, the EIA said in a separate report on Wednesday.Processing of crude oil into fuel and other products also dropped last week, by almost 2%, to 85.7% as refineries went into maintenance.More riveting than that was the EIA’s estimate on crude production. The agency gave that as 13.2M barrels per day - up 300,000 from the prior week. It was the highest ever government estimate on crude production, which prior to this had not exceeded the 13.1M peak reached just before the March 2020 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that decimated crude demand.The EIA has been estimating higher crude production for the United States in recent months, citing higher efficiency in output from US shale oil basins despite a sheer cutback in the number of oil rigs actively deployed by drillers.“It’s staggering how far US oil production has come in just a few months this year to reach this record high cited by the EIA,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded WTI, crude for delivery in November did a final trade of $86.35 on Friday after officially settling the session at $87.69, up $4.78, or 5.8%. The US crude benchmark hit a session high of $87.83 versus the week’s low of $82.78.London-traded Brent crude for the most-active December contract did a final trade of $90.80 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $90.89. The global crude benchmark hit a session high of $91 versus the week’s low of $85.18.Oil: WTI Technical Price OutlookThe runaway gap for US crude left at $82.80 has been filled with the retracement to $82.30 and fresh to reach $87.80, noted Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Going further, immediate resistance in WTI is seen at the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $88.10 followed by $88.30,” he said.“Clearing through $88.30 will put $90.80 into focus as the next immediate challenge. If this zone is accepted by market, expect a smooth rally that aims to retest $96.50.”On the lower end, stability above the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $86.20 may be considered as active support, Dixit said.“A sustained break below $86.60-$86.20 will be the first indication of sellers gaining confidence looking for a drop to $83 again.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity From near the jaws of $1,700 an ounce, gold bulls are back to $1,900 safety, after the Middle East’s latest crisis led to a huge leap Friday that topped a week of incredible price swings in the yellow metal.Gold’s most-active futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,945.90 per ounce on Friday after officially settling the session at $1,941.50, up $58.50, or 3.1%, on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures showed a gain of 5%, its most in a week since March.The spot price of gold, more closely watched by some traders than futures, settled at $1,932.82, up $63.95 or 3.4%. Last Friday, the spot price, which reflects real-time trades in bullion, hit an intraday low of $1,810.10 — less than $10 above $1,700 territory.Friday’s move up was the biggest in a day for spot gold since March 17. The rounded-up weekly gain of 5% in the current week was also the largest since March.Gold’s latest jump came after the Israeli government late on Thursday warned more than 1 million people in Northern Gaza to evacuate the area as its war with Hamas escalated. Talk was also growing that Israel was preparing for a major land assault on Gaza.“Growing chaos in the Middle Easter continues to fuel safe-haven demand for gold as a 2% rally into the weekend also puts pressure on bears in the marketplace,” Neils Christensen wrote on kitco.com, the website of the bullion trading band of the same name.More startling, the gold rally came as the US Dollar Index, or DXY, ticked up for a second day in a row, resuming the greenback’s run-up over the last three months, which was interrupted only by last week’s slide. Gold typically moves in the opposite direction to the dollar.Gold: Spot Price Technical Outlook The next immediate resistance for spot gold is seen at the descending trendline point of interest at $1,938 and $1,942, said Dixit of SKCharting.com.“A continuation above $1,942 will open the door to the previous month high of $1,953, which is the acceleration point for the next bull run into a new record high, after retesting $2,080.”He also noted that the 4-hour chart on spot gold showed overbought conditions calling for a softening of its momentum, with chances of a pullback towards the breakout zone seen at the 200-day SMA of $1,929 and the 100-day SMA of $1,923.“If selling pushes the metal below $1,923, expect a further decline to the 50 Day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $1,897, followed by the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $1,878.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The most-active November gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.208 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday, after officially settling the session at $3.2360, down 10.8 cents, or 3.2%, on the day. For the week, November gas also fell 2%, versus the prior week’s advance of 14%.Gas price fell despite the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reporting a build of just 84 billion cubic feet, or bcf, in storage of the fuel during the week ended Oct. 6, versus the 88 bcf build expected by industry analysts tracked by Investing.com. In the prior week to Sept. 29, storage rose by 86 bcf.Total gas in US storage was at 3.529 trillion cubic feet as of last week, up 9.8% from a year ago, the EIA said. Earlier this year, the storage was more than 20% up year-on-year. On a five-year basis (2018-2022), inventories were just 4.8% higher, down from double-digits earlier this year.Natural gas: Price OutlookStability below the $3.47-$3.37 level will keep prices in a consolidation mode, looking to retest the support zone of $3.14, followed by the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.97, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“If this zone fails to hold as support, look for a further drop to the 50-day EMA of $2.84 and the 100-day SMA of $2.66.”Resumption of the bullish trend will require gas to reclaim momentum above the 50-week EMA of $3.35 and receive firm acceptance as well above the swing high of $3.47, said Dixit.“The next major resistance sits at the 200-week SMA of $3.77, followed by the 50-month EMA of $3.84.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil surges nearly 6% after Israel begins ground raids into GazaBrazil shipping agents warn clients drought disrupting corn shipping on barges]"
5,22c58ec7-7ab8-3345-9a0d-7554eb6d7d07,O,2023-10-15,All Eyes On Iran For Security Of Oil Supply,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eyes-iran-security-oil-supply-230000515.html,1697324400,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Iran has become the focus of international attention in the wake of Hamas attacks on Israel that prompted large-scale retaliation as the make-or-break actor in what increasingly looks like a new war in the Middle East.While any war in the Middle East is a potential threat to oil supply security, one involving a producer the size of Iran could have even deeper implications for global oil markets. None of these implications are positive.Soon after the news of the attacks broke, there were reports claiming Iran, a supporter of Hamas, was involved in their planning. The information was denied by Tehran, while Israel and its biggest ally, the United States, said there was no evidence of Iran's involvement. Yet this did not stop U.S. Senator and vocal war hawk Lindsay Graham from calling on the U.S. to bomb Iranian refineries.That and similar calls from presidential hopeful Nikki Haley are essentially calls for an escalation of the conflict beyond sanctions, which many analysts see as the most likely course of action that Washington would follow. Such an escalation would quite probably send oil prices above $100 per barrel.Yet there is also another potential scenario where Iran is the actor taking a bigger role in the conflict.""The main thing to watch for is whether Iran becomes actively involved in the conflict and the reason why is because of Iran's proximity to the really crucial waterway called the Strait of Hormuz,"" Rapidan Energy Group's global oil service director Clay Siegle told Bloomberg this week.Related: U.S. Oil Rigs Decrease for Second Week Running, Gas Rigs RiseIndeed, the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian waters, is one of the biggest oil chokepoints in the world. The amount of oil that passes through the strait daily is around 17 million barrels of oil, which is equal to about 17% of global oil demand as forecast for this year. It is also equal to close to 90% of Middle Eastern oil that leaves the region via the Persian Gulf.Story continuesThe importance of the Strait of Hormuz occasionally makes headlines when Iran threatens to close it, which it does when tensions flare up between Tehran and the West. To say that tensions are currently flaring up would be an understatement, which makes the situation fraught with danger.The danger would spike—and so would prices—if we get to a point where Iran wants to close the Strait of Hormuz and the United States wants to keep it open. That would amount to a direct confrontation between the two that could not end well. For now, however, such a prospect seems remote.This is perhaps why prices have not really rallied after the Hamas attacks and Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza. Indeed, initially the benchmarks jumped but quickly retreated when the American Petroleum Institute reported a massive oil inventory build and the EIA confirmed it.Still, the potential for supply disruption remains significant. Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said this week that ""other fronts"" might open in the war, suggesting escalation is very definitely an option.At the same time, Iran's President talked with the Saudi Crown Prince as Saudi Arabia has taken the role of moderator, seeking to de-escalate the situation. Per an FT report on the conversation, Ebrahim Raisi said that both Iran and Saudi Arabia ""should defend the Muslim and oppressed nation of Palestine at this critical time.""Saudi Arabia, which has been recently working on a deal to build diplomatic relations with Israel, has refrained from taking a side. The U.S., however, just stopped the transfer of $6 billion to Iran as part of a prisoner swap deal, and that would quite likely make Tehran angry.""The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians,"" the Iranian mission to the UN said, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.That might be the first step of a potential escalation, especially if the hawks in Congress take the upper hand. Even the International Energy Agency has made a statement regarding the conflict and its potential impact on oil markets.""While there has been no direct impact on physical supply, markets will remain on tenterhooks as the crisis unfolds,"" the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report for October. The agency added it stood ready to act in case of a market disruption. The nature of the action remained undisclosed.Last year, the IEA, together with the U.S. released a massive amount of oil from inventories to arrest the oil price surge. As a result, the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve fell to the lowest in 40 years, equal to about 17 days of consumption, which makes a repeat of last year's release unlikely.An Iranian involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas would have a major effect on global oil supply security. Perhaps it is awareness of this fact that has motivated the diplomatic rush to an end to the fighting before it escalates.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rystad Energy Sees Oil Prices Falling To $60 In 2027 As Demand PeaksCan Oil Prices Remain Below $90?Shell Anticipates Gas Trading Surge In Q4Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

I need natural gas, ready, cheap and available as a feedstock.”Mr Gardner delivered his warning about the site’s future directly to Labour’s leaders last week, leading a delegation of Ineos executives at the party’s annual conference in Liverpool. He has also met with Sir Keir.Grangemouth, which is part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos empire, is Scotland’s only remaining crude oil refinery, producing most of the petrol, diesel, heating oil and aviation fuel used in Scotland and other markets in northern England and Northern Ireland.It also supplies raw materials to the adjacent petrochemical and plastics plant run by Ineos Olefins and Polymers whose raw plastics and polymers go into UK products ranging from construction materials to clothing.Grangemouth relies on oil and gas from the North Sea for energy and raw materials and is fed by a direct pipeline linking it to 80 of the UK’s offshore oil and gas fields.Most of those fields are in decline but would normally be replaced by new wells. However, Labour plans to ban such new drilling if it wins power.Grangemouth, Scotland’s only remaining crude oil refinery, employs more than 2,000 workers - David Cheskin/PAThe Grangemouth plant, run by Petroineos, employs more than 2,000 workers and Mr Gardner’s warning prompted union chiefs to warn that North Sea workers risked becoming “the coal miners of our generation”.Ineos hopes to build a plant at Grangemouth that will turn natural gas into hydrogen, powering the entire complex with minimal emissions and preserving jobs and manufacturing. However, the scheme relies on having long-term supplies of natural gas.Story continuesMr Gardner said: “Our passion is to keep manufacturing in the UK and Europe. This is a critical time because parts of society want to outsource manufacturing, outsource jobs and import carbon.“And what I say is no, the best way is to absolutely turn that on its head. We want to stay in the UK and Europe, and we want to decarbonize in the UK, while keeping the manufacturing and jobs here.”A Labour spokesman declined to answer Gardner’s specific points but said: “Labour has committed to delivering industrial decarbonisation in Grangemouth, with a plan to invest £1bn across the country in protecting thousands of jobs in heavy industry as well as creating many more in CCS and hydrogen.”The warning from Mr Gardner risks inflaming tensions between Labour and its union backers.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite does not support the policy to stop all exploration licences in the North Sea. I have personally spoken to Keir Starmer on this issue and it remains key to our conversations with Labour. “We cannot allow oil and gas workers to become the coal miners of our generation. The Grangemouth site is of critical importance to the UK’s energy infrastructure and supply.”A government source said: “This is an example of how Labour’s reckless short term approach would sacrifice hundreds of thousands of British jobs, lead to higher emissions and endanger Britain’s energy security.”David Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, the offshore industry’s trade body, said politicians needed to build a better understanding of the UK energy industry before issuing policy pronouncements.He said: “The oil and gas industry supports over 200,000 UK jobs, and over 90,000 of those are in Scotland. These are the same people with the skills needed to engineer a sustainable future. Companies like Ineos are developing the solutions we will need to reach net zero.”UK oil production hit an all-time low of 38m tonnes in 2022. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) predicts that without new wells it will plummet further to 22m tonnes by 2030.The NSTA’s annual Wells report shows the number of operating wells fell to 1,629 last year, compared with 2,052 in 2019. Another 900 have been mothballed.Gas production has fallen from its 2002 peak of 109 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 38bcm last year.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.As the stock market undergoes rollercoaster swings amid flurry of new data, analysts are still surprised by the outperformance of mega-cap stocks in the tech industry. The now famous “magnificent seven” group of tech stocks account for a major chunk of stock market gains this year. Many analysts believe these gains are expected to continue as the AI boom is just getting started. In the coming days there will be new product launches and AI announcements, while analysts are also expecting strong days ahead for e-commerce and tech stocks like Meta and Amazon amid the shopping season.Scott Chronert, Citi U.S. equity strategist, while talking to CNBC, recently said that he upgraded tech stocks after he saw valuations reset to attractive levels. The analyst said that over the past couple of months tech stocks had a pullback which made the companies in the sector investable again. Chronert said that if investors are looking to offset the effects of rising rates, tech stocks is the way to go.Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 12 mega-cap stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Big Company Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Big Company Stocks to Buy12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks 12th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 114 hedge funds reported having stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during this period was Boykin Curry’s  Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mulling a price hike after the end of the Hollywood strike.Story continuesPolen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks 11th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 121 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). The biggest stakeholder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $214 million stake in the company.Taiwan Economic Daily recently reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has increased its orders for advanced packaging to fulfill orders of processors that are especially made for artificial intelligenceArtisan Focus Fund made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Accelerated card sales are expected to grow from $5.2B to ~$50B in 2026. Just last year this $50B was expected to be $15B-$17B, signifying the massive inflection at hand. We believe this step function in demand almost entirely accrues to Nvidia, one of our winners in Q1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently does not have an AI-specific accelerated card but should be in the market by the end of the year, making it also compelling. Regardless, Nvidia’s software is the only game in town, and we believe it will ultimately be layered on top of AMD or any other cards that come up. We are early in this process and believe we have sized this market more accurately than other research providers, giving us an advantage in executing and generating alpha in this area over the coming years. Downstream, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is also an important holding for us and one of only three companies that is currently able to manufacture these accelerated cards at scale. Among the three, Taiwan Semiconductor is the most advanced. As seen below, the mix shift in compute spending in the accelerated format represents a massive TAM shift.”10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is seen as a potential AI play as the company released several AI features for its CRM platform earlier this year.Investment firm Baird recently said Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s Dreamforce conference was a positive for the company as it had a huge focus on AI.A total of 122 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.1 billion stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”9. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is showing massive insider selling activity, including selling from CEO Tim Cook. However, the latest weakness in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be the perfect entry point for long-term investors. Bank of America recently highlighted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s app store revenue in the third quarter jumped about 8.6% year over year.  Evercore ISI recently said in a report that the demand for iPhone 15 Pro remains strong everywhere except China and Japan.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The most significant stakeholder of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $178 billion stake in the company.Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ranks 8th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its latest earnings call talked about travel spending patterns and its guidance:“Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the top big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been ruthlessly cutting costs in a bid to focus on profits and controlled growth. Those efforts are showing results. For the first time in history, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted an operating profit earlier this year when it posted results for the second quarter of 2023.  Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s net income in the period came in at $394 million, up $1.0 billion on a year-over-year basis.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 144 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s CEO talked about Uber’s future plans, using of AI and machine learning and cost discipline in Q2 earnings call:""Travel is a very important ecosystem for us, both in terms of pickups and drop-offs, and we have a very significant audience of international travelers and U.K. travelers. And we said, “Hey, why can’t we go after this tour operator market?” And essentially, we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators with what I will call the Uber Delight. We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we’re a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I’m going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there.And what we’re seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time. So, when we know it’s your morning commute on a Tuesday morning, we don’t offer you the Eurostar, but when we think that you might be open to new and different ways of using the Uber, and we want to be your kind of the operating system for everyday life, not just for you to go to work, but to be that travel companion as well, we will extend those services, offer those services. We’ve now expanded into flights as well. And we’re actually seeing engagement with users being higher than we thought, and we’re not seeing cannibalization of the base business. So, we’re quite hopeful of that business. And again, that tour operator market in the U.K. is a very, very large market that we can go after.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor for the quarter following better than expected 1Q23 earnings and 2Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $31.4 billion were up 22% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $15 billion grew 44% over the last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”6.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Stocks With Huge Catalysts on the Way.The US stock market continues to be in a see-saw mode as investors gauge and digest latest data. The latest jobs report shows that the labor market continues to be strong, adding to the possibility of further rate hikes. In a September market update report, JPMorgan had said that the next few reports might show that inflation pressures are returning and that would be the test of investors’ nerves. Amid strong consumer spending and tight labor market, analysts believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and the central bank is more than ready to continue raising interest rates. Major stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are moving based on these events.While the debate around the possibility of further rate hikes and stickiness of inflation is never ending, one thing is for sure: long-term investors take any sell-off in the current environment as a buying opportunity. Jim Cramer last month said that it does not make any sense to sell stocks just because the Federal Reserve is not providing enough clarity around its future plans. These are uncertain times and asking for total certainty and clarity is unrealistic. Cramer said that investors should buy stocks that do well during inflation and sell them once inflation begins to cool down. Cramer said that rising interest rates was one of the reasons why investors were selling stocks. However, he believes real investing means you buy stocks for long-term gains instead of relying on short-term news cycles. Cramer said:“The Fed can’t upend the rally because there isn’t a rally. Higher rates won’t send stocks lower because they’re already down. That’s how you have to think about things like the stock market. Otherwise, you know what? There really isn’t a level where it feels safe to own stocks other than at the top, when nobody’s worried about anything. That’s not investing, though. That’s called stupidity.”Story continuesWhile most of the analysts talk about the possibility of rate cuts and cooling inflation in 2024, there’s another angle to this story that has started to become a topic of discussion lately. Some analysts are starting to believe that we are entering a new era where interest rates and inflation are expected to stay at elevated levels for several years to come. There’s no way around it, according to them. In March 2023, T. Rowe Price said in a report that the biggest reason why value made a huge comeback against growth in 2022 was the reality check investors had after a long period of time. When credit was cheap and inflation low, technology companies enjoyed huge gains. But the post-pandemic era and its realities started to give rise to inflation and the world of today is starkly different from the past. The report said that inflation and interest rates could stay at elevated levels for a long time, which could bode well for value stocks as investors flock to realistic valuations.The T. Rowe Price report also said that in the next decade many dominant companies of today could be on a decline amid competition. The report said that several years from now people would still be using digital services and driving electric cars but there would be a lot of new players in digital services and companies dominating the futuristic technology markets today might not be very exciting investments 10 years from now. The report gives example of Volkswagen, which it believes is cheap when it comes to valuation. What if Volkswagen begins to produce EVs of standard at par with Tesla in the future? Given Volkswagen's huge size and dominance in traditional car markets, the stock could become more attractive than Tesla in the future because big size gives advantage to survive and thrive when competition is high.But not everyone is optimistic in the short term. JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic believes chances of markets avoiding a recession are thin. Talking to CNBC, the analyst said that in the short term stocks could still have upside but a few months from now the S&amp;P 500 has downside.“Could there be another five, six, seven percent upside in equities? Of course... But there’s a downside. It could be 20% downside,” Kolanovic said.The analyst warned that the “magnificent seven” companies that have seen huge gains during 2023 are expected to see declines soon. These companies include tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. Most of the stock market gains this year came from these mega-cap tech stocks. Several analysts have been consistently warning about the concentration of stock market gains problem. Most of the gains in the stock market this year came due to the AI boom which had investors jumping on the bandwagon of AI. But Kolanovic believes these companies could soon start to see declines. He’s also worried about the state of the consumer in the US, who is increasingly getting crushed by inflation and rate hikes.“The job market is still strong. But you are starting to see the stress in [the] consumer if you look at sort of the delinquencies in the [credit] cards and auto loans. We remain somewhat negative still,” Kolanovic said.Stocks With Huge Catalysts on the Waysource: pixabayOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured several analyst reports and investing platforms to list down stocks that are expected to move on upcoming catalysts, events, and news.

During the second quarter, Chipotle grew same-store sales by 7.4%, or 40% from 2019 levels. Transactions grew 4.4%, a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter, and price increases from 2022 contributed 5.5% offset somewhat by a shift from group to individual orders which was a 2.5% headwind. The negative group to individual impact should shrink in the balance of the year and cease to be a headwind as we enter 2024.Chipotle’s ongoing traffic momentum is fueled by improving in-restaurant execution and its continued cadence of successful menu innovation. The current limited time offering, chicken al pastor, is ordered in one out of every five transactions. Management plans to launch a new limited time offering later in the third quarter. Unlike most competitors, Chipotle has not yet taken pricing in 2023, thereby further improving its industry-leading value proposition. Management did, however, signal its openness to increasing menu prices later this year if cost inflation persists…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.As the stock market undergoes rollercoaster swings amid flurry of new data, analysts are still surprised by the outperformance of mega-cap stocks in the tech industry. The now famous “magnificent seven” group of tech stocks account for a major chunk of stock market gains this year. Many analysts believe these gains are expected to continue as the AI boom is just getting started. In the coming days there will be new product launches and AI announcements, while analysts are also expecting strong days ahead for e-commerce and tech stocks like Meta and Amazon amid the shopping season.Scott Chronert, Citi U.S. equity strategist, while talking to CNBC, recently said that he upgraded tech stocks after he saw valuations reset to attractive levels. The analyst said that over the past couple of months tech stocks had a pullback which made the companies in the sector investable again. Chronert said that if investors are looking to offset the effects of rising rates, tech stocks is the way to go.Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 12 mega-cap stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Big Company Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Big Company Stocks to Buy12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks 12th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 114 hedge funds reported having stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during this period was Boykin Curry’s  Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mulling a price hike after the end of the Hollywood strike.Story continuesPolen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks 11th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 121 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). The biggest stakeholder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $214 million stake in the company.Taiwan Economic Daily recently reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has increased its orders for advanced packaging to fulfill orders of processors that are especially made for artificial intelligenceArtisan Focus Fund made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Accelerated card sales are expected to grow from $5.2B to ~$50B in 2026. Just last year this $50B was expected to be $15B-$17B, signifying the massive inflection at hand. We believe this step function in demand almost entirely accrues to Nvidia, one of our winners in Q1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently does not have an AI-specific accelerated card but should be in the market by the end of the year, making it also compelling. Regardless, Nvidia’s software is the only game in town, and we believe it will ultimately be layered on top of AMD or any other cards that come up. We are early in this process and believe we have sized this market more accurately than other research providers, giving us an advantage in executing and generating alpha in this area over the coming years. Downstream, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is also an important holding for us and one of only three companies that is currently able to manufacture these accelerated cards at scale. Among the three, Taiwan Semiconductor is the most advanced. As seen below, the mix shift in compute spending in the accelerated format represents a massive TAM shift.”10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is seen as a potential AI play as the company released several AI features for its CRM platform earlier this year.Investment firm Baird recently said Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s Dreamforce conference was a positive for the company as it had a huge focus on AI.A total of 122 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”9. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is showing massive insider selling activity, including selling from CEO Tim Cook. However, the latest weakness in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be the perfect entry point for long-term investors. Bank of America recently highlighted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s app store revenue in the third quarter jumped about 8.6% year over year.  Evercore ISI recently said in a report that the demand for iPhone 15 Pro remains strong everywhere except China and Japan.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ranks 8th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently said the report from the Wall Street Journal saying the company is mulling to hike credit card fees is wrong.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 139 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The most significant stakeholder of MA during this period was Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management which owns a $2.31 billion stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is enjoying massive consumer spending on travel. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its latest earnings call talked about travel spending patterns and its guidance:“Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the top big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been ruthlessly cutting costs in a bid to focus on profits and controlled growth. Those efforts are showing results. For the first time in history, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted an operating profit earlier this year when it posted results for the second quarter of 2023.  Uber Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:UBER).Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s CEO talked about Uber’s future plans, using of AI and machine learning and cost discipline in Q2 earnings call:""Travel is a very important ecosystem for us, both in terms of pickups and drop-offs, and we have a very significant audience of international travelers and U.K. travelers. And we said, “Hey, why can’t we go after this tour operator market?” And essentially, we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators with what I will call the Uber Delight. We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we’re a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I’m going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there.And what we’re seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time. So, when we know it’s your morning commute on a Tuesday morning, we don’t offer you the Eurostar, but when we think that you might be open to new and different ways of using the Uber, and we want to be your kind of the operating system for everyday life, not just for you to go to work, but to be that travel companion as well, we will extend those services, offer those services.

(NYSE:UBER) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor for the quarter following better than expected 1Q23 earnings and 2Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $31.4 billion were up 22% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $15 billion grew 44% over the last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”6.

22,fa85260c-7b45-374b-8412-7482c0ca530c,NOV,2023-10-15,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-055718502.html,1697349438,STORY,"['CL=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com - Two factors will determine the direction of oil markets in the coming week. The first is how much the conflict in the Middle East could escalate and what it might mean for supplies in the world's top oil producing region. The second is what will the weekly update on US crude stockpiles look like on Wednesday.Crude prices got to finish the just-ended week up as much as 7%, after somewhat of a roller-coaster. An initial 4% gain on Monday from concerns over the latest Middle East war was pared to just 1% by Thursday from data showing the worst weekly US crude build in eight months, on top of record production.By Friday, though, it looked like oil had entered a whole new world as the United States exercised its first sanctions against the flouters of the G-7 price cap on Russian oil. As the week drew to a close and crude prices tacked on almost 6% more, the Biden administration had not announced if it will come down hard on Iranian oil next.There were rumblings though from all fronts, pushing it to act.One of the chief instigators was Iran itself, which continued to demonstrate the bellicose nature of its relationship with Hamas. State-organized rallies were held across the Islamic Republic Friday in support of the Palestinian terror group, simultaneous with condemnations of the Israeli bombardment of the blockaded Gaza Strip.In the US Congress, Republicans were just as boisterous. Kevin McCarthy of California said the United States should “stop Iran from being able to produce the oil”. Lindsey Graham of South California said if the conflict escalates, “we should tell the Ayatollah we will destroy your oil refineries and your oil infrastructure.”Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did say nothing was ‘off the table’ as the United States considers new sanctions on Iran and Hamas.The truth is that’s easier said than done.The crisis in Israel actually poses a new challenge for the world economy and the Biden administration, which has spent the last year working to combat inflation in the United States and to corral energy prices that have become volatile because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Another war in the Middle East complicates those efforts by threatening to constrain oil supplies and send prices higher.Story continuesWhile “Iran is broadly complicit in these attacks for having supported Hamas going back decades,” there’s currently “no evidence of direct support” for this specific attack, said US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer.The White House moved instead to close loopholes in its sanctions enforcement on Russia with sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the G7's cap of $60 a barrel.With Tehran, though, no one could tell what the Biden administration would do.Since late 2022, Washington has virtually turned a blind eye to surging Iranian oil exports that bypassed US sanctions as it allowed an informal détente with Tehran to get more of the Islamic Republic’s oil onto the world market to offset OPEC+ production cuts. As a result, Iranian crude output is estimated to have surged nearly 700,000 barrels a day this year – the second-largest source of incremental supply in 2023, behind only US shale oil.Even if the White House advocates a tougher approach on Iranian sanctions, ultimately the amount of oil snagged from the mullahs at midsea might be nominal.In fact, the administration will likely be more effective in denying Iran some of the cold cash it needs from oil.Democratic Senator Cory Booker said $6 billion in Iranian oil assets freed up as part of last month's U.S.-Iran prisoner swap has been re-frozen. The money was meant to be used for food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.So, money, more than oil, might be at stake on any redoubling of US sanctions’ efforts on Iran.On the oil inventory front, US crude stocks could see another build in the coming week amid the refinery maintenance season - unless exports, which tumbled the previous week, come back with a huge spike.In its latest data roundup for the week ended Oct. 6, the US Energy Information Administration, or EIA, said the crude inventory balance climbed by 10.176 million barrels, the most since a weekly rise of 16.283M in mid-February.Crude stocks ballooned last week as exports, often a juggernaut in the weekly EIA report, fell almost 2 million barrels to reach 3.067M per day versus the 4.956M per day level during the week to Sept. 29.Crude exports hit a record high just shy of 4 million barrels per day in the first half of the year, the EIA said in a separate report on Wednesday.Processing of crude oil into fuel and other products also dropped last week, by almost 2%, to 85.7% as refineries went into maintenance.More riveting than that was the EIA’s estimate on crude production. The agency gave that as 13.2M barrels per day - up 300,000 from the prior week. It was the highest ever government estimate on crude production, which prior to this had not exceeded the 13.1M peak reached just before the March 2020 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic that decimated crude demand.The EIA has been estimating higher crude production for the United States in recent months, citing higher efficiency in output from US shale oil basins despite a sheer cutback in the number of oil rigs actively deployed by drillers.“It’s staggering how far US oil production has come in just a few months this year to reach this record high cited by the EIA,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded WTI, crude for delivery in November did a final trade of $86.35 on Friday after officially settling the session at $87.69, up $4.78, or 5.8%. The US crude benchmark hit a session high of $87.83 versus the week’s low of $82.78.London-traded Brent crude for the most-active December contract did a final trade of $90.80 on Friday, after officially settling the session at $90.89. The global crude benchmark hit a session high of $91 versus the week’s low of $85.18.Oil: WTI Technical Price OutlookThe runaway gap for US crude left at $82.80 has been filled with the retracement to $82.30 and fresh to reach $87.80, noted Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Going further, immediate resistance in WTI is seen at the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $88.10 followed by $88.30,” he said.“Clearing through $88.30 will put $90.80 into focus as the next immediate challenge. If this zone is accepted by market, expect a smooth rally that aims to retest $96.50.”On the lower end, stability above the 100-week SMA, or Simple Moving Average, of $86.20 may be considered as active support, Dixit said.“A sustained break below $86.60-$86.20 will be the first indication of sellers gaining confidence looking for a drop to $83 again.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity From near the jaws of $1,700 an ounce, gold bulls are back to $1,900 safety, after the Middle East’s latest crisis led to a huge leap Friday that topped a week of incredible price swings in the yellow metal.Gold’s most-active futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,945.90 per ounce on Friday after officially settling the session at $1,941.50, up $58.50, or 3.1%, on the day. For the week, the benchmark gold futures showed a gain of 5%, its most in a week since March.The spot price of gold, more closely watched by some traders than futures, settled at $1,932.82, up $63.95 or 3.4%. Last Friday, the spot price, which reflects real-time trades in bullion, hit an intraday low of $1,810.10 — less than $10 above $1,700 territory.Friday’s move up was the biggest in a day for spot gold since March 17. The rounded-up weekly gain of 5% in the current week was also the largest since March.Gold’s latest jump came after the Israeli government late on Thursday warned more than 1 million people in Northern Gaza to evacuate the area as its war with Hamas escalated. Talk was also growing that Israel was preparing for a major land assault on Gaza.“Growing chaos in the Middle Easter continues to fuel safe-haven demand for gold as a 2% rally into the weekend also puts pressure on bears in the marketplace,” Neils Christensen wrote on kitco.com, the website of the bullion trading band of the same name.More startling, the gold rally came as the US Dollar Index, or DXY, ticked up for a second day in a row, resuming the greenback’s run-up over the last three months, which was interrupted only by last week’s slide. Gold typically moves in the opposite direction to the dollar.Gold: Spot Price Technical Outlook The next immediate resistance for spot gold is seen at the descending trendline point of interest at $1,938 and $1,942, said Dixit of SKCharting.com.“A continuation above $1,942 will open the door to the previous month high of $1,953, which is the acceleration point for the next bull run into a new record high, after retesting $2,080.”He also noted that the 4-hour chart on spot gold showed overbought conditions calling for a softening of its momentum, with chances of a pullback towards the breakout zone seen at the 200-day SMA of $1,929 and the 100-day SMA of $1,923.“If selling pushes the metal below $1,923, expect a further decline to the 50 Day EMA, or Exponential Moving Average, of $1,897, followed by the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $1,878.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity The most-active November gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub did a final trade of $3.208 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units on Friday, after officially settling the session at $3.2360, down 10.8 cents, or 3.2%, on the day. For the week, November gas also fell 2%, versus the prior week’s advance of 14%.Gas price fell despite the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reporting a build of just 84 billion cubic feet, or bcf, in storage of the fuel during the week ended Oct. 6, versus the 88 bcf build expected by industry analysts tracked by Investing.com. In the prior week to Sept. 29, storage rose by 86 bcf.Total gas in US storage was at 3.529 trillion cubic feet as of last week, up 9.8% from a year ago, the EIA said. Earlier this year, the storage was more than 20% up year-on-year. On a five-year basis (2018-2022), inventories were just 4.8% higher, down from double-digits earlier this year.Natural gas: Price OutlookStability below the $3.47-$3.37 level will keep prices in a consolidation mode, looking to retest the support zone of $3.14, followed by the Daily Middle Bollinger Band of $2.97, said SKCharting’s Dixit.“If this zone fails to hold as support, look for a further drop to the 50-day EMA of $2.84 and the 100-day SMA of $2.66.”Resumption of the bullish trend will require gas to reclaim momentum above the 50-week EMA of $3.35 and receive firm acceptance as well above the swing high of $3.47, said Dixit.“The next major resistance sits at the 200-week SMA of $3.77, followed by the 50-month EMA of $3.84.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil surges nearly 6% after Israel begins ground raids into GazaBrazil shipping agents warn clients drought disrupting corn shipping on barges]"
23,22c58ec7-7ab8-3345-9a0d-7554eb6d7d07,NOV,2023-10-15,All Eyes On Iran For Security Of Oil Supply,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eyes-iran-security-oil-supply-230000515.html,1697324400,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Iran has become the focus of international attention in the wake of Hamas attacks on Israel that prompted large-scale retaliation as the make-or-break actor in what increasingly looks like a new war in the Middle East.While any war in the Middle East is a potential threat to oil supply security, one involving a producer the size of Iran could have even deeper implications for global oil markets. None of these implications are positive.Soon after the news of the attacks broke, there were reports claiming Iran, a supporter of Hamas, was involved in their planning. The information was denied by Tehran, while Israel and its biggest ally, the United States, said there was no evidence of Iran's involvement. Yet this did not stop U.S. Senator and vocal war hawk Lindsay Graham from calling on the U.S. to bomb Iranian refineries.That and similar calls from presidential hopeful Nikki Haley are essentially calls for an escalation of the conflict beyond sanctions, which many analysts see as the most likely course of action that Washington would follow. Such an escalation would quite probably send oil prices above $100 per barrel.Yet there is also another potential scenario where Iran is the actor taking a bigger role in the conflict.""The main thing to watch for is whether Iran becomes actively involved in the conflict and the reason why is because of Iran's proximity to the really crucial waterway called the Strait of Hormuz,"" Rapidan Energy Group's global oil service director Clay Siegle told Bloomberg this week.Related: U.S. Oil Rigs Decrease for Second Week Running, Gas Rigs RiseIndeed, the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian waters, is one of the biggest oil chokepoints in the world. The amount of oil that passes through the strait daily is around 17 million barrels of oil, which is equal to about 17% of global oil demand as forecast for this year. It is also equal to close to 90% of Middle Eastern oil that leaves the region via the Persian Gulf.Story continuesThe importance of the Strait of Hormuz occasionally makes headlines when Iran threatens to close it, which it does when tensions flare up between Tehran and the West. To say that tensions are currently flaring up would be an understatement, which makes the situation fraught with danger.The danger would spike—and so would prices—if we get to a point where Iran wants to close the Strait of Hormuz and the United States wants to keep it open. That would amount to a direct confrontation between the two that could not end well. For now, however, such a prospect seems remote.This is perhaps why prices have not really rallied after the Hamas attacks and Israel's retaliatory bombing of Gaza. Indeed, initially the benchmarks jumped but quickly retreated when the American Petroleum Institute reported a massive oil inventory build and the EIA confirmed it.Still, the potential for supply disruption remains significant. Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said this week that ""other fronts"" might open in the war, suggesting escalation is very definitely an option.At the same time, Iran's President talked with the Saudi Crown Prince as Saudi Arabia has taken the role of moderator, seeking to de-escalate the situation. Per an FT report on the conversation, Ebrahim Raisi said that both Iran and Saudi Arabia ""should defend the Muslim and oppressed nation of Palestine at this critical time.""Saudi Arabia, which has been recently working on a deal to build diplomatic relations with Israel, has refrained from taking a side. The U.S., however, just stopped the transfer of $6 billion to Iran as part of a prisoner swap deal, and that would quite likely make Tehran angry.""The money rightfully belongs to the people of Iran, earmarked for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to facilitate the acquisition of all essential and non-sanctioned requisites for the Iranians,"" the Iranian mission to the UN said, as quoted by the Wall Street Journal.That might be the first step of a potential escalation, especially if the hawks in Congress take the upper hand. Even the International Energy Agency has made a statement regarding the conflict and its potential impact on oil markets.""While there has been no direct impact on physical supply, markets will remain on tenterhooks as the crisis unfolds,"" the IEA said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report for October. The agency added it stood ready to act in case of a market disruption. The nature of the action remained undisclosed.Last year, the IEA, together with the U.S. released a massive amount of oil from inventories to arrest the oil price surge. As a result, the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve fell to the lowest in 40 years, equal to about 17 days of consumption, which makes a repeat of last year's release unlikely.An Iranian involvement in the war between Israel and Hamas would have a major effect on global oil supply security. Perhaps it is awareness of this fact that has motivated the diplomatic rush to an end to the fighting before it escalates.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Rystad Energy Sees Oil Prices Falling To $60 In 2027 As Demand PeaksCan Oil Prices Remain Below $90?Shell Anticipates Gas Trading Surge In Q4Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

I need natural gas, ready, cheap and available as a feedstock.”Mr Gardner delivered his warning about the site’s future directly to Labour’s leaders last week, leading a delegation of Ineos executives at the party’s annual conference in Liverpool. He has also met with Sir Keir.Grangemouth, which is part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos empire, is Scotland’s only remaining crude oil refinery, producing most of the petrol, diesel, heating oil and aviation fuel used in Scotland and other markets in northern England and Northern Ireland.It also supplies raw materials to the adjacent petrochemical and plastics plant run by Ineos Olefins and Polymers whose raw plastics and polymers go into UK products ranging from construction materials to clothing.Grangemouth relies on oil and gas from the North Sea for energy and raw materials and is fed by a direct pipeline linking it to 80 of the UK’s offshore oil and gas fields.Most of those fields are in decline but would normally be replaced by new wells. However, Labour plans to ban such new drilling if it wins power.Grangemouth, Scotland’s only remaining crude oil refinery, employs more than 2,000 workers - David Cheskin/PAThe Grangemouth plant, run by Petroineos, employs more than 2,000 workers and Mr Gardner’s warning prompted union chiefs to warn that North Sea workers risked becoming “the coal miners of our generation”.Ineos hopes to build a plant at Grangemouth that will turn natural gas into hydrogen, powering the entire complex with minimal emissions and preserving jobs and manufacturing. However, the scheme relies on having long-term supplies of natural gas.Story continuesMr Gardner said: “Our passion is to keep manufacturing in the UK and Europe. This is a critical time because parts of society want to outsource manufacturing, outsource jobs and import carbon.“And what I say is no, the best way is to absolutely turn that on its head. We want to stay in the UK and Europe, and we want to decarbonize in the UK, while keeping the manufacturing and jobs here.”A Labour spokesman declined to answer Gardner’s specific points but said: “Labour has committed to delivering industrial decarbonisation in Grangemouth, with a plan to invest £1bn across the country in protecting thousands of jobs in heavy industry as well as creating many more in CCS and hydrogen.”The warning from Mr Gardner risks inflaming tensions between Labour and its union backers.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Unite does not support the policy to stop all exploration licences in the North Sea. I have personally spoken to Keir Starmer on this issue and it remains key to our conversations with Labour. “We cannot allow oil and gas workers to become the coal miners of our generation. The Grangemouth site is of critical importance to the UK’s energy infrastructure and supply.”A government source said: “This is an example of how Labour’s reckless short term approach would sacrifice hundreds of thousands of British jobs, lead to higher emissions and endanger Britain’s energy security.”David Whitehouse, chief executive of Offshore Energies UK, the offshore industry’s trade body, said politicians needed to build a better understanding of the UK energy industry before issuing policy pronouncements.He said: “The oil and gas industry supports over 200,000 UK jobs, and over 90,000 of those are in Scotland. These are the same people with the skills needed to engineer a sustainable future. Companies like Ineos are developing the solutions we will need to reach net zero.”UK oil production hit an all-time low of 38m tonnes in 2022. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) predicts that without new wells it will plummet further to 22m tonnes by 2030.The NSTA’s annual Wells report shows the number of operating wells fell to 1,629 last year, compared with 2,052 in 2019. Another 900 have been mothballed.Gas production has fallen from its 2002 peak of 109 billion cubic metres (bcm) to 38bcm last year. Without new wells output will more than halve again, to 17bcm by 2030, the NSTA warns.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

(NYSE:ZTS) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-zoetis-inc-nyse-zts-110038580.html,1697367638,STORY,['ZTS'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:48% = US$2.2b ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.48.Does Zoetis Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Zoetis has a better ROE than the average (22%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Zoetis' Debt And Its 48% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Zoetis, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.43. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.As the stock market undergoes rollercoaster swings amid flurry of new data, analysts are still surprised by the outperformance of mega-cap stocks in the tech industry. The now famous “magnificent seven” group of tech stocks account for a major chunk of stock market gains this year. Many analysts believe these gains are expected to continue as the AI boom is just getting started. In the coming days there will be new product launches and AI announcements, while analysts are also expecting strong days ahead for e-commerce and tech stocks like Meta and Amazon amid the shopping season.Scott Chronert, Citi U.S. equity strategist, while talking to CNBC, recently said that he upgraded tech stocks after he saw valuations reset to attractive levels. The analyst said that over the past couple of months tech stocks had a pullback which made the companies in the sector investable again. Chronert said that if investors are looking to offset the effects of rising rates, tech stocks is the way to go.Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 12 mega-cap stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Big Company Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Big Company Stocks to Buy12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks 12th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 114 hedge funds reported having stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during this period was Boykin Curry’s  Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mulling a price hike after the end of the Hollywood strike.Story continuesPolen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks 11th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 121 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). The biggest stakeholder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $214 million stake in the company.Taiwan Economic Daily recently reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has increased its orders for advanced packaging to fulfill orders of processors that are especially made for artificial intelligenceArtisan Focus Fund made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Accelerated card sales are expected to grow from $5.2B to ~$50B in 2026. Just last year this $50B was expected to be $15B-$17B, signifying the massive inflection at hand. We believe this step function in demand almost entirely accrues to Nvidia, one of our winners in Q1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently does not have an AI-specific accelerated card but should be in the market by the end of the year, making it also compelling. Regardless, Nvidia’s software is the only game in town, and we believe it will ultimately be layered on top of AMD or any other cards that come up. We are early in this process and believe we have sized this market more accurately than other research providers, giving us an advantage in executing and generating alpha in this area over the coming years. Downstream, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is also an important holding for us and one of only three companies that is currently able to manufacture these accelerated cards at scale. Among the three, Taiwan Semiconductor is the most advanced. As seen below, the mix shift in compute spending in the accelerated format represents a massive TAM shift.”10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is seen as a potential AI play as the company released several AI features for its CRM platform earlier this year.Investment firm Baird recently said Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s Dreamforce conference was a positive for the company as it had a huge focus on AI.A total of 122 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.1 billion stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”9. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is showing massive insider selling activity, including selling from CEO Tim Cook. However, the latest weakness in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be the perfect entry point for long-term investors. Bank of America recently highlighted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s app store revenue in the third quarter jumped about 8.6% year over year.  Evercore ISI recently said in a report that the demand for iPhone 15 Pro remains strong everywhere except China and Japan.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The most significant stakeholder of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $178 billion stake in the company.Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ranks 8th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently said the report from the Wall Street Journal saying the company is mulling to hike credit card fees is wrong.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 139 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The most significant stakeholder of MA during this period was Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management which owns a $2.31 billion stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is enjoying massive consumer spending on travel. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its latest earnings call talked about travel spending patterns and its guidance:“Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the top big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been ruthlessly cutting costs in a bid to focus on profits and controlled growth. Those efforts are showing results. For the first time in history, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted an operating profit earlier this year when it posted results for the second quarter of 2023.  Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s net income in the period came in at $394 million, up $1.0 billion on a year-over-year basis.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 144 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s CEO talked about Uber’s future plans, using of AI and machine learning and cost discipline in Q2 earnings call:""Travel is a very important ecosystem for us, both in terms of pickups and drop-offs, and we have a very significant audience of international travelers and U.K. travelers. And we said, “Hey, why can’t we go after this tour operator market?” And essentially, we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators with what I will call the Uber Delight. We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we’re a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I’m going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there.And what we’re seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time. So, when we know it’s your morning commute on a Tuesday morning, we don’t offer you the Eurostar, but when we think that you might be open to new and different ways of using the Uber, and we want to be your kind of the operating system for everyday life, not just for you to go to work, but to be that travel companion as well, we will extend those services, offer those services. We’ve now expanded into flights as well. And we’re actually seeing engagement with users being higher than we thought, and we’re not seeing cannibalization of the base business. So, we’re quite hopeful of that business. And again, that tour operator market in the U.K. is a very, very large market that we can go after.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor for the quarter following better than expected 1Q23 earnings and 2Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $31.4 billion were up 22% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $15 billion grew 44% over the last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of those companies that continue to remain strong even during volatile times due to the “essential” nature of the services they provide.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Expedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Expedia Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Expedia Group How Fast Is Expedia Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In the last three years Expedia Group's earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. In impressive fashion, Expedia Group's EPS grew from US$2.14 to US$6.27, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 193% year-on-year growth like that.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Expedia Group achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$12b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Expedia Group's future profits.Story continuesAre Expedia Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Expedia Group has a market capitalisation of US$15b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$651m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Expedia Group, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Expedia Group's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$1.1m in the year prior to December 2022. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add Expedia Group To Your Watchlist?Expedia Group's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The cherry on top is that insiders own a bucket-load of shares, and the CEO pay seems really quite reasonable. The strong EPS improvement suggests the businesses is humming along. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Expedia Group is worth considering carefully. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Expedia Group   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for PulteGroup How Fast Is PulteGroup Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Recognition must be given to the that PulteGroup has grown EPS by 43% per year, over the last three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't sustainable for long, it certainly catches the eye of prospective investors.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. PulteGroup maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$17b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for PulteGroup.Story continuesAre PulteGroup Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of PulteGroup, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$109m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add PulteGroup To Your Watchlist?PulteGroup's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, PulteGroup is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for PulteGroup  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the current trends in the marketing industry, you can directly go to the 5 Creative Ways to Attract Customers.As consumerism rises and more businesses join the market daily, it becomes harder to establish a name for your business. The marketing industry is ever-changing, with new trends getting popularized every few days. Just the digital marketing industry in the US was evaluated to be around $223.2 billion in the year 2022. The CAGR for the 2022-2030 period is expected to be 13.9%, with the industry reaching over $1 trillion by 2030. The impact of the sector is not just limited to the US alone. China’s digital marketing industry is predicted to reach $372.6 billion by the year 2030. Other countries dominating the market are Japan, Canada, Australia, Germany, India, and South Korea. With an estimated 4.89 billion social media users in 2023, with the average user bouncing between seven different platforms, the digital space offers much higher potential to marketers at much lower costs. At the same time, this accessibility means that the demand for creative marketing has also risen. According to Kantar, creative quality accounts for almost 50% of campaign success and is one of the most important factors in building brand impact. Ispos has awarded much higher importance to this element, saying that creative quality may determine as much as 75% of ad impact. The Case for Creativity has also discovered that campaigns that receive accolades for creativity tend to perform 27% better. In the current context of the digital space, as well as traditional marketing, creativity goes hand-in-hand with data-driven strategies. McKinsey has termed data-driven marketing as the ‘next normal’, explaining that data-driven tactics generate an ROI five to eight times higher than usual. The change in consumer behaviors after the pandemic has also increased the need to find better data in order to improve precision marketing. Thus, McKinsey deems tech investment as one of the key elements for any business to improve their standard marketing procedures. New tech advancements make up for many creative ways that can be used to attract customers in 2023. This can only happen through investment in agile technologies. Story continuesCreative and data-driven marketing combines insights from various segments like performance, content, audience, competitor, and channel to help you formulate cohesive strategies that work for your particular business. All the biggest brands in the world have adopted this methodology in recent years, coming up with unique advertisement campaigns that are particular to only their business. Not only have these campaigns delivered successful results, but they’ve also managed to gather massive popularity for their unique elements. The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity has specific award segments for the advertising industry, showcasing the importance of creativity in marketing. In 2016, Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) launched the ‘Live There’ campaign, which included several videos for potential customers to get an idea about the culture and tourist attractions of the locations they planned to visit. The campaign featured real-life Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) hosts, who aimed to popularize the company as more than just a short-term rental, marketing it as a way to experience destinations like the locals. According to Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), the campaign increased website traffic by 32% and bookings by 27%. It also led to a 50% increase in home listings, owing to the positive media coverage that was generated by it. The campaign ran across digital platforms and out-of-home channels, making this an excellent example of a cross-channel marketing strategy. Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), in 2018, also adopted a brilliant marketing campaign to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its ‘Just Do It’ slogan. The ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign was kickstarted by the former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, and its main idea was to encourage individuals to keep pursuing their big dreams despite whatever challenges they may face. The campaign managed to generate over 65 million views in just five days through a video of Kaepernick, which emphasizes its popularity. While the campaign generated some controversy due to its featuring of Kaepernick, there were others who commended the corporation for taking this bold and powerful step. Immediately after the sale, Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) reported that its sales jumped a whopping 31%. It also added $6 billion in value to Nike’s brand. A crucial element for success behind all these brand campaigns is determining which channels they should utilize to reach the right target audience. For its ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign, Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) put its primary focus on YouTube instead of Facebook, which has been the company’s most-used platform for the majority of its campaigns. The reason behind this was an understanding of which platform was the best in terms of attracting customers. HubSpot considers Facebook by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) to be the primary content distribution channel used by marketers today, but that doesn’t mean it is the best option out there. Other social media channels by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), such as Instagram, have also revolutionized the world of marketing and customer acquisition. The age segment of 16-24, mainly referred to as Gen Z, prefers Instagram over other social media channels. This makes Instagram the perfect advertising ground for all companies that are targeting to reach this age bracket. The potential ad audience for just Instagram Reels can reach up to 758.5 million, while the total ad revenue for the company is predicted to reach $50.58 billion in 2023. Another recent platform by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) called Threads acquired 100 million users within five days of its launch, giving marketers a new channel to work upon. However, the platform's momentum has waned as of late. Based on the accumulation of all this information, one can safely infer that in 2023, there are plenty of creative marketing strategies to attract customers. The only thing that matters is a business’s ability to adapt to the changing technological environment while consistently prioritizing innovation in advertising. To help our readers, we have compiled a list of 20 creative ways to attract customers according to us, which includes everything new that is happening in the world of advertising. Also see 20 Most Profitable Small Businesses and 20 Low-Cost Franchises with High Profits.20 Creative Ways to Attract CustomersMelpomene/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo develop this list of creative ways to attract customers in business, we have quantified our rankings based on various sources, including expert opinion. Our sources include Forbes, HubSpot, and Indeed, among others, with the opinions of marketing and advertising experts working in various corporations. Based on this methodology, here are 20 creative strategies for attracting more customers to your business. 20. Use Buy Now, Pay Later SchemesScore: 01The Buy Now, Pay Later (BPNL) scheme has been quite popular for a few years, but it needs much more credit as a creative way to attract customers to your business. The BPNL payment option works because of the principle of instant gratification. It offers consumers something right away without the need to work for it. BPNL reduces the perceived cost of the purchases, making customers more likely to spend that money. 19. Capitalize On EmotionsScore: 02The campaign by Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) worked because the brand managed to create an emotional connection with its customers that also tied in with its core values of healthy living, inspiration, and motivation. Dove by Unilever plc (NYSE:UL) launched a similar campaign called ‘Real Beauty’, which focused on promoting self-love and acceptance of your own bodies. Just like the one by Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), this campaign performed well because it had an emotional element that most Dove consumers could connect with. Unilever plc (NYSE:UL) as a whole won 19 awards at the 2022 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, showcasing its emphasis on creative ways to attract customers. 18. Add A Cinematic Lens To Your Video Content Score: 03Video content has become the primary format for almost all brands in the past few years, due to its rising popularity amidst decreasing attention spans. But when every business out there makes videos, you need another creative way to attract customers. A cinematic video campaign by Spongellé, a bath products brand, amped up its ROAS by 3.21x. Research shows that more than 90% of consumers in 2023 want to see brand videos, and filming them in a cinematic format makes the products feel much more real, helping the consumers connect with your brand. 17. Embrace Filter-less Posts For Authenticity Score: 04Brand authenticity positively impacts the consumer experience and increases consumer loyalty and trust. Research shows that 70% of consumers spend more on brands they find authentic. Authenticity refers to the brand representing its core values and issues that it cares about, but it also includes how the brand acts in the digital space. Jenny Li Fowler, Director of Social Media Strategy at MIT, mentions that ‘unpolished’ feeds and filter-less pictures are now the future of Instagram, making them one of the most creative ways to attract customers in 2023. 16. Support A Social CauseScore: 05This is in a similar vein as authenticity, but brands that showcase support for social causes that are relevant to their brand values tend to be well-liked by customers. A 2017 study by Cone Communications found that 63% of Americans want brands to work on social change, and 87% of Americans are likely to purchase from a brand that promotes causes that they themselves care about. When  Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) picked Colin Kaepernick for its campaign, it was the brand’s way of vocalizing its support for the BLM movement. Ben &amp; Jerry’s, another brand by Unilever plc (NYSE:UL), has also been quite vocal in supporting the BLM movement and other social causes like labor rights. 15. Use Guest Posting To Your AdvantageScore: 06A case study showed that using a guest posting strategy can increase traffic to your own website by a whopping 20%. Some of the most common formats for guest posts are listicles and step-by-step how-to guides. The only catch is being able to select the right website to write for so your content reaches its intended audience. 14. Tap Into Social CommerceScore: 07According to Insider Intelligence, social commerce managed to generate $53.10 billion in revenue in 2022, a 34.4% increase from 2021. They also found that TikTok picked up its pace in the social commerce industry, with the number of US buyers growing by 72.3% in 2023. Considering that 64% of internet users (as noted by GWI) in the US use social media to discover brands, social e-commerce has a vast potential to upscale sales in the coming years. 13. Unconventional Platforms Present Massive Potential Score: 08The majority of businesses remain limited to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn; however, the past year has shown that unconventional platform choices can work wonders for your business. Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) reported an 8% year-on-year increase in revenue in Q3 of 2022, most of which happened due to its commerce initiatives. Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) has been a significant source for discovering trends and new products, something that the brand has capitalized on. 12. Unique Experiences For Top CustomersScore: 09Satisfied repeat customers tend to spend more and have a high customer lifetime value, so getting them to stick around helps businesses massively. But this means more than just offering the occasional discount or so. Providing them with early access to sales or new products, factoring in their feedback, organizing exclusive events, and holding regular touchpoints with them are all ways to keep repeat customers invested in your business in the long term. 11. Offer Genuine Free-Of-Cost ResourcesScore: 10According to experts like Sprout Social and Post Modern Marketing, offering genuine and free resources is a brilliant way to build consumer loyalty and trust. One of the most creative ways to attract customers is to focus on building customer relationships that go beyond sales, and the best strategy for doing that is to present yourself as a helpful brand without any strings attached. 10. Branch Out To Video TestimonialsScore: 11According to Wyzowl, 77% of individuals who see video testimonials mention that it motivates them to make a purchase. In the world of video-driven content, video testimonials are more likely to impact consumers because they feel much more personal and authentic. Getting customers to make these testimonials may be harder, but the results are worth it. 9. Offer Customer Milestone Discounts Score: 12On average, 65% of a business’s revenue comes from customers with repeat purchases. In order to get consumers to stick around for long, it’s essential to develop a relationship with them. Offering discounts for milestones like a customer’s birthday or the date of their first purchase can go a long way in establishing that relationship. 8. Use Consumer Personas For PersonalizationScore: 13Hubspot notes that 78% of marketers think that personalization has a substantial impact on customer relationships because consumers are tired of receiving generic messages. Curating buyer personas and then utilizing them for the personalization of all channels, especially email marketing, is a brilliant and creative way to attract more customers. 7. Do Shared Promotions With Complimentary Businesses Score: 14Imagine making a purchase at Barnes &amp; Noble and getting a free coffee at the attached Starbucks. Partnering up with complimentary businesses is more than just selling together now; you can band together to leverage social media to your advantage. Shared promotions will save money, expand your market reach, and help your business stand out. 6. Use VR/AR To Bring Your Audience Closer Score: 15 Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) has AR tools for seeing how makeup or furniture would look in real-life settings. Multiple other brands have utilized this tool to help consumers get a sense of the production ‘in action’. Incorporating this strategy can be a super creative way to attract customers because it lets them test your product from the comfort of their homes.Click to continue reading and see 5 Creative Ways to Attract Customers.Suggested Articles:15 Best Marketing Software for Small BusinessesTop 20 Digital Marketing Companies and Agencies in the World10 Biggest Social Media Companies In AsiaDisclosure: None. 20 Creative Ways to Attract Customers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Their customers aren't.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-banks-are-benefiting-from-higher-rates-their-customers-arent-114710082.html,1697370430,STORY,"['JPM', 'C', 'PNC', 'WFC']","[Higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation’s biggest banks. They aren’t doing the same for the banks’ customers.Earnings for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income.Their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals.These advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits.That number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. Together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year.Yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. The combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago.The total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020.At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser warned that US consumers were cutting back. “Continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,” she said in a release.Affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. Citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said even as the economy remains resilient “we are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly.”Story continuesWells Fargo had charge-offs of $850 million, $622 million from consumer loans. The bank expects its net interest income to fall 3% from the third quarter to the fourth.""Where Wells Fargo sees weaknesses,"" according to CFO Mike Santomassimo, is in commercial real estate, and ""I think we will see some loss pickup in that portfolio over time.""Charlie Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo. (Mike Blake/REUTERS) (Mike Blake / reuters)JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon struck a more somber tone. He said consumers and businesses “generally remain healthy” but consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers at a time when inflation risks remain elevated, increasing the possibility that interest rates could go even higher.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.He admitted that the bank has been “over-earning on both net interest income and below normal credit costs, both of which will normalize over time.” He told reporters there is a “big debate” within the bank about when that normalization will happen.“I personally think it will happen a little sooner than Jeremy,” he said, referring to his CFO.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)Dimon, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence director for financial institutions research Nathan Stovall told Yahoo Finance on Friday, was “trying to throw out some caution.”The bank, he added, knows credit costs are going to go up. “They are trying to prepare the Street that you could see tougher times ahead.”One regional bank, PNC (PNC), demonstrated the problems that smaller lenders have navigating this period of higher rates. Its profits and revenue fell from a year ago, as did its net interest income. It expects net interest income to fall again in the fourth quarter when compared to the third.The Pittsburgh bank said it would reduce its staff by roughly 4%, saving $325 million. Several other regional banks, including Truist (TFC), have also eliminated jobs in recent months as they adjust to more uncertain economic conditions.PNC’s stock fell 3% Friday while Citigroup's stock sold off slightly in the later part of the day. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both rose.""The inflection point,"" PNC CEO William Demchak said in response to a question about whether PNC's net interest income had reached a trough, ""I think is entirely dependent on what happens with the Fed in the coming year.""Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
43,dceda8b0-f3dd-33ec-b3ca-db03e90bc02e,WFC,2023-10-15,13 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-blue-chip-stocks-164712847.html,1697302032,STORY,"['PYPL', 'C', 'DDOG', 'MU', 'PFE', 'OXY', 'TECK', 'WFC']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best blue chip stocks under $100. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100.Global markets have started to see the real effects of rising interest rates. Consumer spending is expected to decline in the coming weeks and months as inflation remains elevated, mainly due to a sharp rise in energy prices. According to an October report from Merrill, which quotes, EIA’s data, Brent oil in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to average at around $93 per barrel.Merrill also said that the era of easy money might be over and the coming days and weeks will show how companies and individuals deal with this reality. The report said:“Borrowers (both public and private) will need to deal with the repercussions of almost 15 years of near-zero interest rate policies, which drove a significant increase in aggregate debt levels across public and private markets. This has several important implications, particularly for lower-quality, high-yield and loan issuers, where debt-service burdens are higher relative to earnings, and defaults are already on the rise. For Investment-grade (IG) investors, the answer is more nuanced. While debt growth in the IG corporate market has led to a notable deterioration in credit quality over time, this is a well understood trend, and we expect that most IG issuers will face just minor challenges should rates indeed stay higher for longer. Furthermore, in the longer term, higher debt costs could lead to more conservatism on behalf of management teams with regard to balance sheet leverage and management. A bigger potential longer-term worry, however, could be growing U.S. government debt as issuance needs remain elevated given rising deficits. This is a key risk factor that we see supporting the higher-for-longer view on yields and will be something to watch closely over the next several quarters.”Some analysts were expecting the Fed to start rate cuts in 2024 but the latest jobs report might have dampened those hopes. RBC Wealth Management in a September report had said that the Federal Reserve could start to cut rates if weak economic data comes especially on the employment front. That hope was crushed on October 6 when the latest report showed US labor market remains strong. The RBC report however said that 2024 will be difficult for the stock market as the firm expects recession and market slowdown during the year. While the firm still recommends investors to pile into stocks for the long term, it said investors should only buy those individual stocks which can do well during recessions and inflation. RBC said while the jury is still out on whether we are headed for hard or soft landing, it does expect recession to hit the US stock market soon. Among the biggest reasons behind this rationale is rising interest rates and drying US household savings, which were built up during the pandemic era.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks Under $100Photo by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 blue chip stocks trading under $100 with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years.

(NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”8.

Gross margin to be in the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points. And operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL): PayPal shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite reporting better than anticipated 1Q earnings and raising guidance for the remainder of 2023. Revenue of $7 billion grew 9% year over year, an acceleration from the prior year and quarter. EPS of 1.17 grew 33% year over year on better cost discipline leading to better operating margins. The disappointment was centered around weaker gross margins, as unbranded checkout, which has lower gross margins, accelerated faster than branded checkout. Management anticipates this trend to continue and therefore guided to lower gross margins for the remainder of the year. Despite the gross margin headwind, operating margins continue to expand due to expense discipline.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet – providing the purest exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 1Q non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel at least a high teens earnings growth rate over the next five years.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100.Global markets have started to see the real effects of rising interest rates. Consumer spending is expected to decline in the coming weeks and months as inflation remains elevated, mainly due to a sharp rise in energy prices. According to an October report from Merrill, which quotes, EIA’s data, Brent oil in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to average at around $93 per barrel.Merrill also said that the era of easy money might be over and the coming days and weeks will show how companies and individuals deal with this reality. The report said:“Borrowers (both public and private) will need to deal with the repercussions of almost 15 years of near-zero interest rate policies, which drove a significant increase in aggregate debt levels across public and private markets. This has several important implications, particularly for lower-quality, high-yield and loan issuers, where debt-service burdens are higher relative to earnings, and defaults are already on the rise. For Investment-grade (IG) investors, the answer is more nuanced. While debt growth in the IG corporate market has led to a notable deterioration in credit quality over time, this is a well understood trend, and we expect that most IG issuers will face just minor challenges should rates indeed stay higher for longer. Furthermore, in the longer term, higher debt costs could lead to more conservatism on behalf of management teams with regard to balance sheet leverage and management. A bigger potential longer-term worry, however, could be growing U.S. government debt as issuance needs remain elevated given rising deficits. This is a key risk factor that we see supporting the higher-for-longer view on yields and will be something to watch closely over the next several quarters.”Some analysts were expecting the Fed to start rate cuts in 2024 but the latest jobs report might have dampened those hopes. RBC Wealth Management in a September report had said that the Federal Reserve could start to cut rates if weak economic data comes especially on the employment front. That hope was crushed on October 6 when the latest report showed US labor market remains strong. The RBC report however said that 2024 will be difficult for the stock market as the firm expects recession and market slowdown during the year. While the firm still recommends investors to pile into stocks for the long term, it said investors should only buy those individual stocks which can do well during recessions and inflation. RBC said while the jury is still out on whether we are headed for hard or soft landing, it does expect recession to hit the US stock market soon. Among the biggest reasons behind this rationale is rising interest rates and drying US household savings, which were built up during the pandemic era.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks Under $100Photo by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 blue chip stocks trading under $100 with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”10. Citigroup Inc.

(NYSE:C) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We’ve recently been adding to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years. Meanwhile, you collect the 4.5% annual dividend, which is currently a better yield than long-term treasuries.9. Datadog, Inc.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries with the Most COVID-19 Cases in the World in 2023.The Global Pandemic: A Historical OverviewAs reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first cases of a pneumonia-like novel illness which had symptoms of fever and shortness of breath were identified among a group of residents in Wuhan in December, 2019. However, the pandemic was not identified as Coronavirus until the World Health Organization (WHO) used the term '2019 Novel Coronavirus' in January 2021. With cases rising in Thailand, Korea, Japan and the United States, this virus was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and was shortly named ‘Covid-19’ by WHO. It was not until late 2020 that vaccines from global pharmaceutical companies came into play against the pandemic. While the vaccines were being administered, variants of the Coronavirus named alpha, beta, and gamma were reported in different parts of the world. The Delta and Omicron variants followed suit.  Current Situation of the Global PandemicOn September 29, WHO reported that more than 770 million Covid-19 cases and over 6 million deaths have been reported from all over the world, as of September 24. The new cases from August 28 to September 24 decreased by 55% as compared to the 4 weeks prior to the mentioned period. The total reported deaths also went down by 34% during this period.On October 12, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported an update about the pandemic in the EU region. According to this update, the pandemic was most affecting older people, aged 65 or above, from October 1 to October 8. In half of the EU region, rates of respiratory illnesses and acute respiratory infection were on the rise, as a result of an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Story continuesThe Disruptive Invention: The COVID-19 VaccineThe vaccine for COVID-19 was a critical invention to address the global health crisis from the pandemic. Some of the primary and key manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines include Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA). They are also some of the best COVID-19 stocks to invest in.On December 11, 2020, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) joined hands with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to leverage its proprietary mRNA technology to create a vaccine for the global pandemic, first authorized in the US on an emergency basis. This vaccine is allowed for use at some level in most countries. Studies indicate that COVID-19 follows a seasonal pattern with rising numbers during fall and winter. On September 14, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) reported that its vaccine for the new season is currently available across the United States. This vaccine has been made to offer protection against several Omicron sub-variants since 85% of the current COVID-19 cases in America are caused by Omicron XBB strains. The company recently secured authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines for individuals aged 12 years and above can be ordered as a single-dose vial or a prefilled syringe. However, emergency use authorization has been given for those between 6 months and 11 years of age.AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) collaborated with Oxford University to develop the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID‑19 vaccine which is given by an intramuscular injection. Generally, the side effects of the vaccine in the form of headache, nausea, and injection site pain tend to reduce within some days. On January 4, 2021, the first vaccination was administered outside a trial by the company. By January 2022, more than 2.5 billion vaccine doses had been released to almost 170 countries. On October 11, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) reported that it will be presenting real-world evidence regarding the risk of serious infectious diseases at the 12th annual IDWeek which is a premier event for discussing infectious diseases, from October 11 to October 15. The company reveals that immunocompromised individuals are most vulnerable to COVID-19, even when they are fully vaccinated. According to the company, AZD3152 is a long lasting antibody that can offer protection against COVID-19 in these vulnerable patients.Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) also introduced an mRNA vaccine against Coronavirus. This was the second vaccine after the Pfizer vaccine, which secured emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) on December 18, 2020. In 2022, Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent was authorized as a booster dose for individuals older than 18, in the UK, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, the US, and the EU. On October 4, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) reported that it has been working on a combination vaccine ‘mRNA-1083’ against Influenza and COVID-19. The vaccine will be entering the phase 3 trial since positive results have been obtained regarding its safety and effectiveness as compared to other licensed Influenza vaccines. The company also plans to seek regulatory approval for this combination vaccine in 2025.Now that we have taken a look at the global pandemic situation, we can move to the 20 countries with the most COVID-19 cases in the world in 2023.20 Countries with the Most COVID-19 Cases in the World in 202320 Countries with the Most COVID-19 Cases in the World in 2023Our Methodology:In order to compile a list of the 20 countries with the most COVID-19 cases, we sourced data from the World Health Organization’s Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard.

49,dceda8b0-f3dd-33ec-b3ca-db03e90bc02e,PYPL,2023-10-15,13 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-blue-chip-stocks-164712847.html,1697302032,STORY,"['PYPL', 'C', 'DDOG', 'MU', 'PFE', 'OXY', 'TECK', 'WFC']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best blue chip stocks under $100. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100.Global markets have started to see the real effects of rising interest rates. Consumer spending is expected to decline in the coming weeks and months as inflation remains elevated, mainly due to a sharp rise in energy prices. According to an October report from Merrill, which quotes, EIA’s data, Brent oil in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to average at around $93 per barrel.Merrill also said that the era of easy money might be over and the coming days and weeks will show how companies and individuals deal with this reality. The report said:“Borrowers (both public and private) will need to deal with the repercussions of almost 15 years of near-zero interest rate policies, which drove a significant increase in aggregate debt levels across public and private markets. This has several important implications, particularly for lower-quality, high-yield and loan issuers, where debt-service burdens are higher relative to earnings, and defaults are already on the rise. For Investment-grade (IG) investors, the answer is more nuanced. While debt growth in the IG corporate market has led to a notable deterioration in credit quality over time, this is a well understood trend, and we expect that most IG issuers will face just minor challenges should rates indeed stay higher for longer. Furthermore, in the longer term, higher debt costs could lead to more conservatism on behalf of management teams with regard to balance sheet leverage and management. A bigger potential longer-term worry, however, could be growing U.S. government debt as issuance needs remain elevated given rising deficits. This is a key risk factor that we see supporting the higher-for-longer view on yields and will be something to watch closely over the next several quarters.”Some analysts were expecting the Fed to start rate cuts in 2024 but the latest jobs report might have dampened those hopes. RBC Wealth Management in a September report had said that the Federal Reserve could start to cut rates if weak economic data comes especially on the employment front. That hope was crushed on October 6 when the latest report showed US labor market remains strong. The RBC report however said that 2024 will be difficult for the stock market as the firm expects recession and market slowdown during the year. While the firm still recommends investors to pile into stocks for the long term, it said investors should only buy those individual stocks which can do well during recessions and inflation. RBC said while the jury is still out on whether we are headed for hard or soft landing, it does expect recession to hit the US stock market soon. Among the biggest reasons behind this rationale is rising interest rates and drying US household savings, which were built up during the pandemic era.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks Under $100Photo by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 blue chip stocks trading under $100 with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”12. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is one of the biggest pharma companies in the world. Pfizer Inc.

Additionally, in 2023, management is increasing spend as the company invests in new product launches. That said, we remain positive about the long-term company fundamentals.”11. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) ranks 11th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100 according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC).

Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) has been cutting its workforce since 2023.Here is what Tweedy, Browne has to say about Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Funds received very little in the way of return contributions from many of their financial, energy, media, and healthcare holdings. While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”10. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) ranks 10th in our list of the best blue chip stocks under $100 to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). The biggest stake in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $2.5 billion stake in the company.Earlier this year Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) upped its dividend by 3.9%.Latest reports suggest that Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is getting ready for a major restructuring that would include reassignments, retraining and layoffs of employees.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy made the following comment about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We’ve recently been adding to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years. Meanwhile, you collect the 4.5% annual dividend, which is currently a better yield than long-term treasuries.9. Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Cloud applications security and monitoring platform company Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) ranks 9th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100 according to hedge funds.  Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) is a potential AI play as AI applications based on Cloud see an exponential increase. Earlier this month, Piper Sandler upgraded Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) adding that the company is showing ""signs of stability"" as well as a boost from artificial intelligence.Pipe Sandler’s analyst Rob Owens upped his rating for the stock to Overweight from Neutral and gave a $115 price target.""We favor the disruptive nature of the company's solutions, think its platform play will continue to resonate and believe its best days are still ahead,” Owens said.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”8. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Natural resources company Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) shares have gained about 24% over the past one year. Analysts believe Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a buy on expectations that the company would be acquired in part or full by Glencore.

Copper is seeing a rising demand in the world amid electrification.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 79 hedge funds had stakes in Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK). The biggest stakeholder of Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which owns a $424 million stake in the company.7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained about 37% year to date. For the fiscal first quarter, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) expects sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.6 billion. MU ranks x in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100.Here’s what Micron Technology, Inc.

We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry’s most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND. Micron’s leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.As of the end of the second quarter of 223, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). The biggest stakeholder of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $425 million stake in the company.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares were owned by 86 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) during this period was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $381 million stake in the company.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares saw a ratings cut from  MoffettNathanson as the firm expects PayPal to face tough competition from Apple Pay and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)'s Cash App.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL): PayPal shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite reporting better than anticipated 1Q earnings and raising guidance for the remainder of 2023. Revenue of $7 billion grew 9% year over year, an acceleration from the prior year and quarter. EPS of 1.17 grew 33% year over year on better cost discipline leading to better operating margins. The disappointment was centered around weaker gross margins, as unbranded checkout, which has lower gross margins, accelerated faster than branded checkout. Management anticipates this trend to continue and therefore guided to lower gross margins for the remainder of the year. Despite the gross margin headwind, operating margins continue to expand due to expense discipline.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet – providing the purest exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 1Q non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel at least a high teens earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None. 13 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Their customers aren't.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-banks-are-benefiting-from-higher-rates-their-customers-arent-114710082.html,1697370430,STORY,"['JPM', 'C', 'PNC', 'WFC']","[Higher interest rates are lifting the fortunes of the nation’s biggest banks. They aren’t doing the same for the banks’ customers.Earnings for JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all rose in the third quarter largely because high rates allowed them to rake in more interest income.Their scale allows them to leverage those rates by charging more for loans while holding down how much more they pay for deposits when compared to smaller rivals.These advantages show up in a key profitability metric known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks make on their loans and pay for their deposits.That number was up by sizable amounts at all three banks when compared to the same period a year ago. Together the lenders pulled in a record $50 billion, 18% more than the same period last year. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo even lifted their guidance for how much net interest income they would earn for the full year.Yet there were also clear signs that some of their borrowers are starting to struggle. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all increased the amount of loans they wrote off as losses. The combined charge-offs at those three banks totaled $3.98 billion, up 31% from the previous quarter and 105% from the same period a year ago.The total was the highest amount collectively for the three lenders since the early days of the pandemic, in the second quarter of 2020.At Citigroup, CEO Jane Fraser warned that US consumers were cutting back. “Continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer,” she said in a release.Affluent customers, she added, are accounting for almost all of the spending growth and weakness is showing among those with lower credit scores. Citi expects its credit card losses to reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said even as the economy remains resilient “we are seeing the impact of the slowing economy with loan balances declining and charge-offs continuing to deteriorate modestly.”Story continuesWells Fargo had charge-offs of $850 million, $622 million from consumer loans. The bank expects its net interest income to fall 3% from the third quarter to the fourth.""Where Wells Fargo sees weaknesses,"" according to CFO Mike Santomassimo, is in commercial real estate, and ""I think we will see some loss pickup in that portfolio over time.""Charlie Scharf, CEO of Wells Fargo. (Mike Blake/REUTERS) (Mike Blake / reuters)JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon struck a more somber tone. He said consumers and businesses “generally remain healthy” but consumers are spending down their excess cash buffers at a time when inflation risks remain elevated, increasing the possibility that interest rates could go even higher.Wars in Ukraine and Israel, he added, could also impact energy, food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,"" he said.He admitted that the bank has been “over-earning on both net interest income and below normal credit costs, both of which will normalize over time.” He told reporters there is a “big debate” within the bank about when that normalization will happen.“I personally think it will happen a little sooner than Jeremy,” he said, referring to his CFO.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. (Evelyn Hockstein/REUTERS) (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)Dimon, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence director for financial institutions research Nathan Stovall told Yahoo Finance on Friday, was “trying to throw out some caution.”The bank, he added, knows credit costs are going to go up. “They are trying to prepare the Street that you could see tougher times ahead.”One regional bank, PNC (PNC), demonstrated the problems that smaller lenders have navigating this period of higher rates.

54,ff93e078-56a6-385b-b7b0-4dd6627ca108,CSX,2023-10-15,CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Will Pay A Dividend Of $0.11,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-nasdaq-csx-pay-dividend-120733475.html,1697371653,STORY,['CSX'],"[CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.11 per share on the 15th of December. This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.4%, which is below the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before making this announcement, CSX was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 15.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 20%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.187, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.44. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.0% a year over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.CSX May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, CSX's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 2.4% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Our Thoughts On CSX's DividendIn summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

This is typically when consumer spending is at its highest, and the economy sees a strong recovery. We are doing much better now than when the year started, and there are several travel stocks to buy that are ready to take home big gains. This is a great time for the companies to see revenue growth. With oil prices soaring you would think that people would be choosing to stay close to home. However, reports show a record number of Americans have already booked their holiday travel and beyond.Smart investors know that investing in travel stocks now will mean significant gains in the next few months. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the three travel stocks to buy that are ready to roar. Walt Disney (DIS)Entrance to Walt Disney World park. DIS stock.Source: VIAVAL TOURS / ShutterstockThe entertainment icon Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been on a tumultuous ride over the past few months. It suffered during the pandemic and is slowly regaining ground. However, the stock is down 6% year-to-date (YTD). The company did report impressive financials in a tough market. In the recent quarter, it reported a revenue of $22.33 billion, a 3.84% year-over-year (YOY) rise. On the other hand, it saw a massive drop in the net income and earnings per share (EPS). The EPS came in at $1.03 but managed to beat expectations. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith a diversified business, Disney has the potential to bounce back in the near term. In an attempt to attract customers to its parks, Disney has decided to offer discounts on children’s tickets until early next year. This could boost the attendance during the holiday season. It also plans to invest about $60 billion in parks over the next ten years. It is a cash cow for the company and Disney has steadily tried to look for ways to increase attendance and boost hotel room occupancy. Its investment has also paid off since the parks division saw a revenue of $8.3 billion, a 13% rise in the recent quarter.Story continuesDIS stock is trading at a discount and is a good buy at the current level. Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL)Deck of a Royal Caribbean (RCL) cruise ship looking over the oceanSource: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.comIf you are investing in travel stocks, I’d recommend you diversify by investing across different sectors. Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) has seen a massive upside in the last 12 months. RCL stock is up 121% in the past 12 months and 86% YTD. In the second quarter, the company saw a revenue of $3.52 billion which is a 61% YOY growth and the net income increased by 188% year-over-year to hit $458.8 million. The numbers are encouraging and it shows that the company is moving in the right direction. The company has seen an upsurge in bookings for 2024 as compared to the previous year and while the demand will remain below the 2020 levels, the company has a long way to go. I believe this stock rally will continue through 2024. One reason why investors were always worried about this stock was the debt-heavy balance sheet but as business improves, the company will also improve its credit position. In the second quarter, it repaid $1.6 billion in debt. The interest expense will also be sizeable on the debt but the company is now generating cash flow and could be soon in a position to refinance the debt. Airbnb (ABNB)Woman holds the key with the logo of a popular company Airbnb over the landscape of Genova, Italy. ABNB stock.Source: AlesiaKan / ShutterstockHaving recovered from the huge blow from the pandemic, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is standing strong and is one of the top travel stocks to buy. While there is a lot of skepticism around the future of the company, I believe we shouldn’t write it off just yet. Its financials are proof that the company is doing well and the second quarter reports show sales of $2.5 billion, an 18% jump YOY. It also ended the quarter with a free cash flow of $900 million and the results have shown that guests are still looking for longer stays. The company’s success lies behind the massive network it owns. With more than 4 million hosts, it offers unique stays at even the most remote places. In the quarter, it saw 115 million nights booked and I believe this number will be higher during Christmas. As more people look to enjoy their experience at an Airbnb over a hotel, the platform continues to attract hosts. This is a positive sign and one that is generating revenue for the company.It is always working on ways to improve its products and services to offer better experiences to customers. I believe the third quarter numbers will be impressive due to Summer travel and the stock momentum will continue. On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.As the stock market undergoes rollercoaster swings amid flurry of new data, analysts are still surprised by the outperformance of mega-cap stocks in the tech industry. The now famous “magnificent seven” group of tech stocks account for a major chunk of stock market gains this year. Many analysts believe these gains are expected to continue as the AI boom is just getting started. In the coming days there will be new product launches and AI announcements, while analysts are also expecting strong days ahead for e-commerce and tech stocks like Meta and Amazon amid the shopping season.Scott Chronert, Citi U.S. equity strategist, while talking to CNBC, recently said that he upgraded tech stocks after he saw valuations reset to attractive levels. The analyst said that over the past couple of months tech stocks had a pullback which made the companies in the sector investable again. Chronert said that if investors are looking to offset the effects of rising rates, tech stocks is the way to go.Our MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 12 mega-cap stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Big Company Stocks to BuyImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest Big Company Stocks to Buy12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ranks 12th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 114 hedge funds reported having stakes in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). The biggest stakeholder of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during this period was Boykin Curry’s  Eagle Capital Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in the company.Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mulling a price hike after the end of the Hollywood strike.Story continuesPolen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”11. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ranks 11th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 121 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). The biggest stakeholder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $214 million stake in the company.Taiwan Economic Daily recently reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has increased its orders for advanced packaging to fulfill orders of processors that are especially made for artificial intelligenceArtisan Focus Fund made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Accelerated card sales are expected to grow from $5.2B to ~$50B in 2026. Just last year this $50B was expected to be $15B-$17B, signifying the massive inflection at hand. We believe this step function in demand almost entirely accrues to Nvidia, one of our winners in Q1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently does not have an AI-specific accelerated card but should be in the market by the end of the year, making it also compelling. Regardless, Nvidia’s software is the only game in town, and we believe it will ultimately be layered on top of AMD or any other cards that come up. We are early in this process and believe we have sized this market more accurately than other research providers, giving us an advantage in executing and generating alpha in this area over the coming years. Downstream, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is also an important holding for us and one of only three companies that is currently able to manufacture these accelerated cards at scale. Among the three, Taiwan Semiconductor is the most advanced. As seen below, the mix shift in compute spending in the accelerated format represents a massive TAM shift.”10. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the best big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is seen as a potential AI play as the company released several AI features for its CRM platform earlier this year.Investment firm Baird recently said Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s Dreamforce conference was a positive for the company as it had a huge focus on AI.A total of 122 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The most significant stakeholder of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $1.1 billion stake in the company.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”9. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is showing massive insider selling activity, including selling from CEO Tim Cook. However, the latest weakness in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be the perfect entry point for long-term investors. Bank of America recently highlighted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s app store revenue in the third quarter jumped about 8.6% year over year.  Evercore ISI recently said in a report that the demand for iPhone 15 Pro remains strong everywhere except China and Japan.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 135 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The most significant stakeholder of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $178 billion stake in the company.Choice Equities Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 139Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) ranks 8th in our list of the best big company stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently said the report from the Wall Street Journal saying the company is mulling to hike credit card fees is wrong.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 139 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). The most significant stakeholder of MA during this period was Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management which owns a $2.31 billion stake in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is enjoying massive consumer spending on travel. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its latest earnings call talked about travel spending patterns and its guidance:“Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.Baron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We modestly trimmed Visa Inc., Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Accenture plc to manage the position sizes and raise capital to fund purchases elsewhere. These stocks remain full-sized positions and high-conviction ideas in the Fund.Another fintech industry trend we’re seeing is a pickup in M&amp;A activity, most notably in the payments sector. The year started with Nuvei’s $1.3 billion acquisition of Paya announced in January. In April, Network International received an initial takeover offer from a group of private equity firms, which was then topped by Brookfield Asset Management whose $2.8 billion offer was accepted by the Board in June. Following reports earlier this year of a bidding war between Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated to acquire cloud-based issuer processor and core banking software provider Pismo.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is one of the top big company stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has been ruthlessly cutting costs in a bid to focus on profits and controlled growth. Those efforts are showing results. For the first time in history, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) posted an operating profit earlier this year when it posted results for the second quarter of 2023.  Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s net income in the period came in at $394 million, up $1.0 billion on a year-over-year basis.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 144 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s CEO talked about Uber’s future plans, using of AI and machine learning and cost discipline in Q2 earnings call:""Travel is a very important ecosystem for us, both in terms of pickups and drop-offs, and we have a very significant audience of international travelers and U.K. travelers. And we said, “Hey, why can’t we go after this tour operator market?” And essentially, we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators with what I will call the Uber Delight. We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we’re a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I’m going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there.And what we’re seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time. So, when we know it’s your morning commute on a Tuesday morning, we don’t offer you the Eurostar, but when we think that you might be open to new and different ways of using the Uber, and we want to be your kind of the operating system for everyday life, not just for you to go to work, but to be that travel companion as well, we will extend those services, offer those services. We’ve now expanded into flights as well. And we’re actually seeing engagement with users being higher than we thought, and we’re not seeing cannibalization of the base business. So, we’re quite hopeful of that business. And again, that tour operator market in the U.K. is a very, very large market that we can go after.""Read the full earnings call transcript here.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor for the quarter following better than expected 1Q23 earnings and 2Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $31.4 billion were up 22% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $15 billion grew 44% over the last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings, also $15 billion, were up 12% from last year and accelerated through the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $761 million, up $593 million year over year, significantly beat management’s $660-$700 million guidance and the company generated $549 million of free cash flow versus a loss last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 2Q Gross Bookings (13%-17% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $800- $850 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.4 billion in Freight revenue for 1Q23), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $84 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”6. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 171Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is one of those companies that continue to remain strong even during volatile times due to the “essential” nature of the services they provide.

58,81996be7-2bb4-34bb-9cbd-f857891e94d3,APH,2023-10-15,Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporation-nyse-aph-stock-140015205.html,1697292015,STORY,['APH'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Amphenol's (NYSE:APH) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.3% over the past month. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Amphenol's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Amphenol How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:25% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Amphenol's Earnings Growth And 25% ROETo begin with, Amphenol has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Amphenol's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Amphenol's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 16% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Amphenol's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Amphenol Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 25% (implying that the company retains 75% of its profits), it seems that Amphenol is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Amphenol has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 28%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Amphenol's future ROE will be 23% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Amphenol's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Amid the boom in artificial intelligence, its high-powered chips are clamored over by the likes of Amazon, Meta, and Google.Yet while those companies and many others have issued return-to-office mandates, Nvidia, which has about 26,000 employees worldwide and a valuation of over $1 trillion, is bucking the trend and putting no pressure on remote workers to commute to cubicles.In May 2020, Huang said he had “no trouble with” letting employees work out of the their home indefinitely. “There’s no question we’re going to do this,” he told VentureBeat at the time.Today the California-based company is sticking with the policy while also offering employees luxurious office spaces (see below) in which to gather and collaborate. Nvidia leaves it up to workers whether they work at home, in a cafe, or in the office. It views the arrangement “as a way for employees to balance their personal and work obligations, while preparing for the future, so they can focus on doing their life’s work,” Beau Davidson, vice president of employee experience, told Commercial Observer.Employees inside the Voyager building at Nvidia headquarters in Santa Clara, California, US, on Monday, June 5, 2023. Nvidia Corp., suddenly at the core of the world's most important technology, owns 80% of the market for a particular kind of chip called a data-center accelerator, and the current wait time for one of its AI processors is eight months. Photographer: Marlena Sloss/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesIn contrast, other companies have grown increasingly strident about employees working more in the office. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently warned employees that “it’s probably not going to work out for you” if they continued to ignore a return-to-office mandate. That followed an earlier employee walkout protesting the policy, where one worker leading the charge insisted, “We can be productive, customer obsessed, we can do our good work, we can make a difference, and it does not have to be in an office building.”Nvidia’s Huang would seem to agree with that sentiment. However employees prefer to mix their work settings, “I’m perfectly comfortable with all that,"" he told VentureBeat.Unlike other CEOs, however, he’s sticking with the policy. A few years ago, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted, “We are going to be the most forward-leaning company on remote work at our scale, with a thoughtful and responsible plan for how to do this.” He estimated that about half of the company’s employees would be working remotely within the next five to 10 years. Fast-forward to today and his employees must be back in the office three days a week, with their presence tracked by card keys and other tools. Those failing to comply risk being fired or taking a hit on performance reviews.Story continuesYet Meta workers returning to the office have reportedly struggled to book conference rooms or even find a desk that they can use for a full day. Adam Mosseri, head of Meta’s Instagram, wrote on Threads, “We have not yet figured out hybrid work.” Meanwhile Zuckerberg touted cutting-edge metaverse headsets, saying on the Lex Fridman Podcast, “I think this gets us a lot closer to being able to work physically in different places...I think we’re not there today with just video conferencing and the basic technologies that we have.”Other firms are resorting to preferential treatment to get employees back in the office. Of more than 400 U.S. CEOs surveyed by KPMG, 90% said they would reward those who work in person with favorable assignments, raises, and promotions.But Rob Sadow, CEO of Scoop Technologies, maker of a hybrid-office productivity app, believes many company leaders are clinging to the past. “Sometimes that desire to return to office comes more out of fear and desire to repeat past experience than it is around optimizing for what the future is going to look like,” he told the Observer.Another company bucking the return-to-office trend is the software giant Atlassian, which makes collaboration tools such as Jira.“We expect people to be able to work from home, from a café, from an office, but we don’t really care where they do their work—what we care about is the output that they produce,” co-CEO Scott Farquhar told Australia’s 60 Minutes program in August, adding, “I might come into the office about once a quarter.”The company still has ambitious plans for new offices, including in Seattle and Sydney, where it’s broken ground on a 40-story headquarters featuring lush interiors and spaces designed with employee gatherings in mind. It now evaluates its real estate strategy not by card swipes, but with metrics such as cost per visit and the degree to which employees utilize an office and engage within it.Similarly, Nvidia’s latest headquarters addition, an airy, jaw-dropping 750,000-square-foot structure dubbed Voyager (see above), rejects boxy structures, emphasizing instead communal spaces and views for everyone.Sadow believes that by letting workers choose between working remotely or collaborating in cutting-edge office space, Nvidia gains a “pretty meaningful talent advantage.”Indeed that advantage could help it attract employees alienated by harsh return-to-office mandates elsewhere. In a recent survey by Deloitte and Workplace Intelligence, two-third of executives said they’d likely quit if forced back to the office five days a week. The report warned that companies forcing employees back to cubicles “run the risk of losing their pipeline of leaders and have difficulty recruiting fresh talent.”That’s one risk Nvidia, it would appear, doesn’t need to worry about too much.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 33% in three years, versus a market return of about 21%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Walt Disney moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. So it's worth looking at other metrics to try to understand the share price move.We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 13% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth investigating Walt Disney further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Walt Disney better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) share price managed to fall 64% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 13% in the last three months.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for Under Armour To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Under Armour moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 2.6% a year in the five year period.

Unfortunately, longer term shareholders are suffering worse, given the loss of 10% doled out over the last five years.

(NYSE:PRU) share price is up 42% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 15% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 4.5% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Prudential Financial became profitable within the last three years. So we would expect a higher share price over the period.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Prudential Financial has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Prudential Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 64%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePrudential Financial provided a TSR of 4.5% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 4% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100.Global markets have started to see the real effects of rising interest rates. Consumer spending is expected to decline in the coming weeks and months as inflation remains elevated, mainly due to a sharp rise in energy prices. According to an October report from Merrill, which quotes, EIA’s data, Brent oil in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to average at around $93 per barrel.Merrill also said that the era of easy money might be over and the coming days and weeks will show how companies and individuals deal with this reality. The report said:“Borrowers (both public and private) will need to deal with the repercussions of almost 15 years of near-zero interest rate policies, which drove a significant increase in aggregate debt levels across public and private markets. This has several important implications, particularly for lower-quality, high-yield and loan issuers, where debt-service burdens are higher relative to earnings, and defaults are already on the rise. For Investment-grade (IG) investors, the answer is more nuanced. While debt growth in the IG corporate market has led to a notable deterioration in credit quality over time, this is a well understood trend, and we expect that most IG issuers will face just minor challenges should rates indeed stay higher for longer. Furthermore, in the longer term, higher debt costs could lead to more conservatism on behalf of management teams with regard to balance sheet leverage and management. A bigger potential longer-term worry, however, could be growing U.S. government debt as issuance needs remain elevated given rising deficits. This is a key risk factor that we see supporting the higher-for-longer view on yields and will be something to watch closely over the next several quarters.”Some analysts were expecting the Fed to start rate cuts in 2024 but the latest jobs report might have dampened those hopes. RBC Wealth Management in a September report had said that the Federal Reserve could start to cut rates if weak economic data comes especially on the employment front. That hope was crushed on October 6 when the latest report showed US labor market remains strong. The RBC report however said that 2024 will be difficult for the stock market as the firm expects recession and market slowdown during the year. While the firm still recommends investors to pile into stocks for the long term, it said investors should only buy those individual stocks which can do well during recessions and inflation. RBC said while the jury is still out on whether we are headed for hard or soft landing, it does expect recession to hit the US stock market soon. Among the biggest reasons behind this rationale is rising interest rates and drying US household savings, which were built up during the pandemic era.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks Under $100Photo by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 blue chip stocks trading under $100 with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy.

While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”10. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) ranks 10th in our list of the best blue chip stocks under $100 to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). The biggest stake in Citigroup Inc.

(NYSE:C) is getting ready for a major restructuring that would include reassignments, retraining and layoffs of employees.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy made the following comment about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We’ve recently been adding to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years. Meanwhile, you collect the 4.5% annual dividend, which is currently a better yield than long-term treasuries.9. Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Cloud applications security and monitoring platform company Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) ranks 9th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100 according to hedge funds.  Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) is a potential AI play as AI applications based on Cloud see an exponential increase. Earlier this month, Piper Sandler upgraded Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) adding that the company is showing ""signs of stability"" as well as a boost from artificial intelligence.Pipe Sandler’s analyst Rob Owens upped his rating for the stock to Overweight from Neutral and gave a $115 price target.""We favor the disruptive nature of the company's solutions, think its platform play will continue to resonate and believe its best days are still ahead,” Owens said.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”8. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Natural resources company Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) shares have gained about 24% over the past one year. Analysts believe Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a buy on expectations that the company would be acquired in part or full by Glencore. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is also a solid copper play. Copper is seeing a rising demand in the world amid electrification.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 79 hedge funds had stakes in Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK). The biggest stakeholder of Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which owns a $424 million stake in the company.7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained about 37% year to date. For the fiscal first quarter, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) expects sales to be between $4.2 billion and $4.6 billion. MU ranks x in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100.Here’s what Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) said about its Q1 guidance in its latest earnings call:“We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points. And operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry’s most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND. Micron’s leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.As of the end of the second quarter of 223, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). The biggest stakeholder of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $425 million stake in the company.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares were owned by 86 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) during this period was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $381 million stake in the company.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares saw a ratings cut from  MoffettNathanson as the firm expects PayPal to face tough competition from Apple Pay and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)'s Cash App.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL): PayPal shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite reporting better than anticipated 1Q earnings and raising guidance for the remainder of 2023. Revenue of $7 billion grew 9% year over year, an acceleration from the prior year and quarter. EPS of 1.17 grew 33% year over year on better cost discipline leading to better operating margins. The disappointment was centered around weaker gross margins, as unbranded checkout, which has lower gross margins, accelerated faster than branded checkout. Management anticipates this trend to continue and therefore guided to lower gross margins for the remainder of the year. Despite the gross margin headwind, operating margins continue to expand due to expense discipline.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet – providing the purest exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 1Q non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel at least a high teens earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None. 13 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology What Is Micron Technology's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of August 2023, Micron Technology had US$12.0b of debt, up from US$6.02b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$9.59b in cash, and so its net debt is US$2.46b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Micron Technology's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Micron Technology had liabilities of US$4.77b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$15.4b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$9.59b in cash and US$2.44b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$8.10b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Micron Technology has a humongous market capitalization of US$76.0b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Micron Technology can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesIn the last year Micron Technology had a loss before interest and tax, and actually shrunk its revenue by 50%, to US$16b. That makes us nervous, to say the least.Caveat EmptorWhile Micron Technology's falling revenue is about as heartwarming as a wet blanket, arguably its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss is even less appealing. To be specific the EBIT loss came in at US$5.5b. When we look at that and recall the liabilities on its balance sheet, relative to cash, it seems unwise to us for the company to have any debt. So we think its balance sheet is a little strained, though not beyond repair. However, it doesn't help that it burned through US$6.1b of cash over the last year. So in short it's a really risky stock. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Micron Technology .If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade.

Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.8% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 8% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that McDonald's has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think McDonald's will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of McDonald's, it has a TSR of 66% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 53% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 2.4% losses, last week’s 4.8% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Occidental Petroleum. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Occidental Petroleum already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Occidental Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Occidental Petroleum. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 25% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 6.8% of the stock.Story continuesOn looking further, we found that 52% of the shares are owned by the top 5 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$157m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in Occidental Petroleum. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 25% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100.Global markets have started to see the real effects of rising interest rates. Consumer spending is expected to decline in the coming weeks and months as inflation remains elevated, mainly due to a sharp rise in energy prices. According to an October report from Merrill, which quotes, EIA’s data, Brent oil in the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to average at around $93 per barrel.Merrill also said that the era of easy money might be over and the coming days and weeks will show how companies and individuals deal with this reality. The report said:“Borrowers (both public and private) will need to deal with the repercussions of almost 15 years of near-zero interest rate policies, which drove a significant increase in aggregate debt levels across public and private markets. This has several important implications, particularly for lower-quality, high-yield and loan issuers, where debt-service burdens are higher relative to earnings, and defaults are already on the rise. For Investment-grade (IG) investors, the answer is more nuanced. While debt growth in the IG corporate market has led to a notable deterioration in credit quality over time, this is a well understood trend, and we expect that most IG issuers will face just minor challenges should rates indeed stay higher for longer. Furthermore, in the longer term, higher debt costs could lead to more conservatism on behalf of management teams with regard to balance sheet leverage and management. A bigger potential longer-term worry, however, could be growing U.S. government debt as issuance needs remain elevated given rising deficits. This is a key risk factor that we see supporting the higher-for-longer view on yields and will be something to watch closely over the next several quarters.”Some analysts were expecting the Fed to start rate cuts in 2024 but the latest jobs report might have dampened those hopes. RBC Wealth Management in a September report had said that the Federal Reserve could start to cut rates if weak economic data comes especially on the employment front. That hope was crushed on October 6 when the latest report showed US labor market remains strong. The RBC report however said that 2024 will be difficult for the stock market as the firm expects recession and market slowdown during the year. While the firm still recommends investors to pile into stocks for the long term, it said investors should only buy those individual stocks which can do well during recessions and inflation. RBC said while the jury is still out on whether we are headed for hard or soft landing, it does expect recession to hit the US stock market soon. Among the biggest reasons behind this rationale is rising interest rates and drying US household savings, which were built up during the pandemic era.Story continuesBest Blue Chip Stocks Under $100Photo by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds and picked 13 blue chip stocks trading under $100 with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy.

Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) ranks 11th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100 according to hedge funds.

While it would appear that a crisis was avoided by the quick intervention of bank regulators in the US and Switzerland, some uneasiness still remains in the global banking community. This turmoil couldn’t help but have a negative impact on investor sentiment and in turn on Fund bank holdings such as Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).”10. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) ranks 10th in our list of the best blue chip stocks under $100 to buy according to hedge funds.

(NYSE:C) is getting ready for a major restructuring that would include reassignments, retraining and layoffs of employees.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy made the following comment about Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We’ve recently been adding to Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). After perennially disappointing for decades, even the most bullish financial investors aren’t interested (a good thing in our view!). CEO Jane Fraser is making all the right moves: exiting underperforming consumer businesses, investing to improve the tech and operating infrastructure, returning capital to shareholders. These actions should result in improving returns on equity. The market reaction is a giant shrug.We should start to see serious cost improvements in late 2024 accompanied by improving returns on equity. The stock trades at ~$46, 55% of its $85 tangible book value. The company is confident it can reach 11-12% return on tangible common equity by 2025 when it’s tangible book should be greater than $100. If it reaches its return target, as we believe, Citi should trade back to tangible book, implying a more than double over the next couple years. Meanwhile, you collect the 4.5% annual dividend, which is currently a better yield than long-term treasuries.9. Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Cloud applications security and monitoring platform company Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) ranks 9th in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy under $100 according to hedge funds.  Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) is a potential AI play as AI applications based on Cloud see an exponential increase. Earlier this month, Piper Sandler upgraded Datadog, Inc. (NYSE:DDOG) adding that the company is showing ""signs of stability"" as well as a boost from artificial intelligence.Pipe Sandler’s analyst Rob Owens upped his rating for the stock to Overweight from Neutral and gave a $115 price target.""We favor the disruptive nature of the company's solutions, think its platform play will continue to resonate and believe its best days are still ahead,” Owens said.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”8. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 79Natural resources company Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) shares have gained about 24% over the past one year. Analysts believe Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a buy on expectations that the company would be acquired in part or full by Glencore.

Copper is seeing a rising demand in the world amid electrification.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 79 hedge funds had stakes in Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK). The biggest stakeholder of Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) was Eric W. Mandelblatt’s Soroban Capital Partners which owns a $424 million stake in the company.7. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have gained about 37% year to date. For the fiscal first quarter, Micron Technology, Inc.

We expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry’s most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND. Micron’s leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing.”Read the full earnings call transcript here.As of the end of the second quarter of 223, 86 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). The biggest stakeholder of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) during this period was Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $425 million stake in the company.Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”6. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares were owned by 86 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) during this period was John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $381 million stake in the company.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares saw a ratings cut from  MoffettNathanson as the firm expects PayPal to face tough competition from Apple Pay and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)'s Cash App.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL): PayPal shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite reporting better than anticipated 1Q earnings and raising guidance for the remainder of 2023. Revenue of $7 billion grew 9% year over year, an acceleration from the prior year and quarter. EPS of 1.17 grew 33% year over year on better cost discipline leading to better operating margins. The disappointment was centered around weaker gross margins, as unbranded checkout, which has lower gross margins, accelerated faster than branded checkout. Management anticipates this trend to continue and therefore guided to lower gross margins for the remainder of the year. Despite the gross margin headwind, operating margins continue to expand due to expense discipline.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet – providing the purest exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 1Q non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel at least a high teens earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100. Suggested articles:12 Best Upwork Alternatives for Freelancers and EmployersTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the World23 High-Paying Trade and Vocational Jobs in 2023Disclosure: None. 13 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
84,839f2bde-78e1-3f52-ae2c-f55489d55863,BSX,2023-10-15,Be Wary Of Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) And Its Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wary-boston-scientific-nyse-bsx-110042518.html,1697367642,STORY,['BSX'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boston Scientific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.077 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$34b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.7%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.7%. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Boston Scientific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Boston Scientific's ROCE Trending?In terms of Boston Scientific's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 11%, but since then they've fallen to 7.7%. However it looks like Boston Scientific might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesOn a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 14% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.In Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that Boston Scientific is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And with the stock having returned a mere 36% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.On a final note, we've found   3 warning signs for Boston Scientific  that we think you should be aware of.While Boston Scientific isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

However, supportive tax laws and a friendly regulatory environment are also factors to determine when considering to form a limited liability company. With that, let's look at the 1o best states to start an LLC.10 Best States to Start an LLC10 Best States to Start an LLCOur MethodologyFor our title, 10 best states to start an LLC, we based our ranking on the state-wise business tax climate score by the Tax Foundation and the state-wise cumulative 10-year job growth rate between 2012 and 2022 by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Our primary metric was the state-wise business tax climate score, supported by our secondary metric, the cumulative 10-year job growth rate.We included these two metrics to depict the state-wise economic outlook to our readers accurately. For business owners, a state's economic conditions are crucial to a business's success. Additionally, our list consists of states that tax LLCs as pass-through entities, meaning that no federal or state taxes are levied directly on the entity. However, LLC members or owners pay a certain income tax on the earnings from the LLC. The business climate index accurately represents the different types of taxes that may impact an LLC member. The score comprises income tax, sales tax, corporate tax, property tax, and unemployment insurance tax. The business tax climate score is calculated across the five tax categories to reach a cumulated score, with 1 being the lowest and 1o being the highest.We sifted through the business tax climate score to identify and shortlist our top 20 states. We picked the top 10 with the highest cumulative growth rate. We also mentioned the formation costs for an LLC in each of the states listed below to make the list more comprehensive and well-rounded. The list is in ascending order of the business tax climate score, primarily, and cumulative 10-year job growth rates, secondarily.It is important to note that starting an LLC in your home state will save you tremendous costs as you only have to register your LLC once. However, if you plan to set up your LLC in another state, you must register it as a foreign LLC in your home state. Therefore, the reporting and filing costs will increase, as you will pay two LLC filing fees.10 Best States to Start an LLC10. VirginiaBusiness Tax Climate Score: 5.07Cumulative 10 Year Job Growth Rate: 15.3%According to our methodology, Virginia is among the best states to form a limited liability company with formation costs of $103.

LLC members in Virginia must pay the state income tax on their returns from the LLC along with a self employment tax.LegalZoom.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:LZ), Xero Limited (OTC:XROLF) and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) are some of the top companies offering bespoke services for small businesses and limited liability companies.9. OregonBusiness Tax Climate Score: 5.14Cumulative 10 Year Job Growth Rate: 19.7%Oregon is among the best states to start a limited liability company. Limited liability companies in Oregon are taxed as pass-through entities. LLC members must pay the federal income tax on their returns or individual profits from the LLC. The tax rate lies somewhere between 4.75% to 9.90% based on income. The formation costs of an LLC in Oregon amount to $100. The low filing fee makes Oregon an attractive option.8. ColoradoBusiness Tax Climate Score: 5.17Cumulative 10 Year Job Growth Rate: 28.3%According to our methodology, Colorado is one of the best states to form a limited liability company. The state boasts a business-friendly infrastructure and the formation costs only amount to $50. LLC members must pay the flat income tax rate of 4.63% on their earnings from the LLC. This tax policy prevents members from getting double-taxed.7. ArizonaBusiness Tax Climate Score: 5.26Cumulative 10 Year Job Growth Rate: 30.1%Arizona is one of the best states to start an LLC. The formation cost of a limited liability company in Arizona is only $50. Forming a limited liability company in Arizona is relatively easy and requires less paperwork.

LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockSemiconductors have been a cyclical industry in the past. However, according to PIMCO, they could become more secular due to their increasing ubiquity. Semiconductors have become prevalent in numerous applications such as industrial automation, autos, cloud computing, consumer devices, 5G infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Given these trends, this global leader in wafer fabrication equipment and services is one of the top stock predictions for 2024.With 14 global locations, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a key equipment supplier for the semiconductor industry. Throughout the past year, the sector has had a cyclical downturn due to weaker demand and a semi supply glut. However, analysts think the downturn has bottomed and 2024 could be a recovery year.Buying LRCX stock here could lead to solid gains if the industry recovers in 2024. Besides, the company has another catalyst. The advances in artificial intelligence are creating opportunities for the company. Advanced AI servers contain higher leading-edge logic, storage and memory content.This means more demand for wafer front-end equipment (WFE). Analysts estimate that an incremental 1% penetration of AI servers in data centers will add $1 to $1.5 billion of additional WFE demand. Furthermore, the semiconductor equipment giant has strengthened its position in packaging. The company revealed more than 50 market shares in deposition and etch solutions in the latest quarterly report.The AI tailwind bodes well for the stock. Recently, Wolfe Research initiated coverage with a “buy” rating. Their price target of $825 presents more than 30% upside as of this writing. Other analysts are also bullish, setting the LRCX stock for solid performance throughout the next year.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

90,e01a3733-9ab2-392a-8177-83fb9065015a,SRE,2023-10-15,Q4 Stock Predictions: 3 Utility Stocks Ready to Roar Into 2024,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q4-stock-predictions-3-utility-120651887.html,1696853211,STORY,"['EIX', 'SRE', 'AWK']","[Investors really should take a hard look at utilities stocks at the moment. Their prices are falling because bond yields are very high. It’s all about income. Bonds provide risk-free income for investors willing to park their money for a given time frame. Utility stocks are normally one of the go-to equity sectors for income seekers. They pay healthy dividends that are very reliable. However, they’re not as reliable as bonds and with yields approaching 5% utilities stocks have begun to pale. As a result, they’ve become cheaper which should draw the interest of investors willing to take a slight amount of risk. That’s right, utilities stocks are now riskier than they’ve been in some time. Risk equals reward but these companies aren’t risky in the general sense of the word. So here are the best utility stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Water Works (AWK) Flooded quarry for limestone mining. Turquoise water. White beaches. Water stocks.Source: Klintsou Ihar / Shutterstock.comAmerican Water Works (NYSE:AWK) is cheaper than it has been since the stock last traded below $120 in 2019. With the exception of the onset of the pandemic, it hasn’t been cheaper since then. The utility company provides water and wastewater services to 14 states and 18 military installations. It’s essentially a water utility but also provides long-term contracted services on U.S. military bases. Aside from its current price, there are other reasons to be interested in American Water Works. There’s a clear opportunity in water in general as an asset for investment. Water scarcity is a real issue and that simply bodes well for the firm in general. Beyond those factors, there’s a solid fundamental case for AWK stock. Revenues increased by 14.4% during the first half of 2023 and earnings jumped as a consequence. AWK shares include a dividend. It isn’t substantial with a forward yield of 2.3% but it is reliable and when investors realize how much the shares are undervalued the extra 2.3% return really looks attractive. Story continuesSempra (SRE) A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comSempra (NYSE:SRE) does include a higher-yielding dividend at 3.67% currently. That’s a higher percentage enticement than a lot of utility stocks pay and underscores one of the best reasons to consider the San Diego area public firm. Sempra’s dividend is reliable, having last been reduced in 2000. Let’s run through some quick math here to give an idea about the potential of SRE shares. It trades at $64 and carries an average target price of $84. Annual dividends amount to $2.40. Thus, we’re talking about 35% expected upside as a ballpark figure over the next year. Assume things get worse economically. That should make utilities firms like Sempra more appealing to investors. Assume the opposite and that Sempra’s price remains flat. Returns would then be 3.67% from dividends alone. In that case, just hold longer because utilities are like small monopolies that simply move up over time. Remember, though, that’s not the base case scenario. Edison International (EIX)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockIt’s relatively easy to calculate similar returns for Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stock. I won’t bore you with the calculations, instead, I’ll just give you the number: 25%. That makes Edison International less attractive than Sempra but attractive nonetheless. The best utilities have provided far lower returns than 25% on an annualized basis over the past decade. Even a 20% return over a year would be quite exceptional. That’s exactly what the sector is offering this year. It will remain among the most reliable this year, next year, and beyond. Edison International generates and distributes electricity. That means it’s part energy company and part utility company. Many utility firms simply provide the infrastructure through which energy is delivered. Edison produces the energy and sends it to consumers and businesses. The company looks safe. Edison International reaffirmed earnings guidance in late July and expects its earnings to grow by between 5-7% through 2028. That should translate to steady price appreciation in its shares that will help its price to rebound to levels that Wall Street expects. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

91,d9e6ccf0-a8e1-33b0-a3af-4ea08d6a8fb9,AAL,2023-10-15,15 Most Popular Sparkling Wine Brands in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-popular-sparkling-wine-033225961.html,1697340745,STORY,"['AAL', 'MC.PA']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 most popular sparkling wine brands in America. You can skip our detailed analysis of the American sparkling wine market, the premiumization in sparkling wine, the most popular Champagne brand in America, and sparkling wine in the air, and go directly to 5 Most Popular Sparkling Wine Brands in America. As the 19th century dawned, Cincinnati lawyer and temperance movement supporter Nicholas Longworth was looking for a lighter alternative to whiskey, which at the time, was the popular alternative to water. He began making wines from the Catawba grape – a hybrid grape created by crossing American Labrusca grapes with the European Vitis vinifera vines traditionally used to make Old World wines. Now it is hard to imagine sparkling Catawba, but this sweet, zingy wine was actually America's first sparkler and, for many years, one of the country's best wines and the flagship wine of Ohio, which became the biggest wine-producing state in the country by 1859. However, 1860 turned out to be a grim year and the state’s wine industry collapsed due to disease and sparkling Catawba eventually faded with time, but Longworth is remembered as an important figure in the history of American wine and sparkling wine in particular.American Sparkling Wine Market: Americans have long had a strong love affair with sparkling wines. The U.S. is the world’s largest market for sparkling wine by value, and the third-largest by volume. 2021 turned out to be a great year with the American sparkling wine industry witnessing double digit growth, mainly due to the pent-up demand to celebrate weddings, holiday gatherings, and other personal milestones after the restrictions of the pandemic. According to a recent report by IWSR, sparkling wine was the only wine segment in the U.S. to achieve large volume growth between 2016 and 2021. Between 2021 to 2026, the American sparkling wine market is projected to grow by more than 15% in volume, while in value terms, the U.S. is expected to account for nearly 15% of the entire global sparkling wine sales by 2026. The major factor contributing to this long-term growth is that the pool of sparkling wine drinkers has jumped sharply since 2019 – 30% to be precise. Story continuesPremiumization in Sparkling Wine: Although sparkling wines are rapidly widening their appeal in the United States and attracting more and more consumers, this has not compromised the trend towards premiumization. Consumers are now spending significantly more per bottle for most sparkling wine types compared to previous years, and almost all brands have witnessed volume growth over the last decade. An important tailwind for the prospects of the American sparkling wine market is that all its offerings are being viewed as better value for money than in previous years.Most Popular Champagne Brand in America: With over 33.7 million bottles of bubbly imported from France last year, the United States ranks among the Countries that Drink the Most Champagne. Champagne’s brand leaders in the U.S. posted sterling performances across the board in 2021, with the top 20 labels combining for 25% growth to 1.8 million cases. Veuve Clicquot is the Best-Selling Champagne Brand in U.S.A., with 645,000 9-liter cases sold in the U.S. in 2021. Owned by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY), Veuve Clicquot has been around for more than two centuries, and its history and quality have made it one of the most sought after Champagnes in the world.Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY), through its various houses, is the largest producer of Champagne in the world. The consolidé MHCS boasted an annual revenue of over $2.2 billion in 2022. Commonly referred to as LVMH or Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY) is a French luxury conglomerate formed after the $4 billion merger of the renowned fashion house Louis Vuitton and wines and spirits company Moët Hennessy in 1987. Sparkling Wine in the Air: On most long-haul flights, business class passengers expect to be served a frosty glass of Champagne. Many airlines go the extra mile to make sure their customers are pampered and serve impressive brands like Dom Pérignon and Laurent Perrier. However, the Covid-19 pandemic brought the airline industry to its knees, forcing a multitude of carriers to adopt various cost-cutting measures in order to survive. The pandemic has come and gone, but the cost-cutting mindset seems to have remained. The American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has recently announced that it is no longer serving Champagne in Flagship Business – the carrier’s long haul business class product – as part of efforts by the group’s CEO Robert Isom to cut costs. Instead, the company’s new standard option is a cheaper Ferrari Brut Trento DOC, an Italian sparkling wine.Most passengers of the American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) may not mind the switch, but the company is part of the Oneworld Alliance, with many of its partner airlines making food service a key focus of their flight experience. The difference in luxuries that passengers experience when boarding one of these airlines as part of a connecting flight can potentially irk them.However, the stringent cost-cutting measures seem to bearing fruit for the company, and although the American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) has suffered from over-expenditure and losses as a result of it in the past, the carrier witnessed a net profit of $127 million last year, with a revenue of $48.97 billion. In fact, the American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) ranks among the 11 Best Airline Stocks to Invest in Right Now. With that said, here are the Most Popular Sparkling Wines in the U.S.15 Most Popular Sparkling Wine Brands in AmericaPublic Domain/PixabayMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Wine Handbook 2022 by the Beverage Information Group, looking for the Best-Selling Sparkling Wine Brands in America. The following wines have been ranked by their number of 9-liter cases sold in the U.S. in 2021. If you’re still at the dawn of your journey into the alluring world of vino, here are the Best Red Wines for Beginners and Casual Drinking.  15. Domaine Chandon9-Liter Cases Sold in 2021: 0.52 millionDomaine Chandon is one of Napa Valley’s most iconic and well-visited wineries, and one of only four wineries in the valley that focus on sparkling wine production. The brand’s signature style is brought to life through its award-winning sparkling wines which epitomize the brightness and vibrancy of California's terroir. 14. Martini and Rossi Asti9-Liter Cases Sold in 2021: 0.54 millionOwned by Bacardi, Martini &amp; Rossi Asti is a fruity sparkling wine made from the finest Moscato Bianco grapes grown in the heart of the prestigious Italian D.O.C.G. area.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Freeport-McMoRan, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$5.5b ÷ (US$51b - US$4.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Freeport-McMoRan has an ROCE of 12%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Metals and Mining industry average of 10%. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan roceIn the above chart we have measured Freeport-McMoRan's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Freeport-McMoRan here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Freeport-McMoRan doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 12% from 17% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Freeport-McMoRan's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 213% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Freeport-McMoRan and understanding them should be part of your investment process.While Freeport-McMoRan isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?
