They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexFNDA is managed by Charles Schwab, and this fund has amassed over $6 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Value. FNDA seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index before fees and expenses.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for FNDA are 0.25%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.Story continuesIt's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.57%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Representing 20.70% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Visteon Corp (VC) accounts for about 0.44% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ssc Government Mm Gvmxx (GVMXX) and Sylvamo Corp (SLVM).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF return is roughly 0.71% so far, and is down about -6.13% over the last 12 months (as of 05/31/2023). FNDA has traded between $42.52 and $53.63 in this past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.19 and standard deviation of 23.81% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1005 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $10.67 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $23.16 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.23% and VBR charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 7.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Viper Energy due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Viper Energy Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Fall Y/YViper Energy Partners reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per unit of 53 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. The bottom line increased from the year-ago quarter’s profit of 23 cents per share.The partnership, with mineral interests in North America oil and gas resources, generated an operating income of $169 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $161 million. The top line declined from the year-ago quarter’s $202 million.Viper Energy’s strong quarterly earnings were aided by higher oil-equivalent production volumes.ProductionThe resources, wherein the partnership has mineral interests, produced 3,147 thousand oil-equivalent barrels (MBoe) in the March-end quarter of 2023, up from 2,841 MBoe a year ago. Of the total volume, oil contributed 57.5%. The production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids increased from the prior-year quarter.Realized PricesThe overall average realized price per barrel of oil equivalent was $51.19 compared with $67.97 in first-quarter 2022. Average realized oil prices in the quarter under review were $75.48 per barrel, down from $94.95. The price of natural gas was $2.13 per thousand cubic feet, down from $4.07 in the year-ago quarter. The same for natural gas liquids was $24.45 a barrel, down from $38.99.Costs &amp; ExpensesIn first-quarter 2023, total expenses amounted to $46.6 million compared with $43.2 million in the prior-year quarter. On a per barrel of oil-equivalent (Boe) basis, total operating expenses were $4.86 compared with $5.47 in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesCash FlowNet cash provided by operating activities was $107.2 million, down from $135.8 million in the first quarter of 2022.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2023, Viper Energy’s cash and cash equivalents were $9.1 million. It reported net long-term debt of $695.2 million.GuidanceFor 2023, the partnership expects total production of 35.25-38.75 MBoe/d. For the second and third quarter, Viper Energy expects production of 36.25-38.75 MBoe/d.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Viper Energy has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Viper Energy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerViper Energy belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned -9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has lost 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.32 per share, indicating a change of -45% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +21.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -41%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.85 indicates a change of -30.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -23.8%. The $35.45 billion and $33.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.6% and -6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As such, we are making strategic investments to drive our multi-year brand-led growth in important areas such as marketing. We are well positioned to achieve double-digit EPS growth in 2023, while at the same time, we expect to generate significant cash flow.""Story continuesNon-GAAP Amounts:Amounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are defined or described in greater detail near the end of this release under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions."" Amounts stated on a constant currency basis also are deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented after the Non-GAAP Exclusions section and identify and quantify all excluded items.First Quarter Review:Revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period (increased 5% on a constant currency basis). The Company’s revenue growth was driven by solid performance in its international businesses, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, including 44% growth in local currency in China following the lifting of COVID restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2022, and continued growth in Europe in euros. The increase also reflected strong growth in the North America direct-to-consumer business.Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 8% compared to the prior year period (increased 12% on a constant currency basis), with strong growth in both the Company’s owned and operated stores and owned and operated digital commerce business.Wholesale revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior year period (increased 1% on a constant currency basis).Owned and operated digital commerce revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 8% on a constant currency basis). Total digital revenue decreased 3% compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). The strong growth in the Company’s owned and operated digital commerce business was more than offset by a decrease in wholesale sales to the Company’s wholesale.com and pure play customers. Digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 20%.Gross margin was 57.9% compared to 58.4% in the prior year period. The benefits from price increases, lower freight costs, and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix were more than offset by higher product costs, including an approximately 150 basis point negative impact on inventory costs due to foreign currency exchange rates.Inventory levels have decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, with improvement in all regions. Inventory was 24% higher than the prior year’s first quarter due to a combination of (i) abnormally low inventory levels in the prior year period, (ii) early receipts of inventory, and (iii) higher product costs.First Quarter Consolidated Results:Revenue increased 2% to $2.158 billion compared to the prior year period (increased 5% on a constant currency basis).Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year period (increased 8% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 3% (increased 7% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 11%Calvin Klein revenue was flat compared to the prior year period (increased 3% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein International revenue increased 7% (increased 11% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein North America revenue decreased 12%. Continued growth in the direct-to-consumer business was more than offset by a decrease in the wholesale business.Heritage Brands revenue decreased 12% compared to the prior year periodEarnings before interest and taxes (""EBIT"") was $199 million, inclusive of a $9 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $210 million in the prior year period. The revenue growth on a constant currency basis was offset by lower gross margins, including the approximately 150 basis point negative impact on inventory costs due to foreign currency exchange rates, discussed above. The Company continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives.Earnings per share (""EPS"") was $2.14, a 10% increase compared to $1.94 in the prior year period. EPS for the first quarter included the negative impact of $0.11 per share related to foreign currency translation.Interest expense of $22 million was flat as compared to the prior year period.Effective tax rate was 23.1% as compared to 29.4% in the prior year period.2023 Outlook:Full Year 2023 GuidanceRevenue is projected to increase 3% to 4% as compared to 2022 (increase 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis).Operating margin is projected to be approximately 10%.EPS is projected to be approximately $10.00 compared to $3.03 on a GAAP basis and $8.97 on a non-GAAP basis in 2022. The 2023 EPS projection includes the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.15 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for 2022 included the amounts described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis excluded these amounts.Interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $100 million compared to $83 million in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates.Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%.Second Quarter 2023 GuidanceRevenue is projected to increase low single-digits as compared to the second quarter of 2022.EPS is projected to be approximately $1.70 compared to $1.72 on a GAAP basis and $2.08 on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter 2023 EPS projection includes the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.05 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2022 included the amounts described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis excluded these amounts.Interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $25 million compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2022.Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 26%.Please see the section entitled ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section.Non-GAAP Exclusions:The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude the following:Pre-tax gain of $78 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans.Pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates.Pre-tax costs of $20 million incurred in 2022, consisting of severance related to initial actions under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, of which $17 million was incurred in the third quarter and $4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter.Pre-tax net costs of $43 million recorded in 2022 in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its Russia business, primarily consisting of noncash asset impairments and a gain on contract terminations, of which $50 million of charges were recorded in the second quarter and an $8 million gain was recorded in the fourth quarter.Pre-tax gain of $16 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V.Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.The Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and can have a significant impact on the Company’s reported revenues. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period).The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including constant currency revenue information, as a supplement to its GAAP results. The Company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of non-recurring and non-operational amounts and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, and (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding non-recurring and non-operational amounts are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.Please see the sections entitled ""Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue"" and ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.Conference Call Information:The Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter earnings release on Thursday, June 1, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

(viii) the availability and cost of raw materials; (ix) the Company’s ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations and the migration and development of manufacturers (which can affect where the Company’s products can best be produced);

Also, its inorganic growth moves support expansion into new geographic footprints. However, rising cost is likely to hinder bottom-line improvement. Also, lack of diversification in loan portfolio and legal hassles are likely to act as headwinds.U.S. Bancorp’s revenues witnessed a rising trend over the last few years and in first-quarter 2023. Revenues benefit from higher NII and USB’s efforts to enhance its range of products, services and capabilities. Management expects total revenues to reach $28.5-$30.5 billion in 2023.The company’s NII has been higher due to the rising interest rates and balance-sheet growth. USB’s loan and deposit balances have been rising over the years as it continues to expand and deepen relationships with current customers, acquire new ones and expand market share. For second-quarter and full-year 2023, management expects average earning assets in the range of $600-$605 billion and $600-$610 billion, respectively.U.S. Bancorp has opened new markets for itself and fortified existing markets through a number of strategic acquisitions in the past years.  In December 2022, it completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise to expand its branch network and have greater access to digital banking tools.USB has a strong balance sheet. At first quarter end, the company’s cash and due from banks of $67.23 billion exceeded its long-term debt of $42.05 billion, reflecting manageable debt levels. Also, given its strong liquidity and impressive earnings strength, its capital deployment activities seem sustainable and is likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock.However, rising costs remain a concern for U.S. Bancorp. Its non-interest expenses saw a positive compound annual growth rate over the last four years.  The increasing trend continued in first-quarter 2023 as well.Management estimates to incur total expenses of $1.4 billion for Union Bank integration. Further, it forecasts non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) of $17-$17.5 billion in 2023. Hence, USB’s cost base remains relatively high which is likely to hinder bottom-line growth.Apart from increasing costs, lack of diversification in loan portfolio amid an uncertain economy and legal hassles are likely to act as headwinds. Around 49.6% of USB’s loan portfolio comprises of commercial loans (commercial and commercial real estate lending) as of Mar 31. Further, U.S. Bancorp continues to encounter investigations and lawsuits from the investors and regulators, leading to increased legal expenses and provisions in the near term.Story continuesShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 32.4% compared with a decline of 14.6% recorded by its industry over the past six months..Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Bar Harbor Bankshares BHB and Pathward Financial Inc.

They identified the U.S.-headquartered companies who met the inclusion criteria that achieved the greatest reductions in their core emissions intensities - the measurement of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions as a factor of revenue - between 2019 and 2021.Cintas lowered the emissions intensity of its Scope 1 direct and Scope 2 indirect emissions from 113.1 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per million dollars of revenue (MTCO2e/$M) in fiscal year 2019, to 89.3 MTCO2e/$M in fiscal year 2021, which ended on May 31, 2021.In fiscal year 2022, Cintas lowered its emissions intensity by an additional 7.5% - to 82.6 MTCO2e/$M - to bring its four-year emissions intensity reduction to 27%. More information about Cintas' emissions performance and data methodologies is available in its 2022 ESG Report.""Rallying around our sustainability vision - A Shared Drive for Better - has been important for us and our business,"" said Todd Schneider, Cintas President and CEO. ""Our history of identifying opportunities and solutions through our culture of positive discontent has had a major impact on lowering our environmental impact.""We appreciate USA Today for recognizing Cintas as a Climate Leader in its inaugural program. We believe innovation and advances in technology will continue to be important drivers in our sustainability initiatives, especially as we identify opportunities to pursue sustainable programs and processes throughout our business,"" Schneider added.Enterprise-wide initiatives like an LED lighting conversion project and an ongoing dedication to Operational Excellence and Reliability initiatives have all helped contribute to the decrease in GHG emissions intensity.Story continuesOther more recent initiatives - including the rollout of its first electric fleet vehicles and its SmartTruck fleet routing optimization program - are expected to help contribute to ongoing emissions intensity reductions.In September 2021, Cintas announced its ambition to achieve Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050 and has continued to build out its enterprise-wide sustainability strategy.""We never stop challenging the status quo in everything we do to deliver A Shared Drive for Better,"" said Christy Nageleisen, Cintas Vice President of ESG. ""As we continue on our ESG Journey, and especially our Path to Net Zero, we will continue to embrace opportunities that elevate sustainable solutions. We've made significant progress during the last few years in identifying more efficient ways to operate, and we'll continue to evaluate every input and output as we focus on reducing our environmental impact, including our direct and indirect emissions.""The company's sustainable business model dates back to the Great Depression when out-of-work circus performers Doc and Amelia Farmer collected dirty, discarded shop rags and laundered them at home before selling them back to the same Cincinnati-area companies and creating a local circular economy for otherwise end-of-life products.As the family company continued to evolve, it continued to operate a reduce, reuse, repair, recycle program - first with rags and towels before expanding to other textiles and later rented workwear under Cintas Founder and Doc and Amelia's grandson, Dick Farmer.Learn More about Cintas' ESG JourneyCintas 2022 ESG Reportcintas.com/esgESG is Central to CintasThe Spirit is the DifferenceCintas Corporation Cintas Corporation helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing products and services that help keep their customers' facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF, Walmart Inc. WMT and The Kroger Co. KR.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Don't Lose Confidence: Scoop Up These 4 Retail Stocks, InsteadU.S. consumer confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — stumbled to a six-month low in May. Concerns related to a slowing economy, particularly the labor market, and the fear of a possible recession have hit consumers’ sentiments. Per the Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 102.3 in May from April’s upwardly revised reading of 103.7.A slump in consumers' confidence may have a direct impact on consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Also, the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, the demand has softened.Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director, Economics at The Conference Board, said, “Their assessment of current employment conditions saw the most significant deterioration, with the proportion of consumers reporting jobs are ‘plentiful’ falling 4 ppts from 47.5 percent in April to 43.5 percent in May. Consumers also became more downbeat about future business conditions, weighing on the expectations index.”That said, retailers such as Urban Outfitters, Inc., Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Walmart Inc. and The Kroger Co. have been focusing on a superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. They have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain.Story continuesWe have highlighted four stocks from the Retail-Wholesale sector that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

Yet, mounting operating expenses and the volatile nature of the investment banking (IB) business makes us apprehensive.RJF has successfully expanded its business in Europe and Canada through several opportunistic deals over the years. In the last fiscal year, the company acquired SumRidge Partners, TriState Capital Holdings and the U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. In fiscal 2021, it acquired Cebile Capital and a boutique investment bank, Financo. These and the past several buyouts continue to support its financials. Management is looking forward to many such acquisitions to strengthen its PCG and Asset Management segments.The PCG segment remains one of the best performers for the company. The net revenues for the segment have witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.9% over the last four fiscal years ended 2022. The uptrend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2023. We project the PCG segment’s revenues to increase 12.4%, 5.6% and 3.8% in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.However, RJF has continued to record a rise in non-interest expenses over the past several years. The metric has witnessed a CAGR of 12.2% over the past four fiscal years ended 2022. Steadily rising compensation costs and higher bank loan loss provisions have been primarily driving expenses. Although non-interest expenses declined marginally in the first six months of fiscal 2023. We project total non-interest expenses to rise 2.2%, 9% and 5.9% in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.The current geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties are likely to weigh on IB performance. During the six months ended Mar 31, 2023, RJF’s IB revenues witnessed a year-over-year decline of 55%. IB revenues are majorly dependent on the performance of the capital markets, which remain volatile. Thus, the company's over-dependence on IB revenues makes us apprehensive. We project the same to witness a decline of 35% in fiscal 2023.Story continuesFurther, analysts are bearish on the stock’s earnings prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Raymond James's current-year earnings has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past three months, shares of RJF have fallen 12% compared with the industry's 16% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBanks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc.

RYAN.Industry: Insurance BrokerageLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2102054/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-insurance-brokerage-industryBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Brown and Brown, Erie Indemnity and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services.Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside.Story continuesThe operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

President and CEO Mark J. Parrell noted limited new apartment supply in most of EQR's markets as well as high prices and the low availability of single-family homes as favorable factors for their outlook.Equity Residential raised its guidance for the same-store revenue change from the previous range of 4.5%-6% to the new range of 5.5%-6.25%. Its outlook for the same-store net operating income (NOI) change was also elevated from the range of 4.75%-6.25% to the new band of 6%-7%. However, EQR now expects its same-store physical occupancy to be 96.0%, down from its earlier guidance of 96.2%.Furthermore, EQR lifted its normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share projection to the $3.73-$3.83 band from its previous outlook in the range of $3.70-$3.80. The forecast for FFO per share saw an upward revision to the $3.69-$3.79 range from the earlier guided range of $3.66-$3.76. The revisions in FFO and normalized FFO per share are primarily attributed to a positive impact of 3 cents, mainly from an increase in same-store NOI.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Residential’s 2023 normalized FFO per share currently stands at $3.74. This calls for a 6.25% increase year over year.In the first quarter of 2023, Equity Residential reported a normalized FFO per share of 87 cents, which increased 13% year over year. Results reflected continued healthy demand and lower-than-anticipated bad debt. EQR also noted that it experienced better payment and move-out activity related to delinquent residents than assumed in its February 2023 guidance.ConclusionEquity Residential's updated 2023 earnings guidance is a positive indicator for potential investors. This upward revision, spurred by solid demand and decreased delinquency rates, underpins EQR's strong market position.The company's strategy of focusing on affluent urban areas seems to be yielding results, making it a compelling consideration for investors looking for stable returns in the residential property sector. As EQR navigates the market's dynamics, it will be interesting to see how these projections materialize and contribute to long-term growth and shareholder value.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have dropped 1.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s fall of 2.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Independence Realty Trust IRT and BRT Apartments Corp.

Real-time location and condition insights became more important than ever as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the e-commerce surge and consumer expectations around package visibility and on-time delivery skyrocketed.At the same time, a veritable technological revolution continued across the transportation industry. This focus on high-tech solutions to age-old problems has yielded a plethora of real-time visibility solutions for shippers to choose from.Despite the availability of solutions and the well-recognized importance of real-time visibility, however, many shippers still struggle to identify the best partners for them and their customers.Gartner’s Magic Quadrant stands out as one of the clearest – and most trusted – ways to evaluate the most popular real-time visibility options, providing shippers’ with a visual guide to their choices.“Real-time transportation visibility continues to be a key priority for shippers, logistic providers and their customers,” according to Gartner. “Supply chain technology leaders can use this research for an overview of current market trends and vendors in the real-time transportation visibility platform space.”Gartner’s MQ ranks companies on their ability to execute and the completeness of their product vision. Depending on their scores, players are classified into one of three four categories: nice players, visionaries, challengers or leaders.Image: GartnerCompanies classified as leaders are the highest ranked on both metrics, indicating a complete vision and the proven ability to execute it. Project44 has been classified as a leader on Gartner’s Magic Quadrant every year since the ranking product launched in 2021.“Leaders in the RTTVP market have broad, deep and differentiated functionality that addresses a broad range of user requirements,” according to Gartner. “Leaders listen to their customers; but, just as important, their customers look to them for thought leadership, and they establish symbiotic relationships.”Story continuesWhile p44 has been denoted as a leader for the past three years, this marks the first year that a single vendor has been positioned highest on ability to execute and furthest right on completeness of vision, surpassing its peers in both evaluated spheres.Gartner called out sales execution/pricing, marketing execution and market responsiveness as p44’s three greatest strengths. This was due, in large part, to the company’s standout revenue, superior brand recognition and continuous innovation efforts.“We’re constantly innovating to deliver the industry’s most comprehensive supply chain visibility solution – with a network of 230,000+ carriers tracking shipments across 180+ countries,” said Jett McCandless, founder and CEO of project44. ​“Solving supply chain’s persistent challenges requires unrelenting commitment, and we’re grateful for the support of our customers in executing this important vision.”Project44’s placement in this report comes on the heels of multiple recent product innovations to help customers better manage their supply chain, including in-terminal visibility, six other additions to their international visibility product suite, and two new self-service capabilities that enable e-commerce retailers to take control of the post-purchase customer experience.Project44’s dedication to its customers shines through in the company’s reviews. Project44 has the most overall reviews of any RTTVP vendor on Gartner Peer Insights, and 94% of customers are also willing to recommend project44, as of May 2023.“Project44 is our one-stop solution for all our visibility needs. The project44 team goes above and beyond to ensure that all of our needs are satisfied,” according to a director of transportation. “The platform is solid and provides us with real-time, accurate information 24/7/365.

42,75671bbe-4c09-31a6-82eb-2cdcbf6ba705,O,2023-06-01,"India pauses plans to add new coal plants for five years, bets on renewables, batteries",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-pauses-plans-add-coal-112300142.html,1685618580,STORY,['CL=F'],"[BENGALURU, India (AP) — The Indian government will not consider any proposals for new coal plants for the next five years and focus on growing its renewables sector, according to an updated national electricity plan released Wednesday evening.The temporary pause in the growth of the dirty fuel was hailed by energy experts as a positive step for a country that is currently reliant on coal for around 75% of its electricity.Updated every five years, the plan serves as a guideline for India’s priorities in its electricity sector.India is the world’s third highest emitter and most populous country. It plans to reach net zero emissions by 2070, which would mean significantly slashing coal use and ramping up renewable energy.In a draft of the plan released in September, the Central Electricity Authority, which is in charge of planning for India's electricity needs, projected that nearly 8,000 megawatts of new coal capacity was required by 2027. But Wednesday's strategy proposes the build out of more than 8,600 megawatts of battery energy storage systems instead.Battery storage is crucial for round-the-clock use of renewable energy.“This plan is a step in the right direction,” said Raghav Pachouri, an energy sector expert at Vasudha Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.Pachouri said one reason the plans for new coal might have been scrapped is because there are already some coal plants under construction.The country is also experiencing longer summers and hotter weather in part due to climate change, meaning greater electricity demand during the scorching day, making it easier to fulfill energy needs with renewables, said Pachouri.“When you need energy during the day, solar power can provide for it,” he said.India plans to install 500 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030, enough energy to power anywhere from 150 to 500 million homes depending on power use, but is not on course to meet that target, according to Aditya Lolla, an energy analyst at the think tank Ember.Story continues“We’re installing only up to 17 gigawatts a year, this needs to increase to 40 to 45 gigawatts to meet targets,” said Lolla.The new plan goes on to project that new coal power will be built after 2027, but Lolla says this should be taken with a pinch of salt.“Traditionally, projections for the coming five years are more concrete and those for the subsequent years are essentially placeholders,” said Lolla. “India wants to move towards a cleaner power system. With every electricity plan, the coal pipeline is falling.”Lolla predicts that with the current volatile global energy picture, due to Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change and pandemic recovery, India will take a call on its longer-term energy plan at a future date, depending on how things progress by 2027.___Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like ShaMaran Petroleum (CVE:SNM). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide ShaMaran Petroleum with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for ShaMaran Petroleum How Fast Is ShaMaran Petroleum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for ShaMaran Petroleum to have grown EPS from US$0.012 to US$0.039 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. On the revenue front, ShaMaran Petroleum has done well over the past year, growing revenue by 50% to US$181m but EBIT margin figures were less stellar, seeing a decline over the last 12 months. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historySince ShaMaran Petroleum is no giant, with a market capitalisation of CA$169m, you should definitely check its cash and debt before getting too excited about its prospects.Are ShaMaran Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Investors are always searching for a vote of confidence in the companies they hold and insider buying is one of the key indicators for optimism on the market. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.Belief in the company remains high for insiders as there hasn't been a single share sold by the management or company board members. But the real excitement comes from the US$128k that President Garrett Soden spent buying shares (at an average price of about US$0.064). It seems at least one insider has seen potential in the company's future - and they're willing to put money on the line.Should You Add ShaMaran Petroleum To Your Watchlist?ShaMaran Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. Most growth-seeking investors will find it hard to ignore that sort of explosive EPS growth. And in fact, it could well signal a fundamental shift in the business economics. If that's the case, you may regret neglecting to put ShaMaran Petroleum on your watchlist. Still, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with ShaMaran Petroleum (including 2 which are potentially serious).The good news is that ShaMaran Petroleum is not the only growth stock with insider buying. Here's  a list of them... with insider buying in the last three months!Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

It brought total output cuts to 3.66 million bpd, or about 4% of global consumption.The group of late has cut by more than its targets mainly because of capacity limitations in West African producers Nigeria and Angola.A Reuters survey found the two countries missed their output targets by a combined 600,000 bpd in May, while outages in the Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq meant the country produced 220,000 bpd below its target last month.The surprise announcement in April helped to drive benchmark Brent crude prices about $9 per barrel higher to above $87 over the days followed, but Brent has since lost those gains to trade below $73, under pressure from concerns about global economic growth and its impact on fuel demand.Last week, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told investors he said were shorting the oil price to ""watch out,"" which many market watchers interpreted as a warning of additional supply cuts.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak subsequently said he did not expect any new steps from OPEC+ in Vienna, Russian media reported.The Kremlin on Thursday did not comment on the meeting's outcome, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said relations with Saudi Arabia were ""constructive, based on mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual trust"".Story continues'EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE'""At this precise time, no change for the meeting but as usual, depending on the mood of some, everything can change,"" one OPEC+ source said. This view was echoed by three other sources, all of whom asked not to be named.Two other sources said it was too soon to be sure of the meeting's outcome.Beyond the unexpected April decision, the group has surprised markets several times in recent years.In March 2020, it abandoned production quotas altogether, launching a Saudi-Russian price war at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that sent oil prices 25% lower.It quickly re-established quotas with its biggest output cut to date of about 10 million bpd, agreed in April, 2020.HSBC said in a note on Wednesday it did not expect OPEC+ to change its policy, but that the group may cut output later if an expected market deficit in the second half of the year does not materialise and prices remain below $80 per barrel.""We think the current set of cuts, in addition to the stronger oil demand we expect from China and the West from the summer onwards, will bring about a deficit in the market in 2H23,"" the bank said.OPEC has said it expects oil demand growth to reach 2.33 million bpd this year as non-OPEC supplies grow by 1.4 million bpd.Goldman Sachs anticipated no change to OPEC+ policy this week, but predicted the group could ""utilise some partly offsetting hawkish rhetoric"".The bank also said OPEC+ may act later if prices remain below $80 in the second half of the year.(Reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar, Alex Lawler and Rowena Edwards in London, Maha El Dahan in Dubai and Moscow bureauEditing by Simon Webb and Barbara Lewis)]"

U.S. S&amp;P 500 e-Mini futures were 0.2% higher.The U.S. legislation in essence temporarily removes the federal government's borrowing limit through Jan. 1, 2025.

The comments saw the dollar dip to a one-week low versus the yen before adding 0.2%, while Treasury yields edged up from nearly two-week nadirs.""The market at the moment is also really focused on broad macro trends, such as options for tapers by central banks,"" said Sandrine Perret, a portfolio manager at Unigestion. ""We are not there yet, but closer to it.""Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained as much as 0.8% before giving up about half of its gains, rebounding after touching the lowest level since March 22 in the previous session.Story continuesA surprise swing to growth for Chinese factory activity had also provided a lift to sentiment, in a rare recent positive sign for the country's post-pandemic recovery. Crude oil prices clawed back from four-week lows.HIKE SKIP?Money markets currently lay about 38% odds for a hike from the Fed on June 14, swinging back from about 70% earlier on Wednesday, after some unexpectedly hot jobs numbers.However, shortly after, the Fed's Jefferson said skipping a rate hike in two weeks would provide policymakers time to see more data before making a decision. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker also said on Wednesday that for now he is inclined to support a ""skip"" in rate hikes.More closely watched employment data is due this week, with the ADP survey out later in the day, followed by the monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday.""It's been a fairly strong retracement in terms of the market's expectations for the June meeting, and it's come contrary to the data,"" said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG Markets.The euro eased ahead of euro zone inflation data, due at 0900 GMT. It was last down 0.2% at $1.06640, moving back toward Wednesday's two-month low of $1.0635.Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields edged up to 3.6829%, after dipping to 3.6140% overnight for the first time since May 18.(Reporting by Tom Wilson in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Lincoln Feast and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

Let’s focus on and understand how regular dividends are beneficial for an investor and a company.Here’s What Dividends Mean to InvestorsDividends create a reliable source of return without having to sell the shares. The payment of dividends is more dependable than capital appreciation on shares. With the incorporation of dividend-paying stocks in their portfolio, one can expect returns even in a volatile market.  Investors also get a tax advantage from dividends, making it more attractive.Dividend stocks are a lucrative option for investors looking for regular returns without having to wait for the shares to move up. Dividend investors target companies with a consistent dividend payment history and steady growth.Interpublic Group IPG, Omnicom Group OMC, Robert Half RHI and Western Union WU are some of the dividend-paying companies from the broader Zacks Business Services sector. While IPG and OMC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), RHI and WU have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.How Does a Dividend-Paying Company Benefit?A regular dividend-paying company is expected to have higher investor loyalty compared to a company not paying dividends. A company with a dividend-paying history is likely to recover faster after a major correction in the market compared to its non-dividend-paying peers.Factors to Consider While Picking Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks are rewarding but a rational investor should always make an informed decision. Some of the aspects that need to be considered while selecting stocks that will accomplish your dividend investing goals include its payout ratio, payment history, yield, and revenue and earnings growthThe payout ratio indicates how much a company is distributing as dividend from its earnings per share. A low payout indicates sustainable dividend payment. Consistent dividend payment, especially during tough times, is expected to grab investor attention. Yield is the annualized dividend as a percentage of the stock price. Selecting dividend payers with a track record of steady revenue and earnings growth and high yield ensures returns over the long term.Story continuesOur Dividend PicksWe ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify the abovementioned stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%.

Now she’s patching up a $27.7 billion marriage,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-picked-one-own-execs-095500531.html,1685613300,STORY,"['CRM', 'MSFT']","[Last fall, Lidiane Jones discovered that Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield was leaving Salesforce—by learning that she was a candidate for his job.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Jones was blindsided by the news but immediately interested in the “dream job” that combined her love of consumer-focused design with enterprise technology. “I was so emotionally invested because I was so excited,” she says. But she worried she “wasn’t going to be picked.”Jones was a somewhat unlikely contender for the role. For one, she didn’t work for Slack, the workplace productivity platform Salesforce acquired in 2021 for $27.7 billion. The 43-year-old was a Boston-based executive vice president overseeing Salesforce’s experience cloud, commerce cloud, and marketing cloud products—all key pieces of Salesforce’s product offering to enterprise customers. Slack didn’t fit that bill. It represented just 5% of Salesforce’s $31.4 billion in annual sales, and the omnipresent messaging tool didn’t overlap much with Jones’s duties.What’s more, Butterfield was departing after reportedly clashing with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff following the acquisition. (Salesforce declined to comment; Butterfield didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The next Slack CEO needed to take the reins from the platform’s founder, patch up the arranged marriage of Slack and Salesforce, and boost morale among Slack’s workforce even as its new corporate parent instituted 7,000 layoffs, Slackers included. A Salesforce incumbent hardly seemed like the pacifying pick.Yet it was Butterfield who publicly endorsed Jones for the job. In late 2022, Butterfield announced his exit—which Salesforce had kept quiet for weeks—and Salesforce named Jones as his successor; she reports to Salesforce chief product officer David Schmaier, not Benioff. In a departing note to Slack workers, Butterfield called Jones “one of us.” Jones says the line referred to her “obsession around customer focus.” But the note was also an effort to win Jones support from a Slack workforce that had the potential to mistrust its new outsider CEO.Story continuesJones entered the CEO role in January with a mandate to close the gulf between Slack and Salesforce culturally and commercially—to endear the two workforces to each other and effectively pair the companies’ tools to better meet today’s business needs. Plus, she has to convince a skeptical Wall Street of the business case behind the acquisition, Salesforce’s most expensive ever. It’s a daunting task, but Jones happens to be an expert bridge builder—personally, as an all-too-rare Latina tech executive, and professionally, as a veteran of integrating acquired businesses into their larger parents. Ultimately, her success could turn easy-to-use Slack, whose rat-a-tat notifications punctuate the modern workday, into the interface for Salesforce, a pioneering but clunky customer relationship management provider. Enterprise customers everywhere would cheer such a transformation, says Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin: “Nobody would ever have to use Salesforce again, and yet everybody would always be using Salesforce.”Born in São Paulo, Jones grew up in a small neighborhood within that big city. Her father worked factory jobs. Her mom was a cleaner. At 13, Jones won a school contest to earn a spot in a computer programming class—her first time accessing a computer. Programming ignited her passion for technology and software development, which seemed like “magic” to her. Jones earned a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, but almost didn’t get to go; she failed the Test of English as a Foreign Language required of international students the first time and just barely passed on her second try. When she arrived in Ann Arbor, she was still far from fluent. She missed the weather in Brazil; she lost “a ton of weight” her freshman year because she didn’t like french-fry-heavy Midwestern cuisine. “It was like, Oh, my God, what am I doing here?” she recalls.That transition was one of the “hardest things” she’s been through, Jones says. But she made friends in her unfamiliar surroundings, survived that first year, and became fluent in English. She earned a computer science degree and secured an internship at Apple, where she and fellow interns ate lunch next to Steve Jobs in the cafeteria.She intended to move back to Brazil, but she got a job at Microsoft as an Excel software engineer and met her husband, an American, in Seattle. (He still works at Microsoft, whose Teams program competes with Slack. “We don’t talk about work,” Jones says.) Microsoft employed people from all over the world—but “not a lot of Brazilians and not a lot of Latina women,” Jones says. She didn’t think much of it at first, but eventually she began noticing little slights, like when “nobody really heard what I said in that meeting,” she says. “I became more conscious over time.” So when Slack employees feel as though Salesforce doesn’t understand them, she has an idea of what that’s like.At Microsoft, she helped integrate virtualization startup Softricity, acquired in 2006, into what became Microsoft Intune, a management tool. Later, she oversaw the post-acquisition integration of another Microsoft target: collaboration software platform Groove Networks—an East Coast team acquired by a “giant company on the West Coast.” “There’s always patterns that are not too different,” Jones says. “The biggest one is just understanding each other’s language.” From Boston, Jones helped Microsoft “understand what’s so great about this team.” Feeling like she’d done all she could at Microsoft, she left in 2015 to try her hand at consumer technology at speaker company Sonos before jumping back to enterprise at Salesforce in 2019.“There's always patterns [to integrations] … The biggest one is just understanding each other's language.”Lidiane Jones, Slack CEOIn her new CEO role, Jones set out to make Slack more like Salesforce (a moneymaking enterprise tool) and to make Salesforce more like Slack (a creative platform that earns not just begrudging users but genuine fans).One of her earliest efforts to breach the cultural divide between Slack and Salesforce teams was a companywide memo featuring five tips for using Slack effectively. It went viral internally and, Jones says, sparked goodwill across teams. Jones advised brevity, consistency, authenticity, and, yes, a healthy dose of emojis. (Her favorite is a custom Slack logo emoji, its colored lines replaced with hearts.) They’re “incredibly effective in separating key points and adding dimension to your posts,” she wrote.The business integration challenge can’t be summarized so succinctly.Jones believes that Slack should be “the front door of Salesforce”—the product Salesforce customers check first. “For every job, you start your day, you open Slack, and you figure out, What should I do now?” she says. “If you’re a salesperson, which accounts should I target this month? Why? Which products are most valuable for these customers?” For Salesforce customers, who rely on the product but can be frustrated by its less-than-intuitive user experience, operating via Slack’s friendly and colorful UX would be transformative. Jones adds: “Salesforce is amazing at leading large enterprise relationships, and we want to bring more of that to Slack.”“Salesforce is amazing at leading enterprise relationships, and we want to bring more of that to Slack.”Lidiane Jones, Slack CEOSlackifying Salesforce is also a matter of redefining what counts as “creative,” Jones says: “If you’re a marketer, that’s a creative job. If you’re a salesperson or engaging with people, that’s a creative job. We can bring the sensibility of design across the portfolio.”Jones says she’s a genuine fan of Slack, having fallen for it while at Sonos. The programming-nerd CEO spends some of the little free time she has building Slack features; her latest is a tool that summarizes a channel or a thread on command.Jones isn’t just trying to convince her own employees of the Salesforce-Slack synergies. Wall Street thinks Salesforce overpaid for the workplace communications platform and questions why Salesforce customers would fork over extra money for the tool when they likely already have access to rival Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s stock is down 17% since the deal closed, and activist investors have pressured the company to be more efficient. Slack right now doesn’t complement the Salesforce suite the way the architects of the deal intended, analysts say. Benioff’s big talk in the high-growth days of 2020—he said Slack would put Salesforce on a path to a double its revenue to $50 billion—didn’t help set measured expectations. However, Wall Street is more optimistic about Slack’s long-term prospects.“[Slack] hasn’t been the growth driver they expected it to be,” says Baird analyst Rob Oliver. “But I don’t think that says much about the long-term value of Slack.”“[Slack] hasn't been the growth driver [Salesforce] expected it to be. But I don't think that says much about the long-term value of Slack.”Rob Oliver, Baird analystJones admits the earliest integrations between Slack and Salesforce weren’t particularly sexy; they were tweaks like authenticating Slack and Salesforce systems so users can move seamlessly between the two and access customer relationship management data on both platforms. She says that investors—and others—may be skeptical because the company hasn’t released flashier synergies yet. “The market just hasn’t seen a lot of integrations come to life,” she says. Oliver agrees: “We’re starting to see some of the beginnings of the fingerprints of that plan.”Slack does have more exciting integrations up its sleeve, Jones says. In May, Salesforce announced Slack GPT, a suite of conversational A.I. capabilities that mines Slack’s expertise: its knowledge of the people who make up an organization and how it functions. Slack could brief a user on the traits of a colleague they’re about to meet. Users could ask Slack, “What should I know about [them?] How should I prepare? What are two key pieces of information about them?” Jones says. Integrating that technology throughout Salesforce—not just in Slack, but in customer relationship management software, for example—could extend the tool beyond colleagues, to customers. “What’s the context of all that knowledge an organization has?” Jones asks.The Groove Networks acquisition Jones oversaw at Microsoft had a relatively positive long-term outcome: While the startup ditched its own name, its Boston-based workforce is still Microsoft’s Office Collaboration team a decade later. So is that what Slack’s future will look like? Jones says Slack will remain an independent unit within Salesforce “for the foreseeable future.” “It makes sense because it’s such a great, recognized brand,” she says.Slack’s brand gives Jones more visibility in her role than she might have if she were simply running a productivity software tool at another giant tech corporation; she’s taking advantage of that spotlight to talk up the business case for Slack at Salesforce. As for the competition? “I don’t hear a lot of people telling me they love to do their day-to-day jobs in Teams,” she says.This article appears in the June/July 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “In focus: Lidiane Jones.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Salesforce on Wednesday gave a lackluster outlook for future sales and maintained, rather than raised, its annual revenue forecast. The stock drop came despite the company reporting revenue, earnings and operating profit margin in the fiscal first quarter that topped analysts’ estimates.Even with Thursday’s fall, the shares have rallied 61% this year, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500.After a tumultuous six months that included job cuts, executive departures, board director changes and public pressure from multiple activists investors, Salesforce had been winning back the faith of many shareholders. During its March 1 earnings report, the San Francisco-based company, the top maker of customer relations management software, signaled an emphasis on profit and announced market-pleasing steps, including doubling stock buybacks and disbanding its committee on mergers and acquisitions.Read More: Salesforce Find Profit Is New Magic Word for Activist InvestorsBut amid the new focus, some are debating “the company’s ability to dramatically expand operating margin without impacting its ability to grow,” Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote ahead of earnings.Salesforce said growth in current remaining performance obligations, or contracted sales, will slow to 10% in the current quarter ending in July, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of more than 11%. The company also repeated its earlier fiscal-year forecast that revenue would increase 10% to about $34.6 billion — by far its slowest rate of expansion on record.Story continuesThe forecast implies reflects a cautious outlook about customer information technology budgets, Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote after the results. The failure to increase the annual sales guidance “may drive the stock lower in the near-term,” wrote Citibank’s Tyler Radke.The contracted sales outlook fell short of estimates because customers are looking for smaller consulting projects, said Mike Spencer, Salesforce executive vice president of investor relations. Pressure on revenue growth is due to broad economic factors rather than company cost cuts, he said, and the forecast doesn’t assume improvement or worsening of customer behavior.Executives are betting that interest around artificial intelligence could boost sales. “There’s only one thing that customers want to talk about and that’s artificial intelligence — and specifically generative AI,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said on a conference call after the results were released.The company is working on bringing its generative and data integration tools into all of its products, said Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham. “We’re perfectly positioned to help our customers harness the phenomenal power of AI,” he said. The current revenue outlook doesn’t factor in any of the potential benefits from AI, Spencer said.Like many of its peers, Salesforce has integrated AI features into its sales, marketing and workplace communication programs. It also launched a $250 million venture fund for generative AI startups.Salesforce’s profitability continues to climb. The company raised its already-aggressive operating profit margin 1 percentage point to 28% for the fiscal year ending in January. Millham said the company is focusing on employee productivity measures, including return-to-office rules. Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver said Salesforce is offsetting dilution from stock-based compensation with share buybacks.In the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, revenue increased 11% to $8.25 billion, topping the $8.18 billion average projected by analysts. Adjusted profit was $1.69 a share, compared with an estimate of $1.61. Operating margin was 27.6%. For the current quarter ending in July, sales will grow 10% to about $8.52 billion, the company said. Analysts, on average, estimated $8.49 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The quarter “represented another strong step forward as we accelerate our transformation and profitable growth strategy,” Weaver said in the statement.(Updates with closing share price in the second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s BYD Is Racing Toward the Top of the Global EV MarketSupreme Court Rulings Make White-Collar Fraud Charges in the US HarderPermits for US Energy Projects Are So Bad Unlikely Allies EmergeA $1.5 Trillion Backstop for Homebuyers Props Up Banks InsteadKeytruda Profits Show Why Merck Is Suing the US©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(AP) — A California judge on Wednesday dismissed all charges against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in connection to a 2020 fatal wildfire sparked by its equipment that destroyed hundreds of homes and killed four people, including an 8-year-old.The utility also reached a $50 million settlement agreement with the Shasta County District Attorney's Office, officials from both announced in separate statements.The wind-whipped blaze began on Sept. 27, 2020, and raged through rugged terrain and small communities west of Redding, killing four people, burning about 200 homes and blackening about 87 square miles (225 square kilometers) of land in Shasta and Tehama counties.In 2021, state fire investigators concluded the fire was sparked by a gray pine tree that fell onto a PG&amp;E distribution line. Shasta and Tehama counties sued the utility, alleging negligence. They said PG&amp;E failed to remove the tree even though it had been marked for removal two years earlier. The utility says the tree was subsequently cleared to stay.Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett determined that the company was criminally liable for the fire and charged the utility later that year.Shasta Superior Court Judge Daniel E. Flynn disagreed, and in a tentative ruling ahead of a hearing Wednesday said prosecutors did not present enough evidence to show PG&amp;E engaged in criminal conduct, according to the Sacramento Bee, which obtained a copy of the ruling.The “tree was not a known risk prior to the Zogg fire, and there is no evidence to support the People’s claim in their opposition that it was,"" the judge wrote.The utility said in a statement that under the agreement with Shasta County, which is subject to court approval, it will fund $45 million in contributions to organizations dedicated to rebuilding and assisting local communities. The company will also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the county.“We stand behind our thousands of trained and experienced coworkers and contractors working every day to keep Californians safe. We feel strongly that those good-faith judgments are not criminal,” said Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer of PG&amp;E Corporation.Story continuesBridgett said her goal was always to take PG&amp;E to trial and hold them criminally responsible but that Flynn's tentative ruling changed her position and she agreed to a settlement that includes dropping all charges.“I am unwilling to gamble with the safety of Shasta County,” she said. ""I have a responsibility to the community and needed to secure what I can for all the citizens to prevent future wildfires, prevent future deaths and devastation, and to be as prepared as our county can be if another one occurs.”Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a $150 million settlement between Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division over PG&amp;E’s role in the Zogg Fire. As part of the agreement, the utility will pay $10 million as a penalty to California’s General Fund, and invest $140 million in shareholder funds in new wildfire mitigation efforts, officials said.]"

67,0db9448d-729f-342c-ab61-67bfe4e87b27,NWS,2023-06-01,Realtor.com® May Housing Report: Home Price Gains Slow to Lowest Rate on Record,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-may-housing-report-100000396.html,1685613600.0,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In May, home price growth slowed to 0.9% year over year, as active inventory decreased in 21 out of 50 of the largest metros SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Home prices rose slightly in May, but price growth slowed to the lowest rate on record since 2016, suggesting home prices may not see a new peak in 2023, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Housing Trends Report released today. Additionally, home inventory growth continues to slow and is declining in many metro areas across the country as fewer sellers list their homes than last year and buyers compete over the remaining affordable homes for sale.""April and May are historically popular months to buy, and typically by this time in the year we've exceeded the prior year's peak home price. Weakening home price growth for the past 12 months is increasing the odds that we may not see a new home price peak this year, for the first time in the history of our listing data, which dates back to mid-2016, and this is likely welcome news to homeshoppers,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Despite stalling price growth, home listing prices are up slightly compared to last May, and with rates more than a percentage point higher than a year ago, buyers continue to face affordability headwinds. The good news for sellers is that buyers are still out there, and this month's slower growth in the active inventory of homes for sale indicates that shoppers are in the market and actively searching for homes that fit their needs and budget.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketA slower housing market means buyers in certain areas may find they can once again have an offer accepted when putting less down. A recent report from Realtor.com® found down payments declined for the first time since the second quarter of 2020, suggesting it's getting harder for buyers to keep up with costs and that a less competitive housing market may be opening up opportunities for buyers making somewhat smaller down payments. Fortunately, there are a number of down payment assistance programs also available to help buyers, who can search for programs using this tool on Realtor.com®.Story continues""As buyers' budgets are being stretched to the max, there are opportunities for negotiation, especially on homes that have been sitting on the market for a while,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""They can ask sellers to come down on the price, make costly repairs, as well as contribute to their closing costs or buy down their mortgage rates. If they're purchasing new construction, they can also request upgrades. This can add up to substantial savings.""May 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over May 2022Change over May 2019Median listing price+0.9% (to $440,000)+38.0 %Median listing price per square foot-0.3% (to $225)+47.1 %Active listings+21.5 %-50.7 %New listings-22.7 %-30.4 %Median days on market+14 days (to 43 days)-9 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+2.6 percentage points (to 12.7%)-2.6 percentage points Home price growth stallsHome listing prices were slightly higher in May compared to a year ago, but growth in the typical asking price of for-sale homes continued to decline to the low single digits. In addition, the median listing price on a square foot basis declined compared to last year for the first time in Realtor.com® data history. At this rate of slowing, asking prices are likely to decline relative to the previous year by next month. Despite this trend, home sellers continue to have high expectations of the housing market and buyers, in some cases, too high. The number of homes with price reductions – a sign that a seller needed to adjust pricing to attract a buyer – was higher than year ago levels but in line with pre-pandemic years.The U.S. median list price grew to $441,000 in May, up from $430,000 in April, and down -1.7% from June 2022's record high of $449,000. The annual growth rate slowed to +0.9% in May, down from April's 2.5% growth rate, to the lowest price growth in our records since 2016.Nationally, the median listing price per square foot declined (-0.3%) compared to the previous year for the first time in our data history since 2016.Higher mortgage rates and home prices compared to May of last year increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $296 (+15.5%) compared to a year ago.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 15 out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline. The greatest price declines were seen in Texas metros: Austin (-7.3% year over year), Houston (-5.9%), and San Antonio (-5.8%).Nationally, 12.7% of active listings had their price reduced in May, up from 10.2% in May of last year. While higher than last year, the rate is below typical 2017-2019 levels. Large southern metros saw the largest increase in the percentage of homes with price reductions, led by Austin, Texas (+11.9 percentage points year over year), San Antonio, Texas (+9.1 percentage points) and Oklahoma City, Okla. (+8.7 percentage points).Inventory tightens as fewer sellers list and buyers compete over remaining homes The U.S. supply of active homes for sales continued to grow in May relative to this time last year, but slowed for the third month in a row as fewer potential sellers opted to list their home for sale and as the market lapped the period of higher inventory growth that started in May 2022. Today's buyers are grappling with low inventory, but the slowing growth in active inventory in May indicates that buyers continue to search for and find deals. Despite sitting on relatively high home equity, sellers are staying on the sidelines, and the number of newly listed homes remains well below last year's level. In fact, the pace of new home listings in May was even lower than in May 2020 when the real estate market was still contending with pandemic-era closures and restrictions.Nationally, the number of active listings grew +21.5% year over year in May; however, the inventory growth rate continued to slow for the third month in a row. Both newly listed homes (-22.7%) and homes under contract (-18.1%), or pending listings, declined year over year.Compared to last year, active inventory decreased in 21 out of 50 of the largest metros. Markets that reported large yearly declines included San Jose, Calif. (-35.3%), Sacramento, Calif. (-27.3%), and Hartford, Conn. (-26.0%).Among the 50 largest metros, active inventory increased 20.8% over last year, driven exclusively by Southern metros, such as Nashville, Tenn. (+124.7%); Austin, Texas (+112.5%), and San Antonio, Texas (+93.4%). Despite high inventory growth compared to last year, most Southern metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.On average across the 50 largest metros, no region or metro area saw year-over-year increases in new listings in May. The South saw new listing activity decline the least (-20.4%) compared to the previous year, while they fell 32.9% in the West, 22.9% in the Northeast, and 22.8% in the Midwest.More days on market gives buyers time to search for homes and bargainIn May, the typical home spent two weeks longer on the market than the same time last year, but a shrinking difference since January's recent high suggests buyers are out shopping for homes and competition still exists. That's keeping sellers in a very good position, with well-priced, updated homes still attracting buyers and selling more than a week faster than was common before the pandemic.In May, the typical home spent 43 days on market, 14 days longer than this time last year, but 9 days faster than the pre-pandemic May 2017-2019 average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, the typical home spent 37 days on the market, 13 days more than the previous May. This trend was seen across all regions, with larger metros in the South seeing the greatest increase (+16 days), followed by the West (+12 days), Midwest (+9 days) and Northeast (+7 days).All of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the previous year. Time on market increased the most in Raleigh (+31 days), Austin (+28 days), and Miami (+27 days).May 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

The technology index is still up about 22% so far this year.""They've had an incredible run, so those valuation concerns are starting to manifest themselves,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.Adding to investor worries, May consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest since November as a standoff to raise the federal government's borrowing cap fanned worries about the economic outlook.Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rates hikes could push the economy into recession.According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.48 points, or 0.16%, to end at 4,124.14 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 43.76 points, or 0.35%, to 12,284.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.86 points, or 0.03%, to 33,300.65.The Congressional Budget Office said on Friday the U.S. faces a ""significant risk"" of defaulting on payment obligations within the first two weeks of June without a debt ceiling increase.Among gainers, First Solar Inc shares jumped after the solar panel maker acquired Sweden's thin-film solar cell technology firm Evolar AB.News Corp shares rallied after the media conglomerate beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit.

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Jones was blindsided by the news but immediately interested in the “dream job” that combined her love of consumer-focused design with enterprise technology. “I was so emotionally invested because I was so excited,” she says. But she worried she “wasn’t going to be picked.”Jones was a somewhat unlikely contender for the role. For one, she didn’t work for Slack, the workplace productivity platform Salesforce acquired in 2021 for $27.7 billion. The 43-year-old was a Boston-based executive vice president overseeing Salesforce’s experience cloud, commerce cloud, and marketing cloud products—all key pieces of Salesforce’s product offering to enterprise customers. Slack didn’t fit that bill. It represented just 5% of Salesforce’s $31.4 billion in annual sales, and the omnipresent messaging tool didn’t overlap much with Jones’s duties.What’s more, Butterfield was departing after reportedly clashing with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff following the acquisition. (Salesforce declined to comment; Butterfield didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The next Slack CEO needed to take the reins from the platform’s founder, patch up the arranged marriage of Slack and Salesforce, and boost morale among Slack’s workforce even as its new corporate parent instituted 7,000 layoffs, Slackers included. A Salesforce incumbent hardly seemed like the pacifying pick.Yet it was Butterfield who publicly endorsed Jones for the job. In late 2022, Butterfield announced his exit—which Salesforce had kept quiet for weeks—and Salesforce named Jones as his successor; she reports to Salesforce chief product officer David Schmaier, not Benioff. In a departing note to Slack workers, Butterfield called Jones “one of us.” Jones says the line referred to her “obsession around customer focus.” But the note was also an effort to win Jones support from a Slack workforce that had the potential to mistrust its new outsider CEO.Story continuesJones entered the CEO role in January with a mandate to close the gulf between Slack and Salesforce culturally and commercially—to endear the two workforces to each other and effectively pair the companies’ tools to better meet today’s business needs. Plus, she has to convince a skeptical Wall Street of the business case behind the acquisition, Salesforce’s most expensive ever. It’s a daunting task, but Jones happens to be an expert bridge builder—personally, as an all-too-rare Latina tech executive, and professionally, as a veteran of integrating acquired businesses into their larger parents. Ultimately, her success could turn easy-to-use Slack, whose rat-a-tat notifications punctuate the modern workday, into the interface for Salesforce, a pioneering but clunky customer relationship management provider. Enterprise customers everywhere would cheer such a transformation, says Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin: “Nobody would ever have to use Salesforce again, and yet everybody would always be using Salesforce.”Born in São Paulo, Jones grew up in a small neighborhood within that big city. Her father worked factory jobs. Her mom was a cleaner. At 13, Jones won a school contest to earn a spot in a computer programming class—her first time accessing a computer. Programming ignited her passion for technology and software development, which seemed like “magic” to her. Jones earned a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan, but almost didn’t get to go; she failed the Test of English as a Foreign Language required of international students the first time and just barely passed on her second try. When she arrived in Ann Arbor, she was still far from fluent. She missed the weather in Brazil; she lost “a ton of weight” her freshman year because she didn’t like french-fry-heavy Midwestern cuisine. “It was like, Oh, my God, what am I doing here?” she recalls.That transition was one of the “hardest things” she’s been through, Jones says. But she made friends in her unfamiliar surroundings, survived that first year, and became fluent in English. She earned a computer science degree and secured an internship at Apple, where she and fellow interns ate lunch next to Steve Jobs in the cafeteria.She intended to move back to Brazil, but she got a job at Microsoft as an Excel software engineer and met her husband, an American, in Seattle. (He still works at Microsoft, whose Teams program competes with Slack. “We don’t talk about work,” Jones says.) Microsoft employed people from all over the world—but “not a lot of Brazilians and not a lot of Latina women,” Jones says. She didn’t think much of it at first, but eventually she began noticing little slights, like when “nobody really heard what I said in that meeting,” she says. “I became more conscious over time.” So when Slack employees feel as though Salesforce doesn’t understand them, she has an idea of what that’s like.At Microsoft, she helped integrate virtualization startup Softricity, acquired in 2006, into what became Microsoft Intune, a management tool. Later, she oversaw the post-acquisition integration of another Microsoft target: collaboration software platform Groove Networks—an East Coast team acquired by a “giant company on the West Coast.” “There’s always patterns that are not too different,” Jones says. “The biggest one is just understanding each other’s language.” From Boston, Jones helped Microsoft “understand what’s so great about this team.” Feeling like she’d done all she could at Microsoft, she left in 2015 to try her hand at consumer technology at speaker company Sonos before jumping back to enterprise at Salesforce in 2019.“There's always patterns [to integrations] … The biggest one is just understanding each other's language.”Lidiane Jones, Slack CEOIn her new CEO role, Jones set out to make Slack more like Salesforce (a moneymaking enterprise tool) and to make Salesforce more like Slack (a creative platform that earns not just begrudging users but genuine fans).One of her earliest efforts to breach the cultural divide between Slack and Salesforce teams was a companywide memo featuring five tips for using Slack effectively. It went viral internally and, Jones says, sparked goodwill across teams. Jones advised brevity, consistency, authenticity, and, yes, a healthy dose of emojis. (Her favorite is a custom Slack logo emoji, its colored lines replaced with hearts.) They’re “incredibly effective in separating key points and adding dimension to your posts,” she wrote.The business integration challenge can’t be summarized so succinctly.Jones believes that Slack should be “the front door of Salesforce”—the product Salesforce customers check first. “For every job, you start your day, you open Slack, and you figure out, What should I do now?” she says. “If you’re a salesperson, which accounts should I target this month? Why? Which products are most valuable for these customers?” For Salesforce customers, who rely on the product but can be frustrated by its less-than-intuitive user experience, operating via Slack’s friendly and colorful UX would be transformative. Jones adds: “Salesforce is amazing at leading large enterprise relationships, and we want to bring more of that to Slack.”“Salesforce is amazing at leading enterprise relationships, and we want to bring more of that to Slack.”Lidiane Jones, Slack CEOSlackifying Salesforce is also a matter of redefining what counts as “creative,” Jones says: “If you’re a marketer, that’s a creative job. If you’re a salesperson or engaging with people, that’s a creative job. We can bring the sensibility of design across the portfolio.”Jones says she’s a genuine fan of Slack, having fallen for it while at Sonos. The programming-nerd CEO spends some of the little free time she has building Slack features; her latest is a tool that summarizes a channel or a thread on command.Jones isn’t just trying to convince her own employees of the Salesforce-Slack synergies. Wall Street thinks Salesforce overpaid for the workplace communications platform and questions why Salesforce customers would fork over extra money for the tool when they likely already have access to rival Microsoft Teams. Salesforce’s stock is down 17% since the deal closed, and activist investors have pressured the company to be more efficient. Slack right now doesn’t complement the Salesforce suite the way the architects of the deal intended, analysts say. Benioff’s big talk in the high-growth days of 2020—he said Slack would put Salesforce on a path to a double its revenue to $50 billion—didn’t help set measured expectations. However, Wall Street is more optimistic about Slack’s long-term prospects.“[Slack] hasn’t been the growth driver they expected it to be,” says Baird analyst Rob Oliver. “But I don’t think that says much about the long-term value of Slack.”“[Slack] hasn't been the growth driver [Salesforce] expected it to be. But I don't think that says much about the long-term value of Slack.”Rob Oliver, Baird analystJones admits the earliest integrations between Slack and Salesforce weren’t particularly sexy; they were tweaks like authenticating Slack and Salesforce systems so users can move seamlessly between the two and access customer relationship management data on both platforms. She says that investors—and others—may be skeptical because the company hasn’t released flashier synergies yet. “The market just hasn’t seen a lot of integrations come to life,” she says. Oliver agrees: “We’re starting to see some of the beginnings of the fingerprints of that plan.”Slack does have more exciting integrations up its sleeve, Jones says. In May, Salesforce announced Slack GPT, a suite of conversational A.I. capabilities that mines Slack’s expertise: its knowledge of the people who make up an organization and how it functions. Slack could brief a user on the traits of a colleague they’re about to meet. Users could ask Slack, “What should I know about [them?] How should I prepare? What are two key pieces of information about them?” Jones says. Integrating that technology throughout Salesforce—not just in Slack, but in customer relationship management software, for example—could extend the tool beyond colleagues, to customers. “What’s the context of all that knowledge an organization has?” Jones asks.The Groove Networks acquisition Jones oversaw at Microsoft had a relatively positive long-term outcome: While the startup ditched its own name, its Boston-based workforce is still Microsoft’s Office Collaboration team a decade later. So is that what Slack’s future will look like? Jones says Slack will remain an independent unit within Salesforce “for the foreseeable future.” “It makes sense because it’s such a great, recognized brand,” she says.Slack’s brand gives Jones more visibility in her role than she might have if she were simply running a productivity software tool at another giant tech corporation; she’s taking advantage of that spotlight to talk up the business case for Slack at Salesforce. As for the competition? “I don’t hear a lot of people telling me they love to do their day-to-day jobs in Teams,” she says.This article appears in the June/July 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “In focus: Lidiane Jones.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Sysco Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.87bUS$2.36bUS$2.83bUS$3.08bUS$3.27bUS$3.41bUS$3.53bUS$3.65bUS$3.75bUS$3.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.35%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$82bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$82b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$42bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$64b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$70.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.808. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

87,286c892a-5486-352f-a15c-81f1a120a3a7,ADM,2023-06-01,"Bunge, Viterra merger would create global agriculture trading giant",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bunge-viterra-merger-create-global-175300568.html,1685555580,STORY,"['BG', 'KW=F', 'FC=F', 'LC=F', 'ADM']","[By Karl PlumeMay 31 (Reuters) - A merger of U.S. grains merchant Bunge Ltd with rival Viterra would grow the combined entity's businesses in the U.S., Brazil and Australia and may raise competition concerns in parts of Canada and Argentina, where key oilseed processing assets overlap, analysts said.Sources last week said Bunge and Glencore Plc-owned Viterra were in talks for a potential mega deal that would further consolidate global agriculture trading and bring Bunge closer in global scale to leading rivals Archer-Daniels-Midland Co and Cargill Inc.""Combining Bunge and Viterra in regions like North America and Europe certainly would strengthen the combined company's presence there and put them more on par with ADM,"" said Seth Goldstein, equity analyst with Morningstar.""Bunge is already the leader in South America. That might be a region where there might be some divestitures required if a deal were to close there to make sure that there's still competition,"" he added.J.P. Morgan equity research estimated the combined company's market cap would be around $25 billion, compared with ADM's $38.9 billion market cap.In the United States, Viterra's business of buying and selling grain expanded via its purchase of Gavilon last year. A merger would enhance Bunge's grain exporting and oilseed processing businesses in a place it has a smaller presence than ADM and Cargill, one analyst said.Bunge had sold 35 of its U.S. grain elevators to Zen-Noh Grain Corp in 2020 as it sought to pare back underperforming assets. Bringing in Gavilon's grain sourcing network would help feed Bunge's nine U.S. oilseed processing plants and its two export terminals at the Gulf Coast and the Pacific Northwest.But in Canada, the companies have some overlap in their crushing businesses, which buy canola from farmers and turn it into vegetable oil and livestock feed.Bunge is the world's largest oilseed processor.Story continuesBunge and Viterra each crush canola on the Canadian Prairies – including plants in close proximity in southern Manitoba - as well as in eastern Canada. Antitrust authorities may require some of those assets be offloaded before approving the merger, some analysts said.Canada's Competition Bureau declined to comment.The two companies united would also create a dominant exporter in Brazil and a market-leading soybean crusher in Argentina, analysts said.Bunge last year was the largest corn and soybean exporter from Brazil, the world's top source of the staple crops for making animal feed and biofuels, according to data from shipping agent Cargonave. Viterra was the third largest corn exporter and No. 7 soybean shipper.Combined, the companies accounted for about 23.7% of Brazil corn exports in 2022 and 20.9% of Brazil soybean exports, Cargonave data showed.However, an analysis by Brazil's antitrust agency CADE would focus on a potential merger's effects on the domestic market, said Sao Paulo based antitrust lawyer Vicente Bagnoli, who is not involved in the deal.""I think CADE would not block this deal because there are other competitors on the market,"" he said.Regulatory authorities may focus on a merged company's dominant share of soy processing in Argentina, the world's biggest exporter of soymeal and soy oil, although Goldman Sachs research noted that capacity would remain under 25% of the market.Argentina's National Commission of Defense of Competition declined to comment.A merger would expand Bunge's physical grain storage and handling capacity in major wheat exporter Australia, where the company currently operates just two grain elevators and a port terminal in the western part of the country. Viterra has 55 storage sites in South Australia and western Victoria and six bulk grain export terminals.The marriage would also unite Bunge, the largest oilseed meal producer in the world, with Australia's biggest protein meal importer Viterra.In Ukraine, the world's top sunflower producer and largest supplier of sunflower oil, a combined Bunge-Viterra would have three oilseed processing plants across the country's south and east, in Kharkiv, Dnipro and Mykolaiv.

The country has surpassed the United States in soy and, more recently, corn exports.The data identifies the buyers as chicken producer Perdue Farms and global grains merchant Archer-Daniels-Midland Co . The Floriana, to be loaded with 32,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans, will be loaded at a Cargill terminal at the port of Santarem.Cargill, Perdue and ADM did not immediately respond to request for comment.The 120,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybean imports to the United States would be the largest since 2021, when nearly 178,000 tonnes arrived in May and June, according to U.S. Census Bureau trade data.If additional sales are made, U.S. purchases of Brazilian soybeans this year could be the largest since 2014 when imports hit a record 1.048 million tonnes.Analysts had pointed out the economics of the U.S. importing soy made sense, as Brazil harvests more than 154 million tonnes of soybeans this season, its biggest crop ever.The cost of grain not including freight in Brazil is $1.09 per bushel cheaper than U.S. beans for near term shipment, John Stewart and Associates wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, explaining imports therefore made sense for some East Coast crushers.

89,64b726f4-733a-3e22-acfa-02fde4788b17,ADM,2023-06-01,Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-company-adm-130010862.html,1685538010,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of -28.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -12.9%. This estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.17 indicates a change of -9.9% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $24.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.6%. The $97.8 billion and $97.99 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4% and +0.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.52%. The EPS surprise was +22.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Synopsys (SNPS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 22.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 20.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 9.6%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.4% over the past month.Bottom LineSynopsys has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Synopsys is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Synopsys (SNPS), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if SNPS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of software used to test and develop chips holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor SNPS, shares are up 8.87% over the past week while the Zacks Computer - Software industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 26.03% compares favorably with the industry's 1.36% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Synopsys have risen 28.66%, and are up 45.62% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 6.46% and 2.72%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to SNPS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SNPS is currently averaging 1,048,526 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with SNPS.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SNPS's consensus estimate, increasing from $10.54 to $10.69 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that SNPS is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Synopsys on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Soft Drink and Beverage companies have demonstrated that they can be some of the highest performing stocks in the market.While Coca-Cola KO and Pepsi PEP have shaped the industry for decades, several newer companies have proven that there is plenty of room for beverage innovation.Monster Beverage MNST, Celsius CELH, and Vita Coco COCO are all high-ranking stocks that have put up some incredible returns. COCO, the newest company, went public just 18 months ago and is already up 92% since its IPO.However, the returns of Celsius, and Monster Beverage are in a league of their own. Over the last 10 years CELH stock is up a mind boggling 51,800%, or 85% annualized. Over the last 20 years MNST stock is up an unbelievable 128,500%, or 42.5% annualized.The fresh new offerings from these companies haven’t gone unnoticed by the industry’s incumbents. In 2015, Coca Cola acquired a 16.7% equity stake in Monster Beverage and placed two directors on its board. Additionally, KO transferred its energy drink business to MNST, and MNST transferred its non-energy drink business to KO. The partnership has likely been beneficial to both companies.The beverage industry more broadly has been experiencing strong returns over the last year as well. It currently ranks in the top 10% of the Zacks Industry Rank, and has outperformed the market Indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCelsiusCelsius is an innovative beverage company that has gained significant attention for its unique line of fitness drinks. Focused on providing functional and healthy beverages, Celsius has positioned itself as a leader in the growing wellness industry.The company's flagship product, Celsius Fitness Drink, stands out for its thermogenic properties and ability to enhance metabolism and energy levels. With a commitment to science-backed formulations and quality ingredients, CELH has built a loyal customer base among fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers.Story continuesThe brand's success can be attributed to its targeted marketing strategies, extensive distribution network, and strategic partnerships with athletes and fitness influencers.CELH has seen its earnings estimates revised significantly higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 14.8% are expected to grow 158% YoY and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 32.7% and are expected to grow 154% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales over the last decade at CELH have gone absolutely parabolic. In just the last four years revenue has 10x’d from $75 million to $780 million. That pace looks like it is going to keep up, as the current quarter sales are projected to grow 75% YoY and FY23 sales are expected to climb 68% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCelsius has an admittedly lofty valuation. Trading at a TTM price to sales ratio of 13.8x it is well above the industry average of 4.9x, and its 10-year median of 5.7x. It is worth noting that MNST is trading at a 9.4x multiple, which is high compared to any standard. However, its 10-year median is 8.8x, so it is just about in line with its historical average.This shows just how high the market is willing value these successful beverage companies. While CELH may not be the next MNST, it likely has a few more years of exponential revenue growth, making the sky-high valuation a bit more palatable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVita CocoVita Coco is a leading beverage company that has made a significant impact in the coconut water market. Recognizing the growing demand for natural and healthier hydration options, Vita Coco has successfully established itself as a trusted brand offering premium coconut water products.COCO sources its coconuts from carefully selected regions to ensure the highest quality and taste. Vita Coco's beverages are known for their refreshing flavor, natural electrolytes, and hydrating properties, making them a popular choice among fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers.With a strong commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing practices, Vita Coco has not only captured a significant market share but also earned a reputation as a socially responsible brand. As the demand for healthier beverages continues to rise, COCO is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and maintain its position as a leading player in the coconut water market.Vita Coco currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by nearly 5% and are expected to see growth of 191% YoY. Additionally, FY23 sales are projected to grow 11.7% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCOCO is trading at a TTM price to sales ratio of 3.4x, which is well below the industry average of 4.9x, and above its two-year median of 1.8x. Considering how rapidly the drink has become one of the most popular coconut water drinks in the market this may be a compelling valuation, especially when compared to MNST and CELH.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonster BeverageMonster Beverage is a powerhouse in the global beverage industry, known for its iconic energy drink brand. With a strong presence in over 90 countries, MNST has cemented its position as a market leader. The company's flagship product, Monster Energy, has gained widespread popularity for its bold flavors, potent caffeine content, and association with extreme sports and lifestyle.Leveraging a successful marketing strategy that targets a youthful demographic, Monster Beverage has effectively built a strong brand image and cultivated a dedicated following. Despite facing fierce competition in the energy drink space, Monster Beverage's relentless commitment to product innovation, strategic partnerships, and expanding product portfolio continues to drive its growth and reinforce its position as a dominant player in the ever-energetic beverage market.MNST boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting its upward trending earnings revisions. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by 9.2% and are expected to grow 38.4% YoY, an incredible growth rate for a mature company. Additionally, FY23 sales are expected to grow 12.5% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlmost as impressive as its stock returns are the growth in earnings per share. From 2004 to 2022 EPS have grown from $0.02 to $1.22, which is a CAGR of 23%. Also interesting is that net income has been ~20% revenue almost every single year, showing incredibly stability of the company’s financial management.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMNST offers an insight into what a powerful return on equity looks like. Monster Beverage has $8.8 billion in total assets, and just $1.5 billion in liabilities, leaving shareholder equity at ~$7.4 billion. With that equity it produces $1.3 billion in net income, an 18% return on equity, which MNST will likely be able to produce for decades to come. That is an enviable position for any company.Bottom LineBeverage companies enjoy strong fundamental factors when the business is executed properly. Drinks are easily and regularly consumed, sometimes multiple times per day. Especially when brands get into something like the health niche, consumers can identify with brand making customers consumption even stickier. Additionally, there are massive, readily available networks for drinks to be distributed, from supermarkets to convenience stores and direct to consumers among others. Lastly, beverages have great margins, allowing them the potential to be extremely profitable.Investors have a few options when it comes to investing in drink companies; buy shares in the leaders like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, who often absorb smaller and fast-growing start-up brands. Buy shares in the newcomers like those listed above or find an even newer brand that fits into some trending niche with high risk, but high reward potential. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pay to check your luggage. Pay to bring your carry-on bag on the plane. Pay for your seat.More: Don’t Buy Airline Tickets on This Day of the Week See: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchBut what if you want to fly with some style, but within a budget? GOBankingRates asked travel experts for their input on which airlines provide the best value for your travel budget.Whether you’re a frequent flier or a less-frequent flier who wants a combination of a fair price and top-flight perks and customer service, the experts named these airlines as those deserving of your consideration.Southwest AirlinesSouthwest Airlines received the highest praise from the experts. So what perks and policies gave Southwest the top honor?“While it may be considered a no-frills airline, their offerings are perfect for domestic flights,” said Brittanie Harbick, co-host of the Travel Squad Podcast. “One major advantage is that you can check two bags for free with every flight, which alone will save you a minimum of $50 per flight. Another perk is the free drink coupons they send to Rapid Rewards members. Their online platform is user friendly, which makes flight bookings a breeze.Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?“My favorite perk is that if you notice a price drop on your purchased flight, you have the option to change your flight to the same one and receive a credit for the price difference, with the added benefit that the credit will never expire.”Travel experts said you’ll want to join the Rapid Rewards program for the benefits that will come your way as you fly with Southwest more often.“Becoming a loyalty member can unlock further benefits, especially if you achieve A-list, A-list preferred or companion pass,” Harbick said. “A-list status gives you perks like a dedicated customer service line, same-day standby and same-day change for no additional cost. However, my favorite status to earn is companion pass, which I’ve earned twice and grants me the privilege of adding another person to my reservation for only the cost of taxes. Companion pass has saved my household hundreds of dollars per flight, with a few thousand overall saved throughout the year.”Story continuesDelta Air LinesTo Hans Mast, a travel advisor with Golden Rule Travel, Southwest is the No. 1 option if you’re checking your bags. If you’re flying with just your carry-on, Delta Air Lines ranks at the top of the list for him.“Their customer service is superior in every way: operational reliability, onboard service, plane interiors, pre- and post-purchase customer service and irregular operations recovery. They are the most willing of the U.S. carriers to quickly put you on competing carriers when things go wrong.”Delta also has a couple of attractive extras, one especially reserved for first-class fliers, said blogger Jen Ruiz, who runs Jen on a Jet Plane.“Delta’s new free Wi-Fi offering is attractive,” she said, “and they have lay-flat seats on Delta One for select domestic flights if someone wants bang for their buck in first class.”JetBlueGenni Franklin, blogger at the Traveling Franklins, is another Southwest fan who has almost equal admiration for JetBlue.“I really enjoy the products with JetBlue and Southwest,” Franklin said. “These airlines know how to keep things simple and affordable without sacrificing convenience. I love the fact that they don’t make me feel like they’re constantly trying to empty my wallet, unlike some other budget carriers out there. Plus, they’ve got some awesome perks that make the whole flying experience even better and affordable.“I also enjoy the snack selection on JetBlue. I cringe every time I get a Biscoff cookie or a Stroopwafel in economy with other airlines. For the low fare, the complimentary snack selection in JetBlue is one of the best in economy.”Singapore Airlines“For international travel, Singapore Airlines is worth a mention,” said Laura Lynch, founder of Go Travel California. “Now, they might not be the first name on your lips when budgeting, but their services offer perks hard to ignore. They serve food that actually qualifies as ‘delicious’ — when was the last time you said that about airline food? Their flight attendants are so attentive it feels more like a high-altitude restaurant than an airplane. And their in-flight entertainment? It’s like your personal movie and TV show archive up in the clouds.”Emirates Airlines“One airline that has stolen my heart is Emirates,” said Shelley Marmor, operator of Travel Mexico Solo. “The experience with Emirates is nothing short of mind blowing. The moment you step on board, you’re greeted with warmth and hospitality that melts your worries.“Emirates doesn’t hold back when it comes to making your long-haul flights feel like a breeze. Spacious seats? Check. Delicious meals? Check. A vast selection of entertainment options to keep you entertained for hours on end? Double check. They’ve mastered the art of pampering you from takeoff to landing.”More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyVote for Your Favorite: GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Which Airline Should You Use Based on Your Budget?

Certification of that aircraft is still projected to occur in 2024, but will depend on when Boeing is approved to begin those flights, he said.""The amount of documentation that we're producing on these airplanes relative to what we had to produce in the past is considerably much larger than it has been,"" Fleming said.Asked about Boeing's comments, the FAA said ""safety will dictate the timeline.

They worked all day for and lived at the factory, forbidden from leaving.This operation is one of dozens across the EU that regional policing and anti-fraud agencies say have driven seizures of illicit cigarettes to record levels.Crime groups, which have traditionally mainly sourced fake tobacco products from outside the EU, are increasingly setting up production facilities in western Europe to be closer to higher-priced markets, according to Reuters interviews with half a dozen specialists in the field, including enforcement officials, tobacco executives and industry analysts.The trend was revved up by the travel shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, which choked supplies from outside the bloc, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said. It may have been further accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which for years has been a production hub and transit route for illicit tobacco, OLAF added.As well as the human cost, counterfeiting is a financial thorn in the side of the world's biggest tobacco companies at a time when they're facing a global decline in smoking that's spurred large investments in alternative products like vapes.""Criminal gangs have switched from importing counterfeit products into Europe to establishing illicit manufacturing facilities within EU borders,"" said Cyrille Olive, British American Tobacco's (BAT) regional head of anti-illicit trade.BAT - one of tobacco's global giants with Imperial Brands , Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International - has seen increased counterfeiting since last year in France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Denmark and the Czech Republic, Olive added.Story continuesSome campaigners have accused Big Tobacco of overstating the size of the illicit market to help lobby against higher taxes - something the companies deny. Nonetheless, the latest data shows seizures of illicit cigarettes are increasing.A record 531 million illicit cigarettes were impounded across the EU last year, a rise of 43% from the roughly 370 million seized in 2020, according to data from OLAF. About 60% of the cigarettes were from illicit production in the bloc while the rest were smuggled in.Europol told Reuters that last year would also likely set a record for the number of illegal cigarette factories that were reported shut down by national police forces, although the full-year data isn't yet available.TOBACCO INVESTIGATORSThe industry has responded by hiring investigators to research illicit operations and share intelligence with European authorities, executives at Japan Tobacco, BAT and Imperial Brands told Reuters.The three tobacco majors declined to put a figure on the financial hit from the illicit trade. Japan Tobacco has, though, spent ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" gathering information on the counterfeiters which it then passes on to European authorities like OLAF, according to Vincent Byrne, head of the company's anti-illicit trade operations.""We have a dedicated function within the company to try and protect our assets, protect our brands, and combat illegal trade,"" said Byrne, a former detective who investigated organised crime in Ireland.BAT and Imperial Brands said they also had intelligence operations.Philip Morris International declined to comment for this article.PACK: LESS THAN A EURO TO MAKECounterfeiters typically replicate popular cigarette brands, which include Japan Tobacco's Winston, Philip Morris' Marlboro, British America's Dunhill and Imperial Brands' Nobel.A packet of 20 cigarettes costs less than a euro to make, said Byrne, but trades at several times that, depending on the marketplace.Supplies from China and other parts of Asia - which used to be the biggest sources of counterfeit cigarettes that ended up in the EU - shrank during COVID-19 lockdowns, spurring increasing production in Europe itself, according to Alex McDonald, head of group security at Imperial Brands.Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have quickened that trend, said Ernesto Bianchi, OLAF's director of revenue and international operations, investigations and strategy, adding that the agency was ""analysing how the fraudsters may have reconfigured their routes"".Ukraine had been a hub for the manufacturing of illicit tobacco and a supply route for illicit and counterfeit cigarettes made in Russia and Belarus, activities that may have been disrupted by the war, Imperial Brands' McDonald said.Some counterfeiters are luring and coercing Ukrainian refugees to be workers.An illegal tobacco factory was dismantled last month in Roda de Ter, 80 km from Barcelona, Spanish police said on Thursday. Officers seized 11,400 kilos of tobacco and 7,360 packets of cigarettes. Six Ukrainians were found working there.In Italy, officials said in April last year they had found about 82 tonnes of counterfeit cigarettes inside a factory in the industrial area of the country's ​​Pomezia municipality.Investigators said they found Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian workers doing gruelling shifts in an unsafe environment where walled-up windows stopped fumes escaping.""A good many workers from Ukraine have been found in these illegal factories,"" Japan Tobacco's Byrne said about counterfeiting operations across the EU.""They're collected in a van at an airport, blacked out windows, driven around and swapped into another van,"" Byrne, said recounting a particular incident.""Eventually they're delivered to the factory. Mobile phones are taken from them. Essentially, it's a form of modern-day slavery.""($1 = 0.9310 euros) (Reporting by Richa Naidu in London, Emma Pinedo in Madrid and Emilio Parodi in Milan; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Pravin Char)]"

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Philip Morris is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate of $8.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.3%. The $35.18 billion and $36.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.8% and +4.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let’s focus on and understand how regular dividends are beneficial for an investor and a company.Here’s What Dividends Mean to InvestorsDividends create a reliable source of return without having to sell the shares. The payment of dividends is more dependable than capital appreciation on shares. With the incorporation of dividend-paying stocks in their portfolio, one can expect returns even in a volatile market.  Investors also get a tax advantage from dividends, making it more attractive.Dividend stocks are a lucrative option for investors looking for regular returns without having to wait for the shares to move up. Dividend investors target companies with a consistent dividend payment history and steady growth.Interpublic Group IPG, Omnicom Group OMC, Robert Half RHI and Western Union WU are some of the dividend-paying companies from the broader Zacks Business Services sector. While IPG and OMC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), RHI and WU have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.How Does a Dividend-Paying Company Benefit?A regular dividend-paying company is expected to have higher investor loyalty compared to a company not paying dividends. A company with a dividend-paying history is likely to recover faster after a major correction in the market compared to its non-dividend-paying peers.Factors to Consider While Picking Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks are rewarding but a rational investor should always make an informed decision. Some of the aspects that need to be considered while selecting stocks that will accomplish your dividend investing goals include its payout ratio, payment history, yield, and revenue and earnings growthThe payout ratio indicates how much a company is distributing as dividend from its earnings per share. A low payout indicates sustainable dividend payment. Consistent dividend payment, especially during tough times, is expected to grab investor attention. Yield is the annualized dividend as a percentage of the stock price. Selecting dividend payers with a track record of steady revenue and earnings growth and high yield ensures returns over the long term.Story continuesOur Dividend PicksWe ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify the abovementioned stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. These stocks have a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interpublic Group’s 2023 earnings indicates 7.65% year-over-year growth. The company will pay out a dividend of 31 cents on Jun 20. It has a payout ratio of 47%. The company’s annualized dividend comes at $1.24 a share, currently yielding 3.3%.

However, with improving business economics, upgraded earnings and a compelling technical chart pattern SHAK may be in the early stages of a major bull run.After developing a large base over the last year SHAK has consolidated and broken out from a convincing bull flag. This is exactly the kind of price action you see when large institutions are building positions.Now, the stock is forming a descending bull flag and this continuation pattern could send the stock higher yet again. If SHAK can trade above $66, it should move forcefully higher in a short time. Alternatively, if it trades below $64.50 the pattern is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another trade setup.The road to success for fast casual restaurants is extremely challenging, as it is a highly competitive market with numerous entrenched contenders. However, from a completely subjective position, I have to say SHAK is my favorite food-chain restaurant out there. Its smashed burgers are cooked to perfection, and basically melt in your mouth, while the shakes and custards are insanely delicious with some unique flavor combinations.Additionally, the restaurants are always tidy and well managed. Many people I know have similar views of the brand as well. I think for consumer brands, personal experiences can be a useful way to gauge a company’s prospects, although certainly not a complete methodology.Bottom LineIt is hard to deny that the stock market has resumed its long-term bull trend, and many leading stocks are moving aggressively higher. By utilizing the Zacks Rank, investors can easily identify stocks with strong near-term expectations, and find companies to further dive into.By focusing on firms with industry leading technologies, and deeply satisfied customers, investors can stay on the right side of the market.

Shares have lost about 2.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Legget &amp; Platt due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Leggett Q1 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat, Margins Down Y/YLeggett &amp; Platt, Inc. reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results. Both earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Impressively, the top and bottom lines came ahead of the company’s expectations also.However, both the metrics decreased on a year-over-year basis. The downtrend was caused by weak demand in residential end markets, dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment pressure.President and CEO of Leggett, Mitch Dolloff, said, ""We delivered first quarter results that were above our expectations but lower than our record first quarter results last year. Operating results were largely in line with our expectations, but several expenses were lower than expected in the first quarter. Given continued demand volatility, our full year guidance range remains unchanged.”Quarter in DetailLeggett reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share, which beat the consensus estimate of 27 cents by 44.4%. Nonetheless, the bottom line decreased 49% from 66 cents reported a year ago.Net trade sales of $1.21 billion topped the consensus mark of $1.2 billion by 0.9%. Yet, it declined 8% from the prior-year quarter’s levels of $1.32 billion.Organically, sales were down 11% year over year. Raw-material-related selling prices ailed the results by 3%. Volume reduced sales by 7% due to continued demand softness in residential end markets partially offset by growth in the Automotive, Aerospace, and Hydraulic Cylinders businesses. Also, currency impacted sales by 1%. Acquisitions, net of small divestitures, contributed 3% to sales growth.Adjusted EBIT declined 35.1% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $89.3 million. The downside was due to lower volume and lower metal margin in the Steel Rod business.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 7.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 280 bps to 11.1%.Story continuesSegment DetailsBedding Products: Net trade sales (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 17% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $522.4 million. A 9% decline in volume was caused by softness in the U.S. bedding markets and lower demand in Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses.Raw-material-related selling price and currency fluctuation impacted sales negatively by 7% and 1%, respectively. Organically, sales were down 17% year over year.Adjusted EBIT margin fell 590 bps to 5.8%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 510 bps year over year to 10.8%.Specialized Products: Trade sales rose 21% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $302.8 million. Volume increased by 11% across the segment.A favorable selling price increased sales by 2% and Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 13%. Currency impact lowered sales by 5%. Organically, sales were up 8% year over year.EBIT margin contracted by 300 bps to 8.7%. EBITDA margin plunged 330 bps year over year to 12.1%.Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products: Trade sales declined 13% from the prior-year quarter’s level to $370.6 million. Volume was down 15% across the segment.Raw-material-related selling price added 1% to sales. Currency impacted sales by 1%.  Textiles acquisitions added 2% to the growth. Organically, sales were down 15% year over year.EBIT margin of 8.8% was down 200 bps from the prior year. EBITDA margin also contracted 180 bps to 10.4%.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, the company had $870 million in liquidity. It had $344.5 million of cash and equivalents at March 2023-end compared with $361.5 million at 2022-end.Long-term debt was $2.11 billion, up 2% from $2.07 billion from 2022-end. The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.88x at first quarter-end compared with 2.32x in the year-ago period and 2.66x at 2022-end.Cash from operations for the reported quarter totaled $96.7 million compared with $39 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $38 million in first quarter compared with $19 million in previous year.2023 GuidanceLeggett expects sales in the range of $4.8–$5.2 billion, indicating a decline of 7% to growth of 1% year over year owing to low-single digit down volume. Raw-material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits.Sales are likely to be down low-single digit in the Bedding Products and Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segments. Nonetheless, it is expected to be up-high single digit in Specialized Products. In 2023, acquisitions are expected to add nearly 3% to sales.Earnings are projected to be between $1.50 and $1.90 per share due to lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business, lower volume in some businesses and moderate pricing pressure from deflation. LEG expects EBIT margin to be in the range of 7.5-8%.Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs, and operating cash flow are estimated to be $100-$130 million, $200 million and $450–500 million, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be $240 million and $85 million, respectively. Effective tax rate for the year is anticipated at 24%.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Legget &amp; Platt has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After declining 16% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for PRGOThe RSI reading of 29.6 for PRGO is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for PRGOThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for PRGO has increased 0.8%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, PRGO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

119,7aa1e8dd-6db7-32a4-bfe6-c50b28b22c6d,AIG,2023-06-01,"Billionaire Cliff Asness Says Recession Is a Pretty Scary Risk, but Has Been Loading Up on These 2 Stocks",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-cliff-asness-says-recession-202017798.html,1685564417,STORY,"['AIG', 'AIG-PA', 'CI']","[Fears of a recession causing havoc to the markets are not reserved solely to the average investor. Even some of Wall Street’s most lauded stock pickers are worried about the implications.Citing an unnerving disconnect between the current positioning of stocks and bonds – essentially, the bond market pricing in a recession while stocks appear to factor in a more optimistic outlook – billionaire Cliff Asness thinks things could get hairy if a recession comes into play.“If inflation stays sticky or it comes down because we enter a nontrivial recession – it’s equities that I think are in a scary place,” Asness recently opined. “They’re not priced very consistently with bonds.”That’s not to say the co-founder and CIO of AQR Capital Management – a firm with $100 billion in assets under management – is turning away from stocks. In fact, the quant investing sage has been loading up on the equities he must believe are able to fend off any unwanted economic developments.We ran a pair of his choices through the TipRanks database to see what the rest of the Street has to say about them. Here are the results.The Cigna Group (CI)If a recession is about to mess things up, a safe harbor is often provided by healthcare stocks, a segment seen as one able to withstand an economic downturn. Cigna might be a good example of their value. The global health services organization is a huge industry player, boasting a market cap over $72 billion, and specializing in providing a wide range of healthcare solutions to individuals, employers, and government entities.The company operates via two primary divisions – Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth offers a comprehensive set of services and capabilities that include benefits management, care management, intelligence, and pharmacy solutions. Cigna Healthcare division brings together the former U.S. Medical segment (U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government) and the remaining International Health business. This division offers medical solutions across various markets with a focus on local needs.Story continuesThe size and span of the business is easy to gauge from the company’s revenue haul. In the most recently reported quarter – for 1Q23 – the top-line reached $46.5 billion, amounting to a 5.7% year-over-year increase and beating the forecast by $1.07 billion. There was a beat on the bottom-line too, as adj. EPS of $5.41 came in above the $5.24 consensus estimate. For the outlook, the company raised expectations for both the sales and the profit profile.Nevertheless, despite the market’s positive reaction to the print, with the shift in 2023 from value names to tech – and after outperforming last year – CI shares have taken a beating in 2023.Evidently, Asness felt the time was right to increase his CI stake. During Q1, he loaded up on 560,014 shares, increasing his holdings by 95% to a total of 1,152,991 shares. These currently command a market value of over $316 million.Mirroring that confident stance, Truist analyst David S. MacDonald saw plenty to like in the Q1 report. The 5-star analyst wrote, “We remain bullish on CI following a solid start to ’23 marked by balanced growth across segments, top and bottom-line beats, better MCR and raised guidance. Importantly, the call and enhanced 10-Q disclosures provided additional detail/comfort around rebate retention exposure/retail spread, PBM affordability and transparency and we think should help allay concerns about potential regulatory risk. Finally, the capital light business model continues to churn out attractive FCF, providing ample flexibility for ongoing investment/expansion.”These comments underpin MacDonald’s Buy rating while his $375 price target makes room for 12-month returns of ~52%. (To watch MacDonald’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 4 Buys and 8 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $317.69, suggesting ~28% from current levels. As an added bonus, CI also pays a dividend. The current quarterly payout stands at $1.23, yielding 1.88%. (See Cigna stock forecast)American International Group (AIG)For our next Asness-endorsed name will turn to insurance giant AIG. The company is one of the world’s largest insurance and financial services organizations. Operating through various subsidiaries, AIG provides a wide range of insurance products and services to customers in over 80 countries. AIG’s offerings include property and casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement products, and mortgage insurance, among others.Driven by robust underwriting gains, the global insurance powerhouse beat the profit estimates in its latest quarterly report – for 1Q23. Representing its strongest first quarter underwriting results, general insurance underwriting income climbed by 13% year-over-year to $502 million. That helped adj. EPS rise from $1.49 in the year-ago quarter to $1.63, while outpacing the $1.42 the analysts were looking for. And while partially negated by lower alternative investment income, total consolidated net investment income still climbed 9% to $3.5 billion.Furthermore, the company gave a boost to its quarterly dividend, raising it from $0.32 to $0.36 per share, the first increase since 2016. The dividend currently yields 2.37%.It’s safe to say Asness has confidence in AIG’s ongoing success. He increased his holdings by 79% in Q1 with the purchase of 2,557,149 shares. He now holds a total of 5,794,696 shares, worth ~$306 million.AIG also gets the support of Goldman Sachs analyst Alex Scott. Scanning the latest financial statement, Scott explains why was impressed with the results. “We were very encouraged by the AIG earnings report this quarter as it showed favorable growth, further loss ratio improvement, favorable reserve development despite inflationary pressures, contained catastrophes despite elevated industry experience, net investment income benefiting to a greater degree than we expected from higher interest rates, and corporate expense discipline,” Scott said. “Further, we felt that the discussion around 1) the ultimate level of corporate expenses and 2) margin improvement in US personal lines was also a positive for the earnings power of the company.”Accordingly, Scott rates AIG shares a Buy, backed by a $79 price target. The implication for investors? Potential upside of ~50% from current levels. (To watch Scott’s track record, click here)Overall, 13 analysts have chimed in with AIG reviews over the past 3 months, and these break down into 8 Buys and 5 Holds, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $67.69 average target, a year from now, investors will be sitting on returns of 28%.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home U.K.-based Bloomsbury Publishing reported record annual sales and profit Wednesday, crediting them to the return of hardcovers and paperbacks as a replacement for more expensive forms of entertainment.“A paperback is much cheaper than even a one-month subscription to many services,” Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, comparing the price of a book to a Netflix Premium subscription worth $19.99 a month.“You get two books every month for this money, and you get 24 books a year. You’d never have a moment left,” Newton said.Bloomsbury, which has published several leading books including the Harry Potter series, saw an increase of 15% in revenue and 16% in pre-tax profits between March 2022 and February 2023, compared to a year earlier. The sales of children’s books were up 17%, driven by hit titles from author Sarah J Maas, and adult book sales were up 5%.In the company’s earnings release, Newton said that this marked the company’s “best ever performance” in nearly four decades, pointing out some of the underlying economic factors fueling the trend.“In challenging economic times, readers are turning to books as affordable as they cut back on more expensive forms of diversion,” Newton said in a statement. The company’s operations stretch well beyond the U.K., with international revenues accounting for 73% of Bloomsbury’s total revenues.Persistent inflation and the elevated cost of consumer staples like groceries have eaten into people’s budgets and limited their ability to spend on luxuries. The cost of living in the U.K. has sky-rocketed in recent months with food and non-alcoholic beverage prices increases hitting a 45-year high in March.Story continuesStreaming services—including Netflix—have raised their prices as well. These increases have not been limited in the U.K., and other big markets including the U.S. have also seen price hikes.Bloomsbury claimed that its success can be attributed to its strategy of focusing on consumer as well as academic books. It’s also growing its digital segment, which includes providing academic resources to universities, where revenues grew 41% in the last year.Bloomsbury did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.Are books really here to stay?The COVID-19 pandemic forced people to stay indoors for prolonged periods, forcing many to find new ways—or in this case, a time-tested way—to pass time. Physical book sales jumped globally in 2020, with U.K. sales hitting 202 million books and U.S. sales reaching 751 million. In both cases, they were among the highest book sales figures compared to the immediate few years prior, the Guardian reported.While other alternatives like e-books have become a more convenient option for readers in recent years, physical book sales still outpace any other format.Streaming companies like Netflix and Disney are evaluating their streaming offerings after years of eating high costs to grow market share and develop content. Netflix recently expanded its password-sharing crackdown to the U.S., while Disney is considering a price hike to its flagship Disney+ service.As for subscribers of streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and HBO Max, studies have found users to be highly sensitive to changes in the prices of those services. According to consultancy firm Simon-Kucher, 50% of users across streaming platforms would cancel their subscriptions if prices were to increase by up to 30%.So, if the cost of streaming rises further, strong print book sales may become more common as consumers switch to a cheaper form of entertainment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

130,60bc49b7-def3-31d5-8adf-2d5176a100a6,PSX,2023-06-01,3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Energy Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-gain-despite-124900857.html,1685537340,STORY,"['MPC', 'PSX', 'EOG']","[Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC,EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at close to $70 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. MPC is well poised to gain on strong refining fundamentals, backed by the reduction in refining capacity across the world.

President Joe Biden has urged Congress to pass a deal to raise the government's borrowing limit. On the brighter side, artificial intelligence stocks’ gains in recent times, mostly driven by Nvidia's powerful sales guidance, are likely to have kept the U.S. equity market buoyant. Against this backdrop, a prudent investor is likely to look at stocks that are less burdened with debt instead of focusing on only their historical growth trend. To this end, we recommend stocks like Atmos Energy ATO, The TJX Companies TJX, Linde PLC LIN, Terex Corp TEX and Kinsale Capital Group KNSL, which bear low leverage. These can therefore shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter earnings cycle almost in its last lap, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the six stocks that made it through the screen.Atmos Energy: It is engaged in regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. On May 3, the company released its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results.

Dollar General, which caters to low income shoppers, also cut its annual sales and profit outlook on Thursday as consumers turn more cautious.Dollar General said it saw sales growth in groceries and other necessities, but that was offset by declines in seasonal items, home, and apparel.The economic challenges are starting to affect the wealthy, too.Nordstrom on Wednesday reported a surprise profit in the first quarter despite an 11% sales decline, and said that its wealthy shoppers are becoming more restrained. That's forced the Seattle-based company to take a conservative approach to inventory.“They’re pretty resilient, but they’re also cautious,” Nordstrom CEO Erik Nordstrom told analysts during its earnings call.Last week, Costco Wholesale Corp.'s Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti noted that customers are trading down from beef to poultry and pork in recent months. The chain, which caters to high-income shoppers, noted that they are even switching to some canned food, like chicken and tuna.Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, reported surging sales earlier last month, and noted that it's seeing an influx of wealthier shoppers trade down to the discount chain in search of low prices in the grocery aisle.Vivek Astvansh, an Indiana University marketing professor, noted the cumulative effect of high inflation and interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive, is taking a toll on shoppers.Story continues“There's this overall sense of hopeless, less confidence about the future,” Astvansh said.Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told analysts on Thursday that sales started to weaken in late March and then worsen in April. Gennette cited cooler-than-normal temperatures that made spring clothing less appealing. He noted headlines surrounding the banking crisis starting in mid-March also worried shoppers and said the compounding effect of inflation has made shoppers divert more of their money to food, essentials and services.The decline was most pronounced at its Macy's stores, which has the largest exposure to the lower to middle income shopper with roughly 50% of its customers with average household income of $75,000 or under, Gennette said.“Our customer became increasingly more deliberate in how they are allocating discretionary spend and buying closer to need,” Gennette told analysts.On the flip side, less-discretionary and less weather-dependent areas like fragrances, women's career sportswear and men's tailored items did well. He also noted a comeback in pandemic-related areas including housewares, which he believes is encouraging.The company’s luxury nameplates Bloomingdale’s and beauty chain Bluemercury were also affected by the increasingly difficult economic environment but not to the same intensity as Macy’s, Gennette noted.Business improved slightly in May at Macy's stores, but sales enjoyed a more dramatic rebound at Bloomingdales, Gennette said. He noted during a phone interview with The Associated Press he wasn't sure the difference reflected a split of the higher income consumer versus the lower income shopper or different offerings in fashion.“We haven’t heard the answer to that yet, and we need more time on that,” he said.Macy's Inc. reported net income of $155 million, or 56 cents per share, above the 45 cents Wall Street was looking for, but a significant decline from the $286 million earned during the same period last year.Sales fell to $5.17 billion from $5.56 billion in the first quarter last year, missing analyst projections.Comparable sales — sales coming from digital channels and stores opened at least a year — fell 7.2% across all categories including licensed businesses like cosmetics.“We have moved quickly to take the appropriate actions to meet current consumer demand and manage our expenses,” Gennette said in a written statement.The revised guidance reflected clearance markdowns on spring seasonal merchandise in the second quarter and cuts in inventory to adjust to the consumer slowdown, Gennette said.The company now expects earnings in the range of $2.70 to $3.20 per share for the year, down from previous guidance of between $3.67 and $4.11 per share. The company anticipates sales to be in the range of $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion this year, down from the previous range of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion.Analysts were expecting earnings of $3.69 per share on revenue of $23.73 billion.Shares tumbled during premarket trading but recovered in the afternoon, gaining more than 2% to $13.90.___A previous version of this story listed Macy’s reported net income for the first quarter as $155 billion. The correct figure is $155 million.___Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio]"

(NYSE:TSN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$40.5mUS$740.3mUS$1.86bUS$1.66bUS$1.55bUS$1.49bUS$1.46bUS$1.45bUS$1.45bUS$1.46bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -6.49%Est @ -3.91%Est @ -2.10%Est @ -0.84%Est @ 0.04%Est @ 0.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% -US$37.9US$648US$1.5kUS$1.3kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$919US$852US$798US$752(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.8bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$31bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$31b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$50.6, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Tyson Foods as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Tyson FoodsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Most food producers are suffering higher input costs such as livestock, grain and feed as well as labor and supply chain issues. However, its hard to pass on those costs through price increases as it may affect consumer demand. Usually, investors like to think of food as a recession-proof industry, but for some reason, that's turning out not to be the case this time around, at least in the U.S.TSN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSNPeter Lynch Chart of TSNTyson Foods Inc. (NYSE:TSN), one of the largest producers of beef, chicken and pork products in the U.S., recently suffered a surprising quarterly loss because of these issues. Tyson is an industry leader in key food proteins. Founded in 1935, the company has a broad portfolio of products and brands which includeTyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Wright, Aidells and State Fair. Headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, the company employs over 142,000 people. Tyson expects to generate over $53 billion in revenues this fiscal year and currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion.Protein marketAccording to Food Business News, U.S. consumers can anticipate greater availability of pork, chicken and turkey, but less beef, going forward. Cattle inventory has declined largely due to the closure of meat processing plants due to Covid-19 related disruptions. Drought conditions also caused a decrease in the total herd size because farmers were selling cows earlier than normal. Abnormal drought continues to affect several leading cattle states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.Consumer demand in the U.S. for beef, pork and chicken was strong before the onset of the pandemic but became even stronger as consumers stayed home and cooked more. Beef was the biggest winner, as consumers cooked meat more frequently as a substitute for restaurant visits. One would think that would contribute to support for higher prices, but alas for Tyson investors, things aren't that simple.Story continuesRecent earningsFor its second quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on April 1, Tyson reported disappointing results which were below expectations. Sales were $13.1 billion, which were roughly flat compared to the prior year period. The beef segment is having a difficult year with sales declining 8.2% in the quarter. In the pork segment, revenues declined 9.2% due to weaker pork prices, largely due to a glut of pigs in the market.Operating income was crushed and turned to a loss of $49 million, or a gain of $65 million on an adjusted basis which excludes extraordinary items. The company indicated that that substantial majority of the decline in operating income was driven by lower earnings in the beef and chicken segments. Higher input costs such as grain and feed as well as higher labor costs are hurting margins for the company.The companys balance sheet remains reasonably safe with cash of $543 million and long-term debt of $7.9 billion. Working capital was positive at $3.5 billion. The leverage ratio is slightly elevated at 3.2 due to depressed levels of Ebitda this year, but should drop significantly in 2024 as margins return to normal.ValuationDue to difficult operating conditions, Tyson expects its earnings will be depressed in the fiscal year ending September 2023. Analysts' earnings per share estimates for the fiscal year of 2023 are $1.67, which is a significant decline from the $8.92 reported in fiscal year 2022.As margins start their climb back to normal in the 2024 fiscal year, analysts' EPS estimates increase to $3.54, which provides a more reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of approximately 14.The GuruFocus DCF calculator provides a fair value close to the stock price as of this writing (which is $51.33) when I plug in analysts' average 2024 EPS estimate, as well as a discount rate of 10% and a 10-year growth rate of 7.6%. However, that is my worst-case scenario. The past two years have seen EPS in the $8.00-$9.00 range and the two years prior to that saw EPS in the $5.00-$6.00 range.The company currently pays an annualized dividend of $1.92, which equates to a 3.69% dividend yield. The payout ratio is over 100% currently, but should fall well below that level in coming years as the company recovers.The average price target for the eight analysts that cover the company on Wall Street is $53.75 with a high of $64.00 and a low of $48.00.Guru tradesAccording to the latest round of 13F reports, gurus who have purchased Tyson stock recently include Tom Gayner (Trades, Portfolio) and Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio).Investors should be aware that 13F reports do not provide a complete picture of a gurus holdings. They include only a snapshot of long equity positions in U.S.-listed stocks and American depository receipts as of the quarters end. They do not include short positions, non-ADR international holdings or other types of securities. However, even this limited filing can provide valuable information.SummaryDemand for key protein meats such as beef, pork and chicken by consumers still remains strong, even if pricing is struggling. Tyson has been experiencing difficulties as it finds itself unable to hike prices in line with the cost inflation it is experiencing.However, with a history going back 88 years, Tyson has certainly seen its share of commodity cycles as well as economic cycles. It has typically come out stronger when the cycles eventually turn.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

We are actively working within our Company and externally to create more equitable opportunities for women and people of color in innovation.We are a founding partner of Invent Together, a campaign supported by organizations, universities, companies and other stakeholders that are dedicated to understanding the gender, race, income and other diversity gaps in invention and patenting and supporting public policy and private efforts to close them. With Invent Together, we are advocating for greater study of historical exclusion from patenting and for policies and programs aimed at making patent-heavy STEM fields more inclusive. For example, we advocated for passage of the Inventor Diversity for Economic Advancement (IDEA) Act, which would direct the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to collect inventors' demographic data on a voluntary basis and make this information available in the aggregate for research.The story of engineering breakthroughs by our Company is a case study for how the U.S. patent system helps inventors get their ideas into the marketplace, while funding future risk-taking and innovation. This story helps explain why we have long championed support for strong IP rights as a foundation for future inventors of all backgrounds and why, in 2022, we partnered with Invent Together on the launch of TIPA.TIPA, which formally launched during the summer, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent - particularly potential inventors with backgrounds that provide them little or no exposure to the world of IP. The educational modules of TIPA are designed to show potential patentees what they can gain from patenting their invention and what the process looks like from the inventor's point of view.Story continuesMost importantly, the free course aims to make patenting more accessible for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQ+, people from lower-income communities and people with disabilities.We have long championed strong patent rights because we know the personal, national and global transformative power they bring. In developing TIPA, we were motivated by the belief that everyone can invent, that every inventor can learn to patent and that strong patent rights empower individual inventors to transform the world in ways that benefit us all.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportQualcomm, Wednesday, May 31, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758293/Fostering-a-More-Inclusive-Patent-Ecosystem-for-All-Inventors]"
164,0c260030-2bdf-3106-9a31-ef34eabc8d30,LMT,2023-06-01,"With 76% ownership, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/76-ownership-lockheed-martin-corporation-120021518.html,1685620821,STORY,['LMT'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Lockheed Martin's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders have been selling lately If you want to know who really controls Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Lockheed Martin already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Lockheed Martin is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 6.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Lockheed Martin Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$92m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Lockheed Martin. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

To skip our detailed analysis and head directly to the world’s best militaries, go to the 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023.A lot has happened over the last couple of years. Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban. Azerbaijan has seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control. Regular military skirmishes between China and India are reported in the bordering regions of Ladakh and Aksai Chin. Worst of all, Russia’s war on Ukraine has now gone past 450 days with no end in sight. These events have forced defense experts to dive deeper into the changing dynamics of modern warfare.Determinants of Military StrengthResults in recent conflicts have shown that having a big military is not alone the most significant criteria to gauge a military’s strength. Manpower, logistics, fleet size and sophistication of tanks, aircrafts, fighter jets, and naval warships are just as important determinants. Other key factors include the professionalism of soldiers, training level of pilots, battle hardness of the armed forces, and arms manufacturing capabilities of the nation. Nuclear deterrence is another key competitive edge that some countries hold over others. This deterrence is based on the assumption that another country will avoid escalating a war to protect its own security. There are geographic advantages as well in the war theater. The United States has over 750 overseas military bases across more than 80 countries, which gives them the capability to conduct raids against enemy targets anywhere in the world.Defense IndustryCurrently, the U.S. alone accounts for nearly 40% of the defense spending worldwide. China, Russia, and countries in the Middle East are also heavily spending billions of dollars on military expenditure per annum. Global military spending increased from $1,139 billion in 2001 to $2,113 billion in 2021 – a rise of nearly 50% in two decades. A report released by the Statista Research Department declared Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as the largest armament manufacturer in the world in 2021. The American company recorded revenue worth $65 billion from defense related sales that year. The top five leading armament manufacturers in the list were all American companies. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second, with defense sales revenue of over $41 billion. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) took third spot with $35 billion in revenue. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) were listed fourth and fifth, with defense revenues of $31.5 billion and $30.8 billion respectively. Aviation Industry Corporation of China was the largest armament manufacturer outside of the U.S., recording $42 billion in revenue.Story continuesMilitary Technology FrontiersThe U.S. continues to maintain air superiority over Russia and China due its fifth-generation fighter jets. These jets include major technologies developed during the 21st century, such as “stealth” which differentiates them from previous generations of jets. These new and advanced fighter jets come with special paint and other features which make it hard for the enemy radars to detect them. In 2005, the U.S. became the first country to launch a fifth-generation fighter jet, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. The F-35B Lightening II was introduced in 2015 by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to give the U.S. further edge in aerial battles. Russia, with Su-57, and China with its J-20 are other countries that have their own fifth-generation fighter jets. Japan, India, Turkey, and Sweden are currently undergoing initiatives to develop their own fifth-generation fighter jets.Another key military frontier in recent times has been hypersonic weapons which evade advanced radar systems and travel in the upper atmosphere at about 6,200 km per hour - more than five times the speed of sound. There are two types of hypersonic missiles - the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) and hypersonic cruise missile (HCM).The former has the ability to leave Earth's atmosphere and then plunge back into it. On the other hand, the HCM travels at lightening speed at low levels and can also carry a nuclear warhead. Russia is leading the arms race in hypersonic military technology, and is believed to have at least 42 hypersonic missiles known as Kinzhal, as per the Ukrainian military. The U.S. is also pursuing development of hypersonic weapons. According to a report, the U.S. Department of Defense set aside $3.2 billion in 2021 in R&amp;D financing for hypersonic weapons. China, the UK, and Israel have also conducted basic research on hypersonic military technology alongside other countries.MethodologyWe have considered a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics to rank the best militaries in the world. The quantitative metrics include gross domestic product (GDP) and defense spending of countries in the year 2022, number of active military personnel in service, fleet size of combat tanks, nuclear warheads, number of fighter jets and naval vessels, active airfields, military satellites, overseas military bases, and cyber capability. Weights have been assigned to each metric and aggregated to determine the rank of strength for each military. Qualitatively, factors such as combat experience, and recognized professionalism and training of active military personnel have been considered. These are important factors because in the last decade or so, new players have emerged as top spenders on military expenditure, but their manpower lacks the required level of experience and expertise to handle sophisticated equipment. Some of the prominent metrics in our weightings have also been highlighted in the list.Statistics and analysis from a wide range of sources have been carefully studied for preparing this list. These include Janes, Global Firepower Index of 2023, Flight International, Belfar Center's National Cyber Security Index of 2022 (which measures countries' cyber capability on a scale of 1-100), The Power Atlas, and various media publications.25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023NEstudio/Shutterstock.comHere are the 25 most powerful militaries in the world in 2023.25. ThailandGDP: $524 billionDefense spending: $6.3 billionManpower: 350,000Tanks: 587Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 469Naval vessels: 292Thailand’s defense expenditure has grown over the years, and has been driven by factors such as external security threats, modernization program, and arms race in the neighborhood. Since 2006, ASEAN member countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia have more than doubled their military spending due to regional disputes, such as in the South China Sea.24. CanadaGDP: $2,140 billionDefense spending: $36.3 billionManpower: 70,000Tanks: 82Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 380Naval vessels: 61With over $36 billion in defense spending in 2022, Canada is emerging as a major military strength. In January, 2023, the government announced it was buying 88 F-35 stealth fifth-generation fighter jets, developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), in a bid to enhance Arctic security and meet NATO spending obligations. Canada has an active military manpower of 70,000 with 82 tanks and 61 naval vessels. It also has 1,467 airfields which are testament of Canada’s logistical capabilities.23. NetherlandsGDP: $1,020 billionDefense spending: $13.7 billionManpower: 35,000Tanks: 18Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 156Naval vessels: 61Netherlands finds its place among the top militaries in the world in 2023 primarily due to investments in air power. It currently has a fleet of 156 military aircraft, including 40 F-16 and 13 F-35 fighter jets. Its combat tanks are only 18, and that is because in 2011, the Dutch government, as a cost-cutting measure, eliminated its entire force of 60 tanks. However, a GDP now of over $1 trillion allows the Dutch government to spend and raise its tanks fleet again.22. AustraliaGDP: $1,700 billionDefense spending: $30 billionManpower: 60,500Tanks: 59Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 430Naval vessels: 43In May 2023, Australia proposed a defense budget of $30 billion, and announced to purchase nuclear submarines, the SSN-AUKUS, as part of a three-way agreement involving Australia, the UK, and the U.S. The fleet size of Australia’s military purpose aircrafts stands at 430, which also includes 37 F-35A fighter jets. An order for 72 more of these fifth-generation fighter jets has been placed with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). With a tank fleet of 59 and active military personnel of over 60,000, Australia finds its place among the 25 most powerful militaries in 2023.21. EgyptGDP: $475 billionDefense spending: $4.35 billionManpower: 440,000Tanks: 4,664Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 1,062Naval vessels: 245Egypt is another powerful country on the list from the MENA region. It has an active military manpower of 440,000, with over 4,000 tanks, more than 1,000 aircrafts and fighter jets, and 245 naval assets. The country receives military assistance worth $1.3 billion per year from the United States to facilitate the transition from outdated Soviet era equipment. Egypt has a fleet of 168 F-16 fourth-generation fighter jets, and is purchasing 30 units of Rafale jets and 12 CH-47F Chinooks to further boost its air force capabilities. Sisi’s government has increased defense expenditure amid ongoing terrorism in the Sinai peninsula and instability in Libya. Under a contract between the United States and Egypt, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) will provide sustainment and technical support to Egypt’s E-2 aircrafts.20. IranGDP: $368 billionDefense spending: $5.5 billionManpower: 575,000Tanks: 4,071Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 543Naval vessels: 101Much of Iran’s military strength is owed to its manpower and combat tanks fleet. Global sanctions have impeded the country’s economic growth and subsequently its ability to upgrade its air and naval power. The country ranks amongst the lowest in both cyber security and space presence. However, despite these challenges, Iran makes the list due to the battle-hardness and strength of its ground forces as well as its ICBM arsenal.19. IndonesiaGDP: $1,200 billionDefense spending: $8.8 billionManpower: 400,000Tanks: 314Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 461Naval vessels: 324Indonesia is next on the list.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:Through the morning session of May 24th, we have seen Q1 results from 489 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.8% of the index’s membership. Total Q1 earnings for these companies are down -3.7% on +4.4% higher revenues, with 78.1% beating EPS estimates and 74.6% beating revenue estimates.In terms of earnings growth, 2023 Q1 earnings were below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Basic Materials (-29.4%), Construction (-19.1%), Medical (-17.7%), Conglomerates (-9.2%), Technology (-11.7%), and Consumer Staples (-2.2%) having notable declines.Sectors enjoying positive earnings growth in 2023 Q1 include Transportation (+56.9%), Consumer Discretionary (+31.2%), Aerospace (+15.7%), Energy (+15.5%), Finance (+1.4%), Retail (+3.1%), Autos (+10.4%), Business Services (+2.1%), and Industrial Products (+17.0%).For 2023 Q2, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are now expected to be down -9% on -0.6% lower revenues. This is down from the expected earnings and revenue declines of -7.2% and -0.5%, respectively, on March 29th.The earnings picture defied the skeptics again in the 2023 Q1 earnings season, with companies not only handily beating estimates but also providing reassuring enough guidance for the current coming quarters.Story continuesWe are not suggesting that earnings are great, because they are not. After all, earnings growth is on track to be negative for the second quarter in a row, with the trend of declining profits expected to continue in the current period (2023 Q2) as well as the one after that.We tend to dwell a lot on the Technology and Finance sectors as we look for earnings trends in the aggregate, as these two sectors combined account for so much of the total earnings pie. Over the coming four quarters, these two sectors are expected to bring in 44% of all S&amp;P 500 earnings. As such, what happens in these two sectors significantly impacts the aggregate growth picture.The focus of today’s report is to feature the earnings outlook of the Zacks Construction sector, one of the stand-alone Zacks economic sectors that we feel differentiates us from the conventional sector classification (we have 16 sectors vs. the 11 sectors in the ‘standard’ system).As an interest rate-sensitive sector, the Construction sector’s profitability has been significantly affected by higher interest rates as a result of Fed tightening. The sector’s earnings this year are currently expected to decline by -21.8%, which would follow earnings growth of +21.5% in 2022, +45% in 2021, and +24.5% in 2020.But as you can see in this chart, the sector’s profitability outlook is not only stable but actually positive. This favorable earnings outlook also comes through when we look at the sector’s earnings estimate revisions trend, which turned positive recently after remaining negative since April 2022.In fact, 2023 earnings estimates for the sector got cut the most out of all Zacks sectors as the full extent of the Fed’s tightening cycle took hold last year. From their peak in April last year, 2023 earnings estimates for the Zacks Construction sector have been cut by almost -27%.The Construction sector was hardly alone in experiencing this negative revisions trend, as estimates for most sectors adjusted lower over this time period.However, the Construction sector has been notably experiencing a trend reversal lately, with estimates for the group notably moving higher since the start of April 2023.You can see this recent favorable turn in the revisions trend by looking at the individual companies in the Zacks Construction sector, of which the 12 that are in the S&amp;P 500 index are listed in the bottom left of the chart above. Take, for example, homebuilders D.R. Horton DHI, PulteGroup PHM and NVR NVR.D.R. Horton is currently expected to bring in $11.18 per share this year on $32.3 billion in revenues. The current $11.18 per share estimate is up +23.2% since March 31st.As you can see in the D.R. Horton chart above, current estimates are down significantly relative to where they stood a year ago, but they are nevertheless starting to trend up. We see the same trend at play with PulteGroup, NVR, and others.Using PulteGroup as an example, the current estimate for 2023 of $9.05 per share is up +21.6% since March 31st, while the same for NVR is up +7.4% over the same time period.Knowing this recent favorable turn in the group’s earnings estimate revisions trend puts the group’s stock market outperformance in the correct context.The Earnings Big PictureAs we have pointed out all along, aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 peaked in April last year and consistently came down since then. Even accounting for the aforementioned favorable revisions trend in recent weeks, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates have declined by -13.2% since the April 2022 peak and -14.6% on an ex-Energy basis.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

170,3f10e2ba-ac10-3f4f-9975-31383f1528fa,PHM,2023-06-01,Quanta Services (PWR) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-services-pwr-hits-52-154600287.html,1685547960,STORY,"['PWR', 'MTH', 'NVR', 'PHM']","[Quanta Services, Inc. PWR crafts a new 52-week high of $181.83 on May 30, 2023. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $181.17.Notably, Quanta has gained 27.1% year to date, faring better than the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry and Zacks Construction sector’s 8.1% and 12.7% rallies, respectively. The stock has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.6% rise.The price surge was probably due to the news related to the debt ceiling bill. Notably, on May 30, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office said that it expects the debt-ceiling deal, agreed by House Republicans and President Joe Biden, will reduce budget deficits by about $1.5 trillion between 2023 and 2033. Although there will be a decline in discretionary outlays in the amount of $1.3 trillion over the 2024–2033 period, the bill will accelerate the permitting process for some energy projects. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Meanwhile, Quanta continues to experience high demand for its infrastructure solutions that support energy-transition initiatives and increase reliability, safety and efficiency. Notably, project activity associated with renewable generation has been going strong and is expected to continue throughout the year.Also, prospects of the Electric Power segment of Quanta remain robust, given customers’ investment in grid modernization programs intended to address the aging infrastructure, strengthen systems for resiliency against extreme weather conditions and support long-term economic growth. Quanta expects to generate $900 million of revenues from communication services, included in this segment, in 2023. It expects the operating income margin for the Electric Power segment, which has been dilutive to segment margins in the prior periods, to be within 10.7%-11.3% on a full-year basis.Quanta remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is vulnerable to supply-chain disruptions, regulatory challenges, and risks like project delays and stiff competition. Also, lower operating margins are concerning.Story continues3 Better-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging in the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the Construction sector, are:Meritage Homes Corporation MTH: Meritage Homes’ strategic shift to a pure-play entry-level and first-move-up builder is expected to yield higher absorptions, aided by an improving community count growth trajectory.Meritage Homes currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

171,92737755-0270-3b4a-a78e-e00713534084,PHM,2023-06-01,Brokers Suggest Investing in PulteGroup (PHM): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-pultegroup-phm-133007005.html,1685539807,STORY,['PHM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in PHM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $9.05.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 9.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WEC Energy due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.WEC Energy Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Sales LagWEC Energy Group reported first-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 by 1.26%. However, the bottom line declined 10.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.79.RevenuesOperating revenues of $2,888.1 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,916 million by around 0.97%. The top line also declined 0.69% from $2,908.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Highlights of the ReleaseElectricity consumption by small commercial and industrial customers declined 3.4% year over year. The same for large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mine, decreased 3.9% on a year-over-year basis.On a weather-normal basis, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, declined 1.9%.Total operating expenses amounted to $2,218.8 million, up 16.2% from the year-ago quarter’s $2,176.7 million.  This was due to higher operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation &amp; amortization costs, and property and revenue taxes.Operating income was $669.3 million, down 8.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $731.4 million.The company incurred an interest expense of $172.2 million, up 46.4% from the prior-year quarter’s $117.6 million.Financial PositionAs of Mar 31, 2023, WEC had cash and cash equivalents of $35.7 million compared with $28.9 million as of Dec 31, 2022.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had a long-term debt of $15,827.3 million compared with $14,766.2 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities during first three months of 2023 was $796.1 million compared with $1,076.8 million in the year-ago period.Story continuesGuidanceWEC Energy Group reaffirmed 2023 earnings guidance in the range of $4.58-$4.62 per share. The midpoint of the range, $4.60 per share, is on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -11.84% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, WEC Energy has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D.

The large drugmakers are doing well, proving their resilience against recession, and are expected to remain strong.Overall, innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry in 2023. M&amp;A deals are also picking up, which shows growth. New drug launches and positive pipeline readouts are expected to keep investor focus on the sector. Among the large drugmakers, Eli Lilly, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novo Nordisk, Roche and Novartis are worth retaining in your portfolio.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices and consumer healthcare products.All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drug companies.What's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry?Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&amp;D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.Story continuesAggressive M&amp;A &amp; Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.Also, the sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&amp;A appetite of large drugmakers. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&amp;A activities. Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.In less than half a year, two big acquisition announcements have already been made. Amgen has offered to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion while Pfizer has offered to buy cancer drugmaker, Seagen, for approximately $43 billion. However, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to block the Amgen/Horizon Therapeutics deal as it believes the merger poses competitive issues.Pipeline Setbacks &amp; Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs.Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Higher interest rates, inflationary pressure from rising energy prices, significant economic volatility, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #102, which places it in the top 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 but outperformed the Zacks Medical Sector this year so far.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 0.8% this year so far against the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s increase of 10.6%. The Zacks Medical Sector has declined 5.2%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.94X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.76X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 21.99X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.63X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 14.98X.5 Large Drugmakers to Keep an Eye OnRoche: It has a strong presence in the oncology market. In particular, the company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs.Roche’s new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Tecentriq (cancer) are doing well, making up for the declining demand for Roche’s COVID-19 products. The uptake of the new eye drug, Vabysmo (launched at the beginning of 2022) has been outstanding and it is already one of the top growth drivers for the company. Roche’s efforts to develop new drugs to combat the decline in legacy drugs are encouraging.Roche has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has risen from $2.61 per share to $2.67 while that for 2024 has jumped from $2.83 per share to $2.89 over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 1.8% this year so far.Novartis: It has a strong and diverse portfolio. Solid momentum in key brands like Entresto, Kesimpta, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio is fueling Novartis’ growth, offsetting the impact of rising generic competition. The pipeline progress is also impressive. The company has some promising candidates. Management’s focus on cost savings should boost the bottom line as well. The planned spin-off of the Sandoz unit remains on track for the second half of 2023. The spin-off will allow Novartis to focus on its core pharma business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has risen from $6.56 per share to $6.67 while that for 2024 has jumped from $7.05 per share to $7.22 over the past 60 days. Novartis is a #2 Ranked stock. This Swiss drugmaker’s stock has risen 6.4% this year so far.Novo Nordisk: It has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry, with an extensive portfolio of insulin drugs and diabetes-related products. Semaglutide remains the growth engine for the company. It is approved as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy for weight management. Ozempic, Rybelsus, Xultophy and Saxenda have been helping the company maintain momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to further boost sales. Novo Nordisk has also significantly stepped up its M&amp;A activity in the past two years.Novo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Estimates for its 2023 earnings per share have increased from $4.48 to $5.07 over the past 60 days. Estimates for 2024 have jumped from $5.28 per share to $5.91 over the same timeframe. The stock has surged 18.1% this year so far.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly: It boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs in diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched.Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is already generating impressive sales, benefiting from strong demand trends. It is expected to be a key long-term top-line driver for Lilly as it has the potential to be approved for obesity and other diabetes-related diseases. Lilly expects the launch of mirikizumab, lebrikizumab and tirzepatide for obesity later in 2023.Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lilly’s 2023 EPS has risen from $8.49 per share to $8.79 over the past 60 days while that for 2024 has increased from $11.58 per share to $12.08. The stock has risen 16.8% this year so far.Johnson &amp; Johnson: Its Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels. Growth in 2023 is expected to be driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake from new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions and has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigation.J&amp;J has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this large drugmaker’s 2023 EPS has risen from $10.50 per share to $10.66 over the past 60 days while that for 2024 has jumped from $10.94 per share to $11.01. The stock has declined 12.6% this year so far.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The large drugmakers are doing well, proving their resilience against recession, and are expected to remain strong.Overall, innovation is likely to drive growth in the industry in 2023. M&amp;A deals are also picking up, which shows growth. New drug launches and positive pipeline readouts are expected to keep investor focus on the sector. Among the large drugmakers, Eli Lilly LLY, J&amp;J JNJ, Novo Nordisk NVO, Roche RHHBY and Novartis NVS are worth retaining in your portfolio.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that developmulti-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these companies also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices and consumer healthcare products. All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers and acquisitions and collaboration deals are other key features of large drug companies.What's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry? Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significantly high portion of their revenues on R&amp;D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.Aggressive M&amp;A &amp; Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Also, the sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&amp;A appetite of large drugmakers. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&amp;A activities. Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing. In less than half the year, two big acquisition announcements have already been made. Amgen has offered to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion while Pfizer has offered to buy cancer drugmaker, Seagen, for approximately $43 billion. However, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to block the Amgen/Horizon Therapeutics deal as it believes the merger poses competitive issues.Pipeline Setbacks &amp; Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs.Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Higher interest rates, inflationary pressure from rising energy prices, significant economic volatility, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industryis a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #102, which places it in the top 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 but outperformed the Zacks Medical Sector this year so far.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 0.8% this year so far against the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s increase of 10.6%. The Zacks Medical Sector has declined 5.2%.Year-to-Date Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.94X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.76X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 21.99X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.63X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 14.98X, as the chart below shows. Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio5 Large Drugmakers to Keep an Eye OnRoche: It has a strong presence in the oncology market. In particular, the company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs.Roche’s new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy) and Tecentriq (cancer) are doing well, making up for the declining demand for Roche’s COVID-19 products. The uptake of the new eye drug, Vabysmo (launched at the beginning of 2022) has been outstanding and it is already one of the top growth drivers for the company. Roche’s efforts to develop new drugs to combat the decline in legacy drugs are encouraging.Roche has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has risen from $2.61 per share to $2.67 while that for 2024 has jumped from $2.83 per share to $2.89 over the past 60 days.

Solid momentum in key brands like Entresto, Kesimpta, Zolgensma, Kisqali and Leqvio is fueling Novartis’ growth, offsetting the impact of rising generic competition. The pipeline progress is also impressive. The company has some promising candidates. Management’s focus on cost savings should boost the bottom line as well. The planned spin-off of the Sandoz unit remains on track for the second half of 2023. The spin-off will allow Novartis to focus on its core pharma business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS has risen from $6.56 per share to $6.67 while that for 2024 has jumped from $7.05 per share to $7.22 over the past 60 days.

Semaglutide remains the growth engine for the company. It is approved as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy for weight management. Ozempic, Rybelsus, Xultophy and Saxenda have been helping the company maintain momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to further boost sales.

Estimates for its 2023 earnings per share have increased from $4.48 to $5.07 over the past 60 days. Estimates for 2024 have jumped from $5.28 per share to $5.91 over the same timeframe.

Price and Consensus: NVO Eli Lilly: It boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs in diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes and cancer drug Jaypirca already launched. Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is already generating impressive sales, benefiting from strong demand trends. It is expected to be a key long-term top-line driver for Lilly as it has the potential to be approved for obesity and other diabetes-related diseases. Lilly expects the launch of mirikizumab, lebrikizumab and tirzepatide for obesity later in 2023.Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lilly’s 2023 EPS has risen from $8.49 per share to $8.79 over the past 60 days while that for 2024 has increased from $11.58 per share to $12.08. The stock has risen 16.8% this year so far.Price and Consensus: LLY Johnson &amp; Johnson: Its Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels. Growth in 2023 is expected to be driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya, Erleada, Invega Sustenna and Uptravi, and also continued uptake from new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. The MedTech unit is showing improving trends, driven by recovery in surgical procedures and contribution from new products.

188,0c205622-9f46-3148-a6bb-1c37389d33f9,RSG,2023-06-01,Investors in Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) have seen stellar returns of 126% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-republic-services-nyse-rsg-122624316.html,1685622384.0,STORY,['RSG'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG) share price has soared 108% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Republic Services There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Republic Services managed to grow its earnings per share at 3.9% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Republic Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Republic Services the TSR over the last 5 years was 126%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Republic Services has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.3% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 18% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

Patients should be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.This approval was based on an exploratory subgroup analysis of the Phase 3 PROpel trial which showed that LYNPARZA plus abi/pred demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in both radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (HR=0.24 [95% CI, 0.12-0.45]) and overall survival (OS) (HR=0.30 [95% CI, 0.15-0.59]) versus abi/pred alone in patients with BRCAm mCRPC. In the BRCAm subgroup (n=85), the median rPFS and OS were not reached (NR) in those receiving LYNPARZA plus abi/pred (95% CI, NR-NR for both rPFS and OS), compared to a median of eight months rPFS (95% CI, 6-15) and 23 months OS (95% CI, 18-34) in those receiving placebo plus abi/pred. As previously reported, there was a statistically significant improvement in rPFS in the full intention-to-treat (ITT) population in the PROpel trial (n=796). Based on exploratory analyses of rPFS and OS in the BRCAm and non-BRCAm subgroups (non-BRCA subgroup rPFS HR=0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.96]; non-BRCA subgroup OS HR=0.92 [95% CI, 0.74-1.14]), the FDA concluded that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results seen in the subgroup of patients with BRCAm.In the ITT population, the most common adverse reactions (ARs) in patients who received LYNPARZA plus abi/pred (≥10%) were anemia (48%), fatigue (38%), nausea (30%), diarrhea (19%), decreased appetite (16%), lymphopenia and dizziness (14% each) and abdominal pain (13%). Among patients who received LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred, 16% permanently discontinued treatment with LYNPARZA due to an AR, 48% had a dosage interruption of LYNPARZA and 21% had their dose of LYNPARZA reduced.Story continuesIn the U.S., prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, and despite an increase in the number of available therapies for patients with mCRPC, five-year survival remains low. Many patients with mCRPC are only able to receive one line of therapy, as the disease can progress quickly. Approximately 10% of patients with mCRPC will have BRCA mutations, which are associated with a poor prognosis and worse outcomes.Andrew Armstrong, MD, ScM, Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, N.C. and an investigator in the trial, said, ""Preventing or delaying radiographic progression is an important clinical endpoint in assessing cancer treatment and is very important to patients, their caregivers and their families. The PROpel results showed the LYNPARZA combination demonstrated a notable clinically meaningful benefit that should rapidly be considered as the standard of care treatment for patients with BRCAm mCRPC.""Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology business unit, AstraZeneca, said, ""There is a critical unmet need for new first-line treatment options for patients with BRCAm mCRPC, and this approval underscores the importance of BRCA testing at metastatic diagnosis. We look forward to bringing the benefit of this LYNPARZA combination to patients earlier in their treatment.""Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""It is imperative that we create new ways to treat advanced cancers and help improve patient outcomes by building on the current standard of care. In PROpel, the LYNPARZA combination improved rPFS and OS for the subgroup of patients with BRCAm mCRPC. This approval reinforces the importance of routine testing for genetic mutations at metastatic diagnosis to help guide clinical decisions.""The rPFS results from the ITT population of the Phase 3 PROpel trial were published in NEJM Evidence in June 2022.LYNPARZA plus abi/pred is approved in several other countries for the treatment of appropriate adult patients with mCRPC based on the PROpel trial. In the European Union (EU), LYNPARZA plus abi/pred is approved for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated, regardless of biomarker status.In the U.S., LYNPARZA was previously approved for patients with homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone, and in the EU, Japan and China for patients with BRCAm mCRPC who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent (NHA). These approvals were based on the data from the Phase 3 PROfound trial. For the U.S. indication, patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.About PROpelPROpel (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03732820) is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abi/pred in 796 patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or NHAs in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. Overall survival was an additional efficacy outcome measure. Exploratory subgroup analyses were subsequently conducted to assess efficacy in patients with BRCAm (n=85) and patients without identified BRCAm (n=711). BRCA-mutated status was assessed after randomization and before primary analysis by both next generation sequencing-based tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA tests. BRCA-mutated classification criteria in line with the FDA-approved assays were used to determine the deleterious and suspected deleterious somatic or germline mutation status of patients. BRCA was not a stratification factor in PROpel, and the BRCAm and non-BRCAm subgroup analyses were not controlled for Type 1 error.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. In the combined data of two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies (PROfound and PROpel) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N=1180), VTE occurred in 8% of patients who received LYNPARZA, including pulmonary embolism in 6%. In the control arms, VTE occurred in 2.5%, including pulmonary embolism in 1.5%. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%), and leukopenia (18%).

Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About BRCA mutationsBRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility genes 1/2) are human genes that produce proteins responsible for repairing damaged DNA and play an important role maintaining the genetic stability of cells. When either of these genes is mutated or altered such that its protein product either is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly, and cells become unstable. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to cancer.Approximately 10% of patients with mCRPC will have BRCA mutations, which are associated with a poor prognosis and worse outcomes.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types.

He added that China remains ""our friend, our customer,"" but business could proceed with ""fits and starts"" due to geopolitical tensions.Chinese airlines began returning the 737 MAX to service earlier this year. Although all Chinese users have restarted 737 flights, deliveries of the jet have been stalled amid friction between the United States and China.In April, the Chinese aviation regulator published a report on the 737, which was hailed by Calhoun at the time as an ""important step"" for restarting MAX deliveries after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people.Calhoun spoke to the press on Tuesday during a media tour at Boeing’s facilities in Charleston, South Carolina, where the company builds the widebody 787 Dreamliner.During the discussion – held several weeks before Boeing faces off against Airbus in the orders bonanza of Paris Air Show – Calhoun said the U.S. planemaker could fend off threats, including rival offerings and supply-chain snarls.Story continuesAs Airbus ponders whether to launch a stretched version of its A220 – a move that would challenge Boeing’s bestselling 737 MAX 8 - Calhoun replied: “That does not give me heartburn.”Calhoun said it was not important that Boeing regain a 50% market share for narrowbody plane orders against Airbus.Instead, Calhoun said the biggest driver of Boeing’s market share losses over the past four years was its inability to deliver airplanes, first due to the MAX crisis in 2019 which was followed by supply-chain and production issues.Calhoun also rejected speculation that Boeing could seek to re-acquire Spirit AeroSystems, a company spun off from Boeing in 2005 that produces major aircraft structures including the 737 MAX fuselage and forward fuselage of the 787, as well as key portions of aircraft made by Airbus.Spirit has been the source of several problems that have stalled Boeing deliveries in recent years, including an ongoing 737 MAX bracket installation flaw that slowed deliveries since it was discovered in April.“We are disappointed with every next issue that occurs that limits our rates and slows us down,” Calhoun said. However, those problems “are solvable, and I don't think you acquire a company to solve it.”(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Charleston, South Carolina; Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)]"

200,3ea3eadf-2a34-3881-8ba7-2dd571c6677c,BA,2023-06-01,"Pain and terror felt by passengers before Boeing Max crashed can be considered, judge rules",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pain-terror-felt-passengers-boeing-152940280.html,1685546980,STORY,['BA'],"[Families of passengers who died in the crash of a Boeing 737 Max in Ethiopia can seek damages for the pain and terror suffered by victims in the minutes before the plane flew nose-down into the ground, a federal judge has ruled.The ruling means that lawyers for the families will be able to call experts to testify about the victims' pain and suffering before the 2019 crash, which killed everyone on board.The ruling posted late Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Jorge Alonso in Chicago is a setback for Boeing, which had argued that evidence about the victims' suffering would be speculative.The decision comes in a case over compensation for the relatives of people who died in the second of two deadly crashes involving Boeing's best-selling plane. A trial is scheduled to begin June 20.Boeing has admitted responsibility for the deaths of the passengers and agreed not to blame the pilots or anyone else. In exchange, lawyers for the families agreed not to seek punitive damages against the company. The trial will determine compensation for things such as burial expenses, loss of income, and grief suffered by immediate family members.At a hearing last week, Boeing lawyers sought to block testimony about pain and suffering by passengers in the minutes before the crash. They said the testimony would be inflammatory and have an unfair impact on jurors.Boeing lawyers also said that Illinois law — in effect even though the case is being tried in federal court — bars compensatory damages for the passengers’ pain and suffering because they died the instant the plane hit the ground.Attorneys for the families say their clients can’t stop thinking about the terror their loved ones suffered as the plane repeatedly dove and climbed before entering a final nosedive at nearly 700 miles per hour. The attorneys want to call experts who would testify that the passengers likely suffered physical injuries and emotional trauma before the crash.Story continuesThere are bound to be further arguments over rules of the trial, including whether to call the crash an accident. One of the families' lawyers, Robert Clifford, said he wants to call the crater left by the crash a crime scene. Clifford said this week’s ruling will help families receive compensation for pain suffered by relatives “who needlessly died at the hands of a company that put profits over safety.”Asked for comment on the ruling, a Boeing spokeswoman referred to a previous statement in which Boeing said it was sorry for all who lost loved ones in the two crashes. The company said it has kept a commitment to settle “to fully and fairly compensate every family who suffered a loss” by settling most of the claims, and will continue negotiating over the remaining claims.In 2021, Boeing reached a settlement with the Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecution for misleading federal regulators who approved the Max by hiding details of a flight-control system implicated in the crashes. The company received a $244 million fine and agreed to pay compensation to airlines and victims, raising the cost of the deal to $2.5 billion.In all, 346 people died in the two crashes involving Max jets shortly after airlines around the world began using the planes. In October 2018, a Lion Air Max crashed in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. Less than five months later, in March 2019, an Ethiopian Airlines Max carrying 149 passengers and eight crew members crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa.Boeing has settled with most families of people on board the Lion Air jet and many of those on the Ethiopian plane, but lawyers say about 75 cases remain open, and six will be included in the upcoming trial in federal court in Chicago.Boeing is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, but it was based in Chicago when the first lawsuits were filed in 2019.]"

ILMN recently announced the latest data on the impact of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) on oncology patients. The data will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting in Chicago, to be held on Jun 2-6.In addition to the real-world study data, Illumina will present findings that expose gaps in the current standard of care and unmet needs for cancer patients.Significance of CGPAs the number and complexity of targetable variants in advanced cancers have increased, CGP has become the standard of care. By collaborating with leaders in oncology, Illumina is set to present compelling real-world evidence that, which demonstrates improved survival in cancer patients who received CGP testing and targeted therapy compared to standard chemotherapy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite CGP being increasingly included in care guidelines, its inconsistent application creates a major gap in the standard-of-care practice for advanced cancer. To understand the benefits of more consistent use of CGP, Providence, a not-for-profit health system serving the Western United States, implemented a reflex testing protocol where CGP was routinely ordered by pathologists at the time of diagnosis for advanced cancer patients. The study abstract will be presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting.Illumina will also present two posters illustrating gaps in the current testing practices and a study indicating that a large percentage of cancer patients who are eligible for biomarker testing are not receiving any genomic testing whatsoever.Small-panel genomic assays that test key cancer-related biomarkers remain part of routine care in oncology in some regions. However, a descriptive analysis of the guideline found that nearly all commercially available small panels miss at least one biomarker recommended in the clinical practice guideline.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global genomics market size was valued at $28.1 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.5% up to 2030.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsEarlier in April 2023, Illumina and the Detroit-based not-for-profit healthcare organization Henry Ford Health, announced a partnership to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing on cardiovascular diseases.

PWR crafts a new 52-week high of $181.83 on May 30, 2023. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $181.17.Notably, Quanta has gained 27.1% year to date, faring better than the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry and Zacks Construction sector’s 8.1% and 12.7% rallies, respectively. The stock has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.6% rise.The price surge was probably due to the news related to the debt ceiling bill. Notably, on May 30, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office said that it expects the debt-ceiling deal, agreed by House Republicans and President Joe Biden, will reduce budget deficits by about $1.5 trillion between 2023 and 2033. Although there will be a decline in discretionary outlays in the amount of $1.3 trillion over the 2024–2033 period, the bill will accelerate the permitting process for some energy projects. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Meanwhile, Quanta continues to experience high demand for its infrastructure solutions that support energy-transition initiatives and increase reliability, safety and efficiency. Notably, project activity associated with renewable generation has been going strong and is expected to continue throughout the year.Also, prospects of the Electric Power segment of Quanta remain robust, given customers’ investment in grid modernization programs intended to address the aging infrastructure, strengthen systems for resiliency against extreme weather conditions and support long-term economic growth. Quanta expects to generate $900 million of revenues from communication services, included in this segment, in 2023. It expects the operating income margin for the Electric Power segment, which has been dilutive to segment margins in the prior periods, to be within 10.7%-11.3% on a full-year basis.Quanta remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is vulnerable to supply-chain disruptions, regulatory challenges, and risks like project delays and stiff competition.

(AP) — The first of two nuclear reactors in Georgia is generating electricity and could be days away from achieving full-power operation. But the new units at Georgia Power Co.'s Plant Vogtle are $17 billion over budget and running seven years late.Customers of multiple Georgia utilities are already paying billions, although state regulators haven't yet decided how much Georgia Power ratepayers will owe.Meanwhile, two of the same model reactors that were planned for different owners in South Carolina were abandoned partway through construction. There, federal prosecutors have pursued criminal charges against utility and construction executives, saying they illegally concealed delays and cost overruns.The projects were supposed to mark a rebirth for the U.S. nuclear industry, but construction proved difficult despite consistent federal support.Here's a timeline of the two nuclear projects:1970: Georgia Power Co., a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., decides to build four nuclear reactors along the Savannah River bordering South Carolina.1976: Construction resumes at the plant after two of four reactors are cancelled. It's named for Alvin W. Vogtle, then CEO of Southern Co. During World War II, Vogtle was a fighter pilot who was captured by German fighters and escaped from a prisoner of war camp on his fifth attempt.1989: Unit 2 finally goes online after Unit 1 entered service in 1987. Originally projected to cost $660 million, the two reactors eventually cost $8.9 billion.2001: Utilities including Southern Co., the parent of Georgia Power Co., meet with federal regulators to discuss ways to ease permitting for new nuclear power plants, in a push by President George W. Bush's administration.2004: Southern Co., three other utilities and three nuclear reactor designers including Westinghouse Electric Co. jointly apply for new reactor licenses.2005: Southern Co. announced that it's evaluating the Vogtle site for new reactors, saying it believes Georgia will need more electrical generation in the future.Story continues2006: Southern Co. picks Westinghouse's AP1000 reactor design and applies for an early site permit days after U.S. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman promises $2 billion in incentives for new reactors nationwide in a speech at Georgia Power headquarters.2007: The Georgia Public Service Commission says Georgia Power can build two new reactors at Vogtle, but only if finds no cheaper options. No competing generators offer bids for long-term contracts. Westinghouse signs a contract to build AP1000 reactors in China.2008: Southern Co. seeks a license for Vogtle from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. SCANA Corp. also asks to build two new reactors at the V.C. Summer plant near Columbia, South Carolina. Georgia Power asks public service commissioners to approve plans after co-owners Oglethorpe Power Corp., Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton join the project. The reactors are supposed to cost $14 billion and be complete by 2017.2009: The Georgia Public Service Commission approves Georgia Power’s request to begin construction. Weeks later, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue signs a law allowing Georgia Power to make customers pay financing costs during construction. Contractors begin moving dirt at Vogtle.2010: President Barack Obama's administration announces $8.33 billion in loan guarantees for Vogtle, lowering borrowing costs for the owners.2012: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves licenses for Vogtle and Summer. By then, with construction underway, the projects were already running behind.2014: Problems with modular construction slow the Vogtle and Summer projects, disproving promises that giant Lego-like modules would make building faster, cheaper and produce a higher-quality result.2015: Georgia Power and plant construction contractors sue each other over delays that add more than $3 billion to the project and three years to the completion date.2017: Mounting delays and losses lead Westinghouse, then a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp., to file for bankruptcy. To walk away, Toshiba pays $3.7 billion to the Georgia owners and $2.2 billion to the South Carolina owners. The South Carolina owners abandon construction at Summer after state-owned utility Santee Cooper votes to stop. The Georgia Public Service Commission votes to let work continue at Vogtle as the price tag crosses $25 billion.2018: The city-owned utility in Jacksonville, Florida, unsuccessfully tries to void its contract to buy Vogtle's power from the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. Oglethorpe Power, owned by Georgia electric cooperatives, threatens to pull out and torpedo Vogtle. Oglethorpe relents after Gov. Nathan Deal intervenes and Georgia Power agrees to pay some potential overruns.2019: The Trump administration finalizes another $3.7 billion in loan guarantees for Vogtle, bringing the total to $12 billion.2020: The COVID-19 pandemic slows work at Vogtle. Former SCANA Corp. executives begin pleading guilty to federal criminal charges over concealing delays at Summer.2021: Georgia Power announces a cascading series of four delays, with monitors saying contractors and Southern Co. did sloppy work while rushing to meet an unachievable schedule. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission steps up oversight. Costs to owners exceed $28 billion, double the original estimate.2022: Georgia Power's co-owners sue, saying the utility is reneging on its contract to shoulder overruns, as costs to owners surpass $30 billion. Georgia Power settles with Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. Unit 3 begins loading radioactive fuel.2023: Vogtle's Unit 3 begins generating electricity, with officials saying it may reach full power output by May 27. Unit 4 reaches a key testing phase. Costs to owners reach $31 billion.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Cigna Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 6th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.23 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$4.92 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cigna Group stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $247.41. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cigna Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Cigna Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Cigna Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Cigna Group paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Cigna Group generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 14% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that Cigna Group's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Cigna Group's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 21% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Cigna Group looks like a promising growth company.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Cigna Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 62% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Cigna Group for the upcoming dividend? Cigna Group has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Cigna Group looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Cigna Group that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Even some of Wall Street’s most lauded stock pickers are worried about the implications.Citing an unnerving disconnect between the current positioning of stocks and bonds – essentially, the bond market pricing in a recession while stocks appear to factor in a more optimistic outlook – billionaire Cliff Asness thinks things could get hairy if a recession comes into play.“If inflation stays sticky or it comes down because we enter a nontrivial recession – it’s equities that I think are in a scary place,” Asness recently opined. “They’re not priced very consistently with bonds.”That’s not to say the co-founder and CIO of AQR Capital Management – a firm with $100 billion in assets under management – is turning away from stocks. In fact, the quant investing sage has been loading up on the equities he must believe are able to fend off any unwanted economic developments.We ran a pair of his choices through the TipRanks database to see what the rest of the Street has to say about them. Here are the results.The Cigna Group (CI)If a recession is about to mess things up, a safe harbor is often provided by healthcare stocks, a segment seen as one able to withstand an economic downturn. Cigna might be a good example of their value. The global health services organization is a huge industry player, boasting a market cap over $72 billion, and specializing in providing a wide range of healthcare solutions to individuals, employers, and government entities.The company operates via two primary divisions – Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth offers a comprehensive set of services and capabilities that include benefits management, care management, intelligence, and pharmacy solutions. Cigna Healthcare division brings together the former U.S. Medical segment (U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government) and the remaining International Health business. This division offers medical solutions across various markets with a focus on local needs.Story continuesThe size and span of the business is easy to gauge from the company’s revenue haul. In the most recently reported quarter – for 1Q23 – the top-line reached $46.5 billion, amounting to a 5.7% year-over-year increase and beating the forecast by $1.07 billion. There was a beat on the bottom-line too, as adj. EPS of $5.41 came in above the $5.24 consensus estimate. For the outlook, the company raised expectations for both the sales and the profit profile.Nevertheless, despite the market’s positive reaction to the print, with the shift in 2023 from value names to tech – and after outperforming last year – CI shares have taken a beating in 2023.Evidently, Asness felt the time was right to increase his CI stake. During Q1, he loaded up on 560,014 shares, increasing his holdings by 95% to a total of 1,152,991 shares. These currently command a market value of over $316 million.Mirroring that confident stance, Truist analyst David S. MacDonald saw plenty to like in the Q1 report. The 5-star analyst wrote, “We remain bullish on CI following a solid start to ’23 marked by balanced growth across segments, top and bottom-line beats, better MCR and raised guidance. Importantly, the call and enhanced 10-Q disclosures provided additional detail/comfort around rebate retention exposure/retail spread, PBM affordability and transparency and we think should help allay concerns about potential regulatory risk. Finally, the capital light business model continues to churn out attractive FCF, providing ample flexibility for ongoing investment/expansion.”These comments underpin MacDonald’s Buy rating while his $375 price target makes room for 12-month returns of ~52%. (To watch MacDonald’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 4 Buys and 8 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $317.69, suggesting ~28% from current levels. As an added bonus, CI also pays a dividend. The current quarterly payout stands at $1.23, yielding 1.88%. (See Cigna stock forecast)American International Group (AIG)For our next Asness-endorsed name will turn to insurance giant AIG. The company is one of the world’s largest insurance and financial services organizations. Operating through various subsidiaries, AIG provides a wide range of insurance products and services to customers in over 80 countries. AIG’s offerings include property and casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement products, and mortgage insurance, among others.Driven by robust underwriting gains, the global insurance powerhouse beat the profit estimates in its latest quarterly report – for 1Q23. Representing its strongest first quarter underwriting results, general insurance underwriting income climbed by 13% year-over-year to $502 million. That helped adj. EPS rise from $1.49 in the year-ago quarter to $1.63, while outpacing the $1.42 the analysts were looking for. And while partially negated by lower alternative investment income, total consolidated net investment income still climbed 9% to $3.5 billion.Furthermore, the company gave a boost to its quarterly dividend, raising it from $0.32 to $0.36 per share, the first increase since 2016. The dividend currently yields 2.37%.It’s safe to say Asness has confidence in AIG’s ongoing success. He increased his holdings by 79% in Q1 with the purchase of 2,557,149 shares. He now holds a total of 5,794,696 shares, worth ~$306 million.AIG also gets the support of Goldman Sachs analyst Alex Scott. Scanning the latest financial statement, Scott explains why was impressed with the results. “We were very encouraged by the AIG earnings report this quarter as it showed favorable growth, further loss ratio improvement, favorable reserve development despite inflationary pressures, contained catastrophes despite elevated industry experience, net investment income benefiting to a greater degree than we expected from higher interest rates, and corporate expense discipline,” Scott said. “Further, we felt that the discussion around 1) the ultimate level of corporate expenses and 2) margin improvement in US personal lines was also a positive for the earnings power of the company.”Accordingly, Scott rates AIG shares a Buy, backed by a $79 price target. The implication for investors? Potential upside of ~50% from current levels. (To watch Scott’s track record, click here)Overall, 13 analysts have chimed in with AIG reviews over the past 3 months, and these break down into 8 Buys and 5 Holds, adding up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $67.69 average target, a year from now, investors will be sitting on returns of 28%.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this health insurer have returned -3.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has lost 3.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $6.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.79 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.27 indicates a change of +14% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cigna.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $47.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $188.73 billion and $225.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +19.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $46.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.4%. EPS of $5.41 for the same period compares with $6.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.11%. The EPS surprise was +3.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:SWKS) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.92bUS$1.82bUS$2.02bUS$1.87bUS$1.97bUS$2.00bUS$2.04bUS$2.08bUS$2.12bUS$2.16bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 1.66%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.96%Est @ 2.00% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$945US$873US$807(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$27bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$27b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$10bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$22b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$105, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Skyworks Solutions as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.385. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Skyworks SolutionsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

To skip our detailed analysis and head directly to the world’s best militaries, go to the 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023.A lot has happened over the last couple of years. Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban. Azerbaijan has seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control. Regular military skirmishes between China and India are reported in the bordering regions of Ladakh and Aksai Chin. Worst of all, Russia’s war on Ukraine has now gone past 450 days with no end in sight. These events have forced defense experts to dive deeper into the changing dynamics of modern warfare.Determinants of Military StrengthResults in recent conflicts have shown that having a big military is not alone the most significant criteria to gauge a military’s strength. Manpower, logistics, fleet size and sophistication of tanks, aircrafts, fighter jets, and naval warships are just as important determinants. Other key factors include the professionalism of soldiers, training level of pilots, battle hardness of the armed forces, and arms manufacturing capabilities of the nation. Nuclear deterrence is another key competitive edge that some countries hold over others. This deterrence is based on the assumption that another country will avoid escalating a war to protect its own security. There are geographic advantages as well in the war theater. The United States has over 750 overseas military bases across more than 80 countries, which gives them the capability to conduct raids against enemy targets anywhere in the world.Defense IndustryCurrently, the U.S. alone accounts for nearly 40% of the defense spending worldwide. China, Russia, and countries in the Middle East are also heavily spending billions of dollars on military expenditure per annum. Global military spending increased from $1,139 billion in 2001 to $2,113 billion in 2021 – a rise of nearly 50% in two decades. A report released by the Statista Research Department declared Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as the largest armament manufacturer in the world in 2021. The American company recorded revenue worth $65 billion from defense related sales that year. The top five leading armament manufacturers in the list were all American companies. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) was followed by Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) at second, with defense sales revenue of over $41 billion. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) took third spot with $35 billion in revenue. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) were listed fourth and fifth, with defense revenues of $31.5 billion and $30.8 billion respectively. Aviation Industry Corporation of China was the largest armament manufacturer outside of the U.S., recording $42 billion in revenue.Story continuesMilitary Technology FrontiersThe U.S. continues to maintain air superiority over Russia and China due its fifth-generation fighter jets. These jets include major technologies developed during the 21st century, such as “stealth” which differentiates them from previous generations of jets. These new and advanced fighter jets come with special paint and other features which make it hard for the enemy radars to detect them. In 2005, the U.S. became the first country to launch a fifth-generation fighter jet, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. The F-35B Lightening II was introduced in 2015 by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to give the U.S. further edge in aerial battles. Russia, with Su-57, and China with its J-20 are other countries that have their own fifth-generation fighter jets. Japan, India, Turkey, and Sweden are currently undergoing initiatives to develop their own fifth-generation fighter jets.Another key military frontier in recent times has been hypersonic weapons which evade advanced radar systems and travel in the upper atmosphere at about 6,200 km per hour - more than five times the speed of sound. There are two types of hypersonic missiles - the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) and hypersonic cruise missile (HCM).The former has the ability to leave Earth's atmosphere and then plunge back into it. On the other hand, the HCM travels at lightening speed at low levels and can also carry a nuclear warhead. Russia is leading the arms race in hypersonic military technology, and is believed to have at least 42 hypersonic missiles known as Kinzhal, as per the Ukrainian military. The U.S. is also pursuing development of hypersonic weapons. According to a report, the U.S. Department of Defense set aside $3.2 billion in 2021 in R&amp;D financing for hypersonic weapons. China, the UK, and Israel have also conducted basic research on hypersonic military technology alongside other countries.MethodologyWe have considered a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics to rank the best militaries in the world. The quantitative metrics include gross domestic product (GDP) and defense spending of countries in the year 2022, number of active military personnel in service, fleet size of combat tanks, nuclear warheads, number of fighter jets and naval vessels, active airfields, military satellites, overseas military bases, and cyber capability. Weights have been assigned to each metric and aggregated to determine the rank of strength for each military. Qualitatively, factors such as combat experience, and recognized professionalism and training of active military personnel have been considered. These are important factors because in the last decade or so, new players have emerged as top spenders on military expenditure, but their manpower lacks the required level of experience and expertise to handle sophisticated equipment. Some of the prominent metrics in our weightings have also been highlighted in the list.Statistics and analysis from a wide range of sources have been carefully studied for preparing this list. These include Janes, Global Firepower Index of 2023, Flight International, Belfar Center's National Cyber Security Index of 2022 (which measures countries' cyber capability on a scale of 1-100), The Power Atlas, and various media publications.25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023NEstudio/Shutterstock.comHere are the 25 most powerful militaries in the world in 2023.25. ThailandGDP: $524 billionDefense spending: $6.3 billionManpower: 350,000Tanks: 587Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 469Naval vessels: 292Thailand’s defense expenditure has grown over the years, and has been driven by factors such as external security threats, modernization program, and arms race in the neighborhood. Since 2006, ASEAN member countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia have more than doubled their military spending due to regional disputes, such as in the South China Sea.24. CanadaGDP: $2,140 billionDefense spending: $36.3 billionManpower: 70,000Tanks: 82Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 380Naval vessels: 61With over $36 billion in defense spending in 2022, Canada is emerging as a major military strength. In January, 2023, the government announced it was buying 88 F-35 stealth fifth-generation fighter jets, developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), in a bid to enhance Arctic security and meet NATO spending obligations. Canada has an active military manpower of 70,000 with 82 tanks and 61 naval vessels. It also has 1,467 airfields which are testament of Canada’s logistical capabilities.23. NetherlandsGDP: $1,020 billionDefense spending: $13.7 billionManpower: 35,000Tanks: 18Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 156Naval vessels: 61Netherlands finds its place among the top militaries in the world in 2023 primarily due to investments in air power. It currently has a fleet of 156 military aircraft, including 40 F-16 and 13 F-35 fighter jets. Its combat tanks are only 18, and that is because in 2011, the Dutch government, as a cost-cutting measure, eliminated its entire force of 60 tanks. However, a GDP now of over $1 trillion allows the Dutch government to spend and raise its tanks fleet again.22. AustraliaGDP: $1,700 billionDefense spending: $30 billionManpower: 60,500Tanks: 59Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 430Naval vessels: 43In May 2023, Australia proposed a defense budget of $30 billion, and announced to purchase nuclear submarines, the SSN-AUKUS, as part of a three-way agreement involving Australia, the UK, and the U.S. The fleet size of Australia’s military purpose aircrafts stands at 430, which also includes 37 F-35A fighter jets. An order for 72 more of these fifth-generation fighter jets has been placed with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). With a tank fleet of 59 and active military personnel of over 60,000, Australia finds its place among the 25 most powerful militaries in 2023.21. EgyptGDP: $475 billionDefense spending: $4.35 billionManpower: 440,000Tanks: 4,664Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 1,062Naval vessels: 245Egypt is another powerful country on the list from the MENA region. It has an active military manpower of 440,000, with over 4,000 tanks, more than 1,000 aircrafts and fighter jets, and 245 naval assets. The country receives military assistance worth $1.3 billion per year from the United States to facilitate the transition from outdated Soviet era equipment. Egypt has a fleet of 168 F-16 fourth-generation fighter jets, and is purchasing 30 units of Rafale jets and 12 CH-47F Chinooks to further boost its air force capabilities. Sisi’s government has increased defense expenditure amid ongoing terrorism in the Sinai peninsula and instability in Libya. Under a contract between the United States and Egypt, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) will provide sustainment and technical support to Egypt’s E-2 aircrafts.20. IranGDP: $368 billionDefense spending: $5.5 billionManpower: 575,000Tanks: 4,071Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 543Naval vessels: 101Much of Iran’s military strength is owed to its manpower and combat tanks fleet. Global sanctions have impeded the country’s economic growth and subsequently its ability to upgrade its air and naval power. The country ranks amongst the lowest in both cyber security and space presence. However, despite these challenges, Iran makes the list due to the battle-hardness and strength of its ground forces as well as its ICBM arsenal.19. IndonesiaGDP: $1,200 billionDefense spending: $8.8 billionManpower: 400,000Tanks: 314Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 461Naval vessels: 324Indonesia is next on the list. In 2023, the country allocated $8.8 billion on developing the country’s primary defense system. This includes an order of shipment of 42 Rafale fighter jets and two Scorpene submarines. With a GDP of around $1.2 trillion, Indonesia has the potential to further develop itself as a key security player in the southeast Asia region.18. BrazilGDP: $1,920 billionDefense spending: $21.8 billionManpower: 360,000Tanks: 466Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 679Naval vessels: 112Brazil’s GDP is nearing $2 trillion. It has an active manpower in military of 360,000, and up to 87 million people – 40% of the population – who are fit for military service if required to join. The South American country boasts 4,093 active airfields, which is the second most in the world, after the United States. Advantages over manpower and logistics make Brazil one of the most powerful militaries in the world in 2023. The government is spending heavily on modernizing its defense, and has procured 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden to strengthen its air force. It is also upgrading its surveillance radars under a contract with Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX).17. SpainGDP: $1,450 billionDefense spending: $14.88 billionManpower: 120,000Tanks: 327Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 503Naval vessels: 166Spain spends only about 1% of its GDP on defense. Despite that, it has one of Europe’s most powerful militaries. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the government in Madrid declared to boost military expenditure to meet NATO’s defense spending targets. It plans to double military spending by 2029 and is currently increasing the number of troops deployed in eastern Europe.16. ItalyGDP: $2,107 billionDefense spending: $32 billionManpower: 170,000Tanks: 197Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 862Naval vessels: 313Italy ranks eleventh in the world on defense spending. Its armed forces are highly regarded for their capabilities, as well as contributions in international peacekeeping efforts. Defense experts have put key focus on the strength Italy possesses in combat helicopters and aircraft carrier warships. Currently, it has over 862 military aircraft, of which more than 400 are helicopters. Italy also has a fleet of 14 F-35 fifth-generation fighter jets. On the naval side, it has 2 aircraft carrier warships – the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour.15. UkraineGDP: $200 billionDefense spending: $44 billionManpower: 200,000Tanks: 1,890Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 318Naval vessels: 38Ukraine’s response to Russian invasion has received acclaim from security experts across the world. The country has channeled billions of dollars into defense to support its war efforts. Kyiv has also received heavy military equipment as aid from allied countries, which has helped boost its military strength. It requires mention that Ukraine has a huge defense industry at home, with manufacturing focused on ballistic missiles and engines for tanks and helicopters. Until 2012, it was the third largest arms exporter in the world. Its tanks fleet currently stands at 1,890 and has over 300 aircraft and fighter jets which have proven instrumental in resisting Russian advances.The United States in December 2022 awarded Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) a $1.2 billion contract to provide Ukraine six advanced surface-to-air missile system batteries. Moreover, Ukraine boasts of high capabilities in cyber security, having a rating score of 75.32 out of 100 in the 2022 Cyber Security Index rankings. A leading software engineering and technology company, Ciklum, that specializes in cyber security has its board chair in Kyiv. Ukraine has developed capabilities in cyber defense as a reaction to multiple cyber attacks from Russia, making Ukraine one of the most powerful militaries on the globe in 2023.14. PolandGDP: $686 billionDefense spending: $45 billionManpower: 120,000Tanks: 569Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 436Naval vessels: 86Poland is one of the highest spenders on defense among NATO members. Earlier this year, prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced plans to spend around $100 billion between 2023 and 2035 on procurement of sophisticated weapons and making the Polish army the largest in Europe in terms of manpower – with the goal of touching 250,000 active military personnel. $10 billion have already been spent on acquiring advanced rocket systems. In July 2022, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) delivered the first of six IBSC Engagement Operations Centers for Poland’s medium-range air and missile defenses.13. PakistanGDP: $377 billionDefense spending: $7.5 billionManpower: 654,000Tanks: 3,742Nuclear warheads: 165Aircrafts including fighter jets: 1,387Naval vessels: 114Despite economic challenges, Pakistan spends heavily on defense expenditure due to the perceived threat from archrival India. Turmoil in Afghanistan since the 1980s has also kept Pakistan’s western front prone to violence in the form of tribal militancy in the northwest and cross-border terrorist attacks. The country boasts a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, leapfrogging India in the nuclear arms race. Its battle-hardened military is considered amongst the strongest in the region and also lends security assistance to allies in the GCC. Pakistan’s air fleet comprises 1,387 aircrafts. The air forces’ combat fighter jets include 135 F-7s, 109 JF-17s, and 44 F-16s, among others.12. Saudi ArabiaGDP: $950 billionDefense spending: $75 billionManpower: 225,000Tanks: 1,273Nuclear warheads: 0Aircrafts including fighter jets: 897Naval vessels: 57Saudi Arabia in 2022 returned in the list of the top five spenders on military expenditure, according to a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The kingdom spent an estimated $75 billion on its military, which represents over 7% of its GDP, and more than 40% of all military spending in the Middle East in 2022. Saudi Arabia, which relies on oil as its major source of revenue, has spent heavily on defense in the wake of the Arab Spring in the early 2010s. Since 2015, it has been involved in a military intervention in neighboring Yemen. The Saudi Royal Air Force’s active combat jets include 211 F-15s, 81 Tornado IDS, and 72 Eurofighter Typhoons.11. IsraelGDP: $502 billionDefense spending: $22.6 billionManpower: 173,000Tanks: 2,200Nuclear warheads: 90Aircrafts including fighter jets: 597Naval vessels: 67Israel’s major military strength is derived from its air capabilities. It boasts a fleet of over 600 military aircrafts, of which nearly 40% are fighter jets including 27 F-35 fifth-generation fighters and 175 active F-16s. The country is emerging as a major exporter of air defense systems. Haaretz reports that in two years since the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020, Israel signed $3 billion worth of defense export agreements with regional countries.Click to continue reading and see the 10 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023.Suggested Articles:20 Strongest Militaries in Europe12 Biggest Militaries in the World: Does Size Matter?15 Most Powerful Navies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Product offerings of the companies mostly include athletic and casual footwear, fashion apparel and activewear, sports equipment, bags, balls, and other sports and fashion accessories. The companies showcase their products through their branded outlets and websites. Some companies distribute products via other retail stores, such as national chains, online retailers, sporting goods stores, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.A Look at What's Shaping Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry's FutureConsumer Demand Trends: Players in the industry have been benefiting from strong consumer demand for activewear/athleisure products and footwear, and the trend is expected to continue in 2023. Athletic goods and apparel companies offer products from footwear, sweatshirts, leggings, pants, jackets and tops to yoga wear and running clothes for men and women. The increasing fashion sense is boosting the demand for innovative clothes and footwear in the United States. Industry participants have been focused on product innovations, active promotions, store expansion and enhancing e-commerce capabilities to gain market share. Favorable health and wellness trends have been the key to inspiring footwear manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The companies continue to innovate styles, materials and colors, and incorporate functional designs to grab a large share of the fast-growing market. Moreover, multi-functional shoes, which cater to casual and formal looks, have been gaining popularity. Increased participation of women in sports and outdoor activities in recent years has been a boon for industry players.E-Commerce Investments: E-commerce has been playing a crucial role in the athleisure market’s growth. The companies in the segment are looking to build a customer base through websites, social media and other digital channels. As consumers continue to shop from home, growth of athletic-inspired apparel and digital sales are likely to continue. Companies focused on expanding their athletic-based apparel lines and building on e-commerce capabilities are expected to witness growth in the long run. Efforts to accelerate deliveries through investments in supply chains and order fulfillment avenues are likely to provide an edge to industry players. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovations and improved checkouts, as well as mobile point-of-sale capabilities, to make stores attractive. Efforts to enhance experiences through multiple channels are likely to contribute significantly to improving traffic and transactions in stores and online.Cost Headwinds: Companies in the industry are witnessing elevated costs due to factors like commodity cost inflation, increased freight costs, reinvestments and other impacts. Supply-chain constraints, and elevated ocean freight and logistic costs have been acting as deterrents. Many companies expect increased freight and logistic costs to hurt margins in the near term. Elevated marketing expenses, higher operating overhead and demand-creating expenses, and increased investments to enhance store and digital operations have been raising SG&amp;A costs. Also, industry participants are witnessing rising costs to support brand campaigns and digital investments. The exit from the Russia business due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to be the key concern for some players. A tough and competitive labor market is another concern. These factors pose a threat to industry players’ margins.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is an 11-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

The regulator tracks performance for 4,672 commercial banks and savings institutions.The drop in deposits, which amounted to 2.5%, was largely due to movement by uninsured depositors who were above the $250,000-per-account level backstopped by the FDIC. They pulled $663 billion, while insured deposits actually increased by $255 billion.The FDIC report covers a tumultuous period marked by an aggressive rise in interest rates and the failures of three banks in a matter of days, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank on March 10 and March 12.First Republic later went down in the second quarter, on May 1, in what was the second-largest bank failure in US history.""The more lasting effects of the industry's response to that stress may not become fully apparent until we've received the second-quarter results,"" FDIC chair Martin Gruenberg said in a press briefing with reporters.Stocks of several regional banks that came under scrutiny during the turmoil of the first quarter were down again Wednesday, including PacWest (PACW), Western Alliance (WAL), Zions (ZION), and Comerica (CMA).The problem listThe new report shows that other lenders beyond Silicon Valley Bank experienced extreme stress during the first quarter. The number of banks on the FDIC's ""problem list"" increased by four to 43, and assets held by banks on that list rose to $58 billion.Banks on the FDIC's problem list typically have multiple weaknesses identified by regulators in confidential supervisory ratings and can be seized and shut down unless the issues are resolved quickly. That list swelled into the hundreds during the industry's last big crisis which began in 2008.Story continuesSilicon Valley Bank was one of three banks that failed during the first quarter. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)What was also clear from the FDIC's new report is that a core measure of profitability declined during the first quarter as interest rates rose and depositors began moving their money elsewhere.The outflows forced many banks to start paying more to keep depositors and those higher costs cut into the industry's net interest margins, which measure the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for their deposits.The FDIC said those margins declined by 7 basis points from the previous quarter to 3.31%, as the cost of deposits for banks rose faster than the yield earned on their loans.Loan yields increased 32 basis points during the quarter to 6.08% while deposits increased 43 basis points to 1.42%.'Downside risks'Overall profits were up 17% for all FDIC-insured institutions during the first quarter but that net income would have been flat after excluding accounting gains recorded by institutions that acquired two failed banks.The industry also ended the quarter with a sizable amount of unrealized losses on securities held by banks. But that amount, $515 billion, was down 16.5% from the prior quarter. These paper losses don't count against earnings for most banks unless the assets are sold.Gruenberg said the industry remains under pressure on a number of fronts. ""The banking industry continues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, slower economic growth, and geopolitical uncertainty,"" he said.""Credit quality and profitability may weaken due to these risks and may result in a further tightening of loan underwriting, slower loan growth, higher provision expenses and liquidity constraints,"" he added, citing specific challenges from commercial real estate loans backed by office properties.""These will be matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

However, declining revenues and lower loan balances make us apprehensive.Looking at its fundamentals, the company's expenses witnessed a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.5% for the three years ended 2022. The declining trend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Expense reduction efforts such as streamlining organizational structure, closing branches and reducing headcount undertaken from third-quarter 2020 aided the decline in costs. WFC expects these initiatives to continue this year, which will likely keep supporting bottom-line growth.The deposits witnessed a rise in CAGR of 1.5% for the three years ended 2022. The metric declined in the first quarter of 2023. The considerable strength in the consumer business and commercial banking segments will likely support the deposit balance in the upcoming period. Further, this will likely strengthen the bank’s liquidity position.Wells Fargo is expected to continue to enhance shareholder value through meaningful capital deployments. It pays out regular dividends on a quarterly basis with the last hike of 20% made in July 2022.The company also has a share buyback program in place. In first-quarter 2023, it repurchased 86.4 million shares and had 164 million shares remaining under the repurchase authorization. We believe that given its robust capital position and ample liquidity, its capital-deployment activities will boost investor confidence in the stock.Analysts seem optimistic regarding WFC’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised 1.3% upward in the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past year, shares of WFC have declined 9.3% compared with the industry's fall of 15.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the company's revenue growth has become challenging. The metric witnessed a negative CAGR of 3.9% over the last five years (2018-2022). Though revenues increased in first-quarter 2023, the same may not be replicable in the upcoming quarters. Higher funding costs are expected to impede net interest income (NII) and revenue growth in the upcoming quarters. Management expects a sequential decline in second-quarter 2023 NII.WFC has continued to register a decline in loans over the past several years on planned run-off from non-strategic/liquidating portfolios. The company’s loans witnessed a negative three-year CAGR (ended 2022) of 0.7%, with the decline continuing in the first quarter of 2023. We expect Wells Fargo’s loan balance to remain disappointing with the asset cap remaining in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding compliance and operational risk management.As mortgage rates are expected to remain high in the near future, origination volumes are less likely to witness growth. This is expected to reduce Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking income, which consists of activities such as residential and commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing. The metric saw a three-year (ended 2022) negative CAGR of 20.1%, with the year-over-year decline continuing in the first quarter of 2023.Bank Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc. CASH and First Citizens BancShares FCNCA.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pathward Financial’s current-year earnings has been revised 1.8% upward over the past 60 days. Its shares have gained 6% in the past six months. Currently, CASH carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).First Citizens BancShares currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Pfizer's vaccine was approved for people aged 60 and older, the company said, the same age group as GSK's shot.In a late-stage study, Pfizer's vaccine, to be sold under the brand name Abrysvo, was 67% effective among those aged 60 and older with two or more symptoms of RSV, and 85.7% against severe illness defined by three or more symptoms.Pfizer and GSK have said they expect a multibillion-dollar market for RSV vaccines.The company expects to make the vaccine available during the third quarter, ahead of the next RSV season, once the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) signs off on its use.The CDC's advisory committee is expected to meet in June to discuss the vaccines, including who should receive them and how often.Pfizer did not disclose a price for the vaccine. It said the price would be value-based to support routine vaccination for the recommended age group for the shots.If the vaccine is recommended by the CDC for routine use, it will be widely available at no out-of-pocket cost for most older Americans covered by the government Medicare health plan, the company said.RSV usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can also lead to serious illness and hospitalization. It is estimated to be responsible for 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the United States annually, according to government data.Pfizer is also seeking FDA approval for its RSV vaccine to prevent the disease in infants by inoculating pregnant women. It could become the first RSV vaccine available to protect babies, who are among those at greatest risk for severe illness.Story continuesThe shot received backing by the agency's panel of outside experts earlier this month for use in pregnant women.The company has said it is ready to launch its RSV vaccine for both older adults and pregnant women in the United States and Europe this year.Moderna Inc has said it expects to file seeking approval for its RSV vaccine this quarter for those aged 60 and older.Sanofi and partner AstraZeneca Plc in November gained European marketing authorization for their antibody treatment nirsevimab for preventing RSV in newborns and infants.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ABRYSVO™ (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine), the company’s bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine, for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years and older. ABRYSVO is unadjuvanted and composed of two preF proteins selected to optimize protection against RSV A and B strains and was observed to be safe and effective.""A vaccine to help prevent RSV had been an elusive public health goal for more than half a century. Today’s approval is a monumental step forward in delivering on Pfizer’s commitment to help alleviate the significant burden of RSV in higher-risk populations, which includes older adults,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""ABRYSVO will address a need to help protect older adults against the potentially serious consequences of RSV disease. We are extremely grateful to the clinical trial participants, study investigator teams and our dedicated Pfizer colleagues for their roles in making this vaccine available.""The FDA’s decision is based on the data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05035212) RENOIR (RSV vaccine Efficacy study iN Older adults Immunized against RSV disease). RENOIR is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a single dose of the vaccine in adults 60 years of age and older. RENOIR has enrolled approximately 37,000 participants, randomized to receive RSVpreF 120 μg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The results were recently published in The New England Journal of Medicine. RENOIR is ongoing, with efficacy data being collected in the second RSV season in the study.Story continues""This past RSV season demonstrated the serious consequences and potential health risks this virus poses for older adults,"" said Edward E. Walsh, MD, Professor of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, and principal RENOIR investigator. ""Today’s FDA approval of ABRYSVO recognizes significant scientific progress, and importantly helps provide older adults potential protection against RSV and an opportunity to improve community health by helping prevent the disease.""RSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness worldwide.2 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual, potentially causing severe illness or death.3,4,5 In the U.S., the burden RSV causes in older adults is considerable. The severity of RSV disease can increase with age and comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and congestive heart failure.6The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet on June 21, 2023, to discuss recommendations for the appropriate use of RSV vaccines in older adults. Pending the outcome of this meeting, Pfizer anticipates supply availability in Q3 2023 ahead of the anticipated RSV season this fall.Earlier this month, Pfizer reported positive top-line results from the Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of ABRYSVO coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) in adults 65 years and older.7 Pfizer intends to publish these results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Earlier this month, Pfizer also announced it would be initiating multiple clinical trials evaluating RSVpreF in healthy children ages 2-5; children ages 5-18 with underlying medical conditions; adults ages 18-60 at high-risk due to underlying medical conditions; and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high-risk for RSV.8About ABRYSVO Regulatory ReviewOn March 24, 2022, Pfizer announced the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ABRYSVO for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age and older. This decision was followed by the FDA’s acceptance of ABRYSVO’s Biologics License Application (BLA) under priority review for older adults in November 2022.Pfizer is currently the only company pursuing regulatory applications for an RSV investigational vaccine candidate for both an indication to help protect older adults, as well as an indication to help protect infants through maternal immunization. Previously, Pfizer announced that the FDA had granted priority review for a BLA for RSVpreF for the prevention of lower respiratory tract and severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. Earlier this month, Pfizer announced that the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted that available data support the efficacy and safety of RSVpreF for the maternal indication. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date in August 2023.In February 2023, it was announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review Pfizer’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) under accelerated assessment for RSVpreF, as submitted for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. The formal review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) currently is ongoing. Also in February 2023, Pfizer Japan announced an application was filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for RSVpreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, Pfizer Canada announced Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for both individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV.INDICATION FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO is a vaccine indicated for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in people 60 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of its componentsFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO.

Data from the study showed that participants treated with marstacimab achieved statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rate (“ABR”) compared with the current standard-of-care treatment for hemophilia patients, during a 12-month period.Study participants, who received factor replacement therapy in the six-month lead-in period, achieved a 92% reduction in bleeds upon switching to marstacimab. Data from the BASIS study also showed superiority of marstacimab over prophylaxis regimen, achieving a 35% reduction in ABR.Based on the above results, management believes that marstacimab can potentially become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for hemophilia B patients and a treatment option that addresses the diverse needs of patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors.Shares of Pfizer have lost 30.2% in the year so far against the industry’s 5.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe BASIS study is evaluating marstacimab in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years to less than 75 years) with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B, with or without inhibitors. Data from the inhibitor cohort is expected in the next year.Pfizer plans to complete the ongoing analyses of full data from the BASIS study. Based on this data, management will start discussions with regulatory authorities with a goal to initiate filing for marstacimab in the near future.A rare genetic blood disorder, hemophilia is caused by a missing clotting protein (FVIII in case of hemophilia A and FIX in case of hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting. If the blood is not clot properly, it can lead to painful bleeding inside the joints that can cause scarring and damage.Story continuesPer Pfizer, marstacimab targets TFPI, which is a natural anticoagulation protein that functions to prevent the formation of blood clots.Like marstacimab, Novo Nordisk NVO also developed its own anti-TFPI inhibitor, concizumab, for treating hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. Last month, Novo Nordisk received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA on the regulatory filing for concizumab in hemophilia A or B patients. Per the CRL, the agency requested additional data from Novo Nordisk on the drug’s administration and manufacturing process. Novo Nordisk intends to work closely with the FDA to provide the data requested by the latter.Other than marstacimab, Pfizer is developing two other investigational gene therapies for hemophilia patients — fidanacogene elaparvovec (for hemophilia B) and giroctocogene fitelparvovec (for hemophilia A) — in separate phase III studies.Last December, Pfizer reported positive top-line data from a phase III study (BENEGENE-2) which evaluated fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of male adult patients with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B. The study achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority and superiority in the ABR post-infusion with the gene therapy.Several companies have developed their own gene therapies in hemophilia indication.Last November, the FDA approved Hemgenix, a gene therapy for treating hemophilia B in adults aged 18 years and older. This gene therapy has been developed by uniQure QURE in partnership with CSL Behring, the latter being a subsidiary of CSL Limited. Following approval, uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix became the first FDA-approved gene therapy for treating hemophilia B. The FDA’s approval of uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix was based on results from the pivotal HOPE-B study, which demonstrated that following infusion with the gene-therapy, patients produced mean FIX activity of 39% at six months and 36.7% at 24 months. The clinical development program for Hemgenix was initially led by uniQure, which was subsequently transferred to CSL after it acquired global rights to commercialize the treatment.The newest drug in BioMarin Pharmaceuticals’ BMRN portfolio is Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or valrox), a gene therapy for severe hemophilia A, which received conditional marketing authorization in the European Union in August 2022. In the United States, BioMarin had previously submitted a biologics license application (BLA) in 2019 for valrox to address hemophilia A. However, the FDA issued a CRL to the BLA. BioMarin refiled the BLA in September 2022 and a decision is expected by the end of next month.Pfizer Inc. Price Pfizer Inc. PricePfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc.

The company plans to slash 30% of non-customer facing roles gradually in the next five years with finance, accounting and HR being the domains most likely to be affected by it. This is the second such announcement from IBM as it announced the 3,900-job cutting earlier this year.The adoption of advanced AI capabilities comes with certain advantages, which are the main driving force toward automation. AI automates several high-volume repetitive tasks in the enterprise’s everyday operations. These free up human resources that can then be utilized in other creative areas. In a relatively short time, AI can process large amounts of data and generate actionable insights faster and accelerate the decision-making process. Workflow automation can significantly minimize the probability of errors and reduce operational expenses.Owing to these advantages, several tech giants and big corporate houses are opting to include AI technology into their business operations. Industry trends indicate growing adoption of AI is likely to gain further momentum in the near future. Even though the rapid integration of AI is estimated to add $16 million to the global economy by 2030, about 18% of the global workforce (mostly in developed countries) is likely to be affected by it.Nevertheless, IBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. The company’s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will drive profitability. In addition, lower operating expenses due to a truncated global workforce are likely to improve its liquidity. .The stock has lost 7.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.InterDigital, Inc.

235,60bc49b7-def3-31d5-8adf-2d5176a100a6,MPC,2023-06-01,3 Dividend Stocks to Gain Despite Energy Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-gain-despite-124900857.html,1685537340,STORY,"['MPC', 'PSX', 'EOG']","[Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the market has witnessed wild swings in oil prices. This reflects that notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby poising Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC,EOG Resources, Inc. EOG and Phillips 66 PSX for growth.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should never forget how oil prices behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines by scientists, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil is currently trading at close to $70 per barrel.Dividend Stocks to Keep an Eye OnOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks to GainMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation.

This led to the impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.The company’s adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share surged 86.2% year over year. Net sales grew 5.9% to $2,346.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 8.2%, driven by favorable price and sales mix, offset by a slight decline in financial volume. Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from premiumization.Molson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer without hampering the support for its existing large brands; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, Molson Coors plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying the structure. The company is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Its cost-saving program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Molson Coors is committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Driven by these factors, management projects sales year-over-year growth in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis, in line with our estimate of 1.5% growth. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $690 million, plus or minus 5%. The company expects an underlying effective tax rate of 21-23%. Consolidated net interest expenses are anticipated to be $240 million, plus or minus 5%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 13.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5%.However, the company continues to witness lower brand and financial volume. In first-quarter 2023, Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 2.1% to 16.2 million due to sluggishness in America, as well as EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 17 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Also, inflationary pressure related to materials, conversion and energy costs, and mixed impacts of portfolio premiumization act as deterrents. TAP has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry mainly due to pricing actions.ConclusionWe believe that brand strength, product innovation, pricing actions, premiumization of its global portfolio and revitalization plan are likely to drive growth for Molson Coors. Earnings estimates for TAP’s current financial year have increased 6.4% to $4.34 over the past 30 days. Topping it, long-term growth of 4.2% and a VGM Score of B raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Procter &amp; Gamble PG, Conagra Brands CAG and Celsius Holdings CELH.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CAG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.2%, on average. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Conagra Brands’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests improvements of 7.1% and 16.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported number. The consensus mark for CAG’s earnings per share has moved up 3.4% in the past 30 days.Celsius Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). CELH specializes in commercializing healthier, nutritional functional foods, beverages and dietary supplements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CELH’s current financial-year sales indicates 67.9% growth, while earnings per share are expected to rise 154% from the year-ago reported figures. The company recorded an earnings surprise of 81.8% in the last reported quarter.Procter &amp; Gamble currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

And in my opinion is poised to send waves through the industry.This is the year the $12-billion boat battery market joins the green revolution.This is the year the transition to electric begins in earnest.And the first mover advantage is going to Vision Marine, which unveiled its E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor, with its proprietary PowerTrain technology, at the Paris Boat Show in December. And has since launched the new H2 Bowrider in partnership with Four Winns.Powered by Vision Marine’s E-Motion, the H2 Bowrider is the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.The H2e’s top speed is 35 knots (40mph), and while its official debut was in February, deliveries are set to start this summer.The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor.With its one-of-a-kind tech advantage, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marine’s E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.That’s a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.On Trend in the Trillion-Dollar Energy Transition ClimateVision Marine isn’t just on trend, it’s helping to set the trend.It was already out of the gates before anyone else even heard the whistle.Its proprietary tech aims to transform the boating industry.Story continuesIn 2022, global investment in the low-carbon energy transition hit a record $1.1 trillion, buoyed by an energy crisis and government policy action around the world.In fact, as noted by BloombergNEF: “In another first, investment in low-carbon technologies appears to have reached parity with capital deployed in support of fossil fuel supply.”While renewable energy was the largest sector in investment terms, topping a record $495 billion in 2022, electrified transport was a close second, with $466 billion spent, up an astounding 54% year-on-year.This is exactly what Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) is looking to capitalize on with the launch of its game-changing marine-grade battery and boat engines.Vision Marine’s business plan is to market its E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received hundreds of advance orders.And investors are poised to see the company collect its first revenues from the PowerTrain battery technology this year.But there is a second level in this revenue chain, as well: The $5-billion+ boat rental market.Vision Marine’s flagship Newport electric boat rental setup has launched with 35 boats and over 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin. That’s just the beginning.There are 8,000 marinas in the world, and 10,000 waterfront resorts and marinas, and Vision Marine is eyeing this huge playfield for rapid expansion of its electric rental segment–at a time when going electric has become a must for the environment.This year, they’ll be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model.By 2024, it’s full speed ahead with scaling. By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to be cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling will pick up the pace even faster.And there are some legendary names behind it lending confidence to its targeted goals, not to mention a string of design, engineering and manufacturing partnerships that bode well for production and marketing.The Next Challenge for SpeedboatsVision Marine’s E-Motion fully charges overnight with no additional infrastructure, has the highest horsepower in its class on the market, offers the first-ever custom design marine battery packs, and it all comes in at a lower cost than any competitors:E-Motion combines an advanced battery pack, inverter, and high-efficiency motor with proprietary union assembly between the transmission and the electric motor design and extensive control software. E-Motion technology used in this powertrain system is designed to improve the efficiency of the outboard powertrain and, as a result, increase both range and performance.Legend and First-Mover AdvantageDesigned by boating legend Ian Bruce, the father of the Laser, the world’s most popular sailing boat, Vision’s first motorboat  Bruce 22e set a record for the electric boat competition in the famed Lake of the Ozarks Shootout races in August last year after hitting a speed of 49 mph.CEO Mongeon took Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) from a private company to a NASDAQ listing, successfully raising capital to develop the company’s proprietary technology and commercialize it, earning VMAR the moniker “Tesla of the Sea”.Together, Vision Marine’s team has positioned the company to have a clear first-mover advantage, with the most powerful electric solution on the market.The company boasts zero debt, a highly profitable and growing rental division, first Powertrain revenue this year and expects cash-flow positive standing in 2024.There is comfort in both first-movers and legends from an investors’ standpoint. And Vision Marine is confident enough to have declared after winning the Ozarks Shootout electric-powered boat race and breaking a new record that it would race anyone, anywhere, to prove its propulsion tech is the most powerful in its class in the world.Here are a number of other companies investors should be looking at as the green technology boom continues:Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA): After a difficult 2022, things are looking up for Tesla. The Model Y emerged as the best-selling vehicle worldwide in the first quarter of 2023 and the company’s stock price has begun to rebound. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, recently hinted at exciting developments on the horizon for the company. While he did not unveil specific new products during the annual shareholder meeting, Musk confirmed that two exciting projects are in the pipeline, generating anticipation among investors and enthusiasts alike. Musk also made an unexpected announcement regarding Tesla's advertising strategy recently, expressing openness to exploring paid advertising, a departure from his previous stance against advertising.As Tesla gears up for the highly anticipated Cybertruck delivery event later this year, and with the promise of new products on the horizon, the company remains at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. With its visionary leadership, groundbreaking technology, and unwavering commitment to excellence, Tesla continues to shape the future of transportation and solidify its position as a global leader in the automotive industry.Ford (NYSE:F): Despite facing challenges in recent years, Ford is now making significant strides in the electric vehicle market. The company's electric vehicle unit reported losses in 2022 and projected potential losses in 2023. However, Ford remains optimistic about the future, aiming to turn its EV business into a profitable venture by the end of 2026. The company plans to increase EV production capacity to 2 million units per year by 2026, leading to improved profitability. Ford also expects to benefit from selling software and services to EV owners, cost improvements in raw materials, and other incremental gains.With a strong commitment to building an industry-leading portfolio of highly differentiated EVs, Ford aims to capitalize on its strengths in pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs. By embracing innovation, scaling production, and optimizing efficiency, Ford is positioning itself as a significant player in the electric vehicle revolution, poised to shape the future of transportation and solidify its position as a key player in the automotive industry.Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN): In a competitive market, Rivian is demonstrating resilience and solid demand for its vehicles, even in the face of increasing vehicle pricing. While competitors have been lowering prices to stimulate demand, Rivian stands out with an average selling price (ASP) increase in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year. With an ASP exceeding $83,000 per vehicle, Rivian's pricing power indicates strong demand, further reinforced by the company's growing backlog of reservations, which reached 114,000 in late 2022.Rivian's ability to maintain an increasing ASP is crucial as it continues to innovate and develop new technologies for its upcoming R2 models. The R2 platform, set to launch in 2024 as Rivian's first high-volume, mass-market vehicle, will come at a lower price point, making it even more appealing to a broader customer base. The company's solid liquidity position, highlighted by recent capital raises and credit facility expansions, sets it apart from many of its competitors, allowing Rivian to make substantial investments, including a new manufacturing plant in Georgia. While Rivian's stock has experienced volatility and a 25% drop this year, the company's enviable balance sheet, strong product adoption, and focus on improving efficiency could provide a compelling case for investors with an appetite for risk.General Motors (NYSE:GM): General Motors has emerged as a formidable competitor in the electric vehicle (EV) market, surpassing Ford in the first quarter of 2023. With a focus on scaling production and boosting its EV lineup, GM aims to solidify its position as a key player in the race to catch up with Tesla. In the first quarter, GM's EV sales soared to 20,670 units in the U.S., surpassing Ford's sales by nearly two to one. GM is scaling the production of its Ultium Platform and expects margin gains as a result.GM's strong performance in the first quarter can be attributed to record sales of the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV, along with upcoming launches of highly anticipated models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Blazer EV, and Equinox EV. The company plans to produce 50,000 EVs in the second quarter and double that production rate in the second half of the year, signaling its commitment to meeting growing demand. GM's impressive cash flow and earnings, along with the potential for increased dividend payouts, make it an interesting choice for investors seeking exposure to the EV market.Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB): Few companies have benefited from the electrification of transport as much as Albemarle, the world’s largest lithium producer, has. Despite facing headwinds from elevated raw material costs and demand weakness in specialties, Albemarle is strategically positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth of the battery-grade lithium market.In the first quarter of 2023, Albemarle saw higher volumes, supported by the La Negra III/IV expansion in Chile and an increase in tolling volumes. Additionally, the company's cost-saving and productivity initiatives are expected to support its margins throughout 2023. To meet the increasing demand for electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries, Albemarle recently announced the site for its lithium mega-flex facility in South Carolina. With an initial investment of $1.3 billion or more, the facility aims to produce approximately 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide annually, which can be increased to 100,000 metric tons. This capacity can support the production of about 2.4 million electric vehicles per year. The facility aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act and contributes to the localization of crucial minerals in North America. The company is also actively investing in projects in Western Australia and China to enhance its global lithium conversion capacity.Fisker (NYSE: FSR): After a long decline, Fisker’s stock price recently jumped as the company launched a financing website for its customers following the successful delivery of its first Fisker Ocean EV SUV. The fiskerfinance.com platform aims to provide a convenient and streamlined financing process for customers, covering all aspects from car loan applications to payment tracking. By facilitating the buying process, Fisker hopes to benefit from increased customer accessibility and convenience.With Fisker's vehicles hitting the roads, the introduction of the financing website is a logical step to support customers in purchasing their EVs. In a competitive market in which Tesla is currently cutting prices aggressively, Fisker’s ability to facilitate the purchase of its Fisker Ocean SUV, which has a commendable range of up to 440 miles on a full charge, could be a game-changer for the company.ChargePoint (NYSE: CHPT): A prominent player in the EV charging industry, ChargePoint operates across multiple countries and enjoys a strong position in the U.S. market. As the adoption of EVs continues to grow, ChargePoint is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. While ChargePoint has experienced declining profits, it has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth, ranging between 90% and 100% over the past five quarters. Analysts predict that the company will begin to reduce its losses by next year, presenting potential growth opportunities for investors.ChargePoint currently serves 80% of Fortune 50 companies, and as these businesses incorporate more EVs into their fleets, ChargePoint's revenue and profits are expected to increase and the company hopes to break into profitability within the next three years. The company’s Q1 financial results are set to be announced on June 1, 2023.Blink Charging (NASDAQ: BLNK): Another EV charging giant, Blink Charging has experienced a significant decline in share price, down approximately 70% from its previous highs, despite its unchanged long-term prospects. However, the company has secured new contracts for EV charging station deployments and is addressing overspending and executive compensation issues. Notably, Blink Charging has won a contract with the federal government through the GSA to provide EV charging stations, which could potentially result in an annual revenue boost of $20 million. Additionally, the company has obtained an IDIQ contract from the United States Postal Service to sell up to 14,500 charging stations, potentially generating around $20 million annually.Blink Charging has been focusing on improving its margins and reducing expenses. The company has been successful in raising prices while lowering the cost of generating revenues. Over the past four years, Blink Charging has been able to increase its gross margins, reaching approximately 33% in the most recent quarters. With a combination of price increases and cost reductions, the company aims to achieve a 35% gross margin in the long run, leading to a smoother path to profitability.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA): While most companies in the EV space are suffering from intense competition, Nvidia is taking advantage of it. The U.S. chip giant has become a key player in China's electric vehicle (EV) market as several Chinese automakers choose its technology to power their semi-autonomous driving systems. Start-ups Xpeng and Nio, as well as Baidu's auto unit Jidu and Geely's Polestar brand, have adopted Nvidia's Drive Orin chip for their latest vehicles. Nvidia's chipset and software platform offer the capabilities for fully autonomous driving, making it a highly attractive choice for Chinese EV companies.In China's fiercely competitive EV market, Nvidia is benefiting from the intensifying competition among automakers. Despite Tesla's strong brand presence and record sales in China, the American electric vehicle manufacturer designs its own semiconductors for its ADAS, called the Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip. This has opened up an opportunity for Nvidia, as Chinese EV players seek to close the perceived technology gap with Tesla by partnering with the chip giant. Nvidia's strong presence in the Chinese market and its strategic focus on expanding its auto chip business around FSD position it well to meet the demands of Chinese EV makers and capitalize on the growing market.QuantumScape (NYSE:QS): Focused on developing solid-state lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), QuantumScape presents an intriguing opportunity, albeit one with significant risk. The company's innovative battery technology has the potential to revolutionize the EV industry by enabling lighter, safer, and faster-charging batteries with longer life cycles. QuantumScape has made notable progress, with promising testing results for its 24-layer cell prototype, demonstrating high-level fast charging and minimal capacity loss. The company has received investments from major players like Volkswagen and has garnered interest from other auto companies. If QuantumScape successfully brings its products to market, it could witness explosive sales and earnings growth, leading to substantial returns for investors.The company is still in the pre-revenue stage, relying on prototype technologies, and faces challenges in terms of reliability and commercialization. Its substantial operating expenses and the need for significant capital expenditures highlight the financial uncertainties it faces. Additionally, QuantumScape is not the only player in the potentially revolutionary battery technologies space, as competitors like CATL, Toyota, Samsung, and others pose potential challenges. Scaling up manufacturing could prove costly and encounter unforeseen obstacles. Undoubtedly an exciting company in the space, but with plenty of risk associated.By.

Ford Motor (NYSE: F) is the first automaker to gain direct access to Tesla’s  Supercharging infrastructure, with its vehicles planned to contain Tesla’s charging DNA as of 2025 at which point they won’t even be needing an adapter to use Tesla Superchargers built around the NACS standard. With this suprising deal, Ford gained a significant lead over its Detroit peers, General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) whose cars are built on the current industry charging norm, CCS.During its annual GM Fleet Solutions Summit, General Motors has launched a new brand to serve fleet EV customers named ""Envolve"" With this launch, the legendary automaker stated it has entered a phase of accelerated expansion  as it will aiding corporate clients minimize their footprint, optimize their fleets and improve driver safety. The unveiling was positively received by AutoZone Inc (NYSE: AZO) CEO Bill Rhodes. What is interesting about this move is that automakers are clearly trying to differentiate themselves in serving all kinds of customers.GM’s peer, Stellantis N.V. recently celebrated the inaguration of its Europe gigafactory. Located in France, Stellantis joined forces with TotalEnergies and Mercedez-Benz to build this ACC battery gigafactory. Reuters reported the words of its CEO Carlos Tavares, who said that Stellantis will be needing one or even two additional battery plants in the U.S. to meet its EV output targets. Stellantis aims to achieve carbon net zero by 2038, with the French plant expected to produce high-performance lithium-ion batteries with a minimal CO2 footprint. Therefore, latest factory is the first of the three that Stellantis plans to open in Europe to power its electrification plans.Story continuesVolkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) is also accelerating its EV efforts. Through its subsidary, Electrify America, it is trying to build a charging network across the U.S. Interestingly, unlike Tesla, Volkswagen has not boarded the price discounting train in China. Reuters reported that Volkswagen Chief Operating Officer Ralf Brandstaette said in an interview that was releassed today Volkswagen won’t be entering the discount battle at any price, despite the surmounting pressure. Volkswagen still aspires to be the biggest international automaker in China but considering that this is the world’s largest market that is expected to grow from its present value of 22 million to a range between 28 to 30 million by the end of the decade,Brandstaetter finds it irrelevant if another national automaker sells more, like BYD that outsold Volkswagen during the first quarter of the year.Ford And Tesla Pact To Disrupt The EV UniverseThe deal between Tesla and Ford could easily be a game changer and result in NCAS becoming the new industry norm. Automakers like GM, Stellantis and Volkswagen have a big choice to make: will they stick to their playbooks and have less charging options, also keeping in mind that Tesla’s superchargers have been ranked as superior to others, or will they put their egos aside like Ford to prioritize their customers, offer them fast and convenient charging through an adaptor to access Tesla superchargers and together make a big step towards global EV adoption.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

243,50c800a6-4407-3bea-ab85-bec19be1846d,GM,2023-06-01,Investors Heavily Search General Motors Company (GM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-general-motors-130012350.html,1685538012,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this company have returned +0.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has gained 17.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +43.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.68 points to a change of -12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of -3.6% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.6%. The $163.85 billion and $165.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +1.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $39.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +34.76%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Associated Press)If there's a company in America you'd expect to have the gumption and spirit to see off a stupid and specious attack on the selling of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride Month in June, it would be Target.After all, the Minneapolis company is one of America's biggest retailers, racking up more than $100 billion a year in sales. Only two weeks ago, its chief executive, Brian Cornell, was boasting that ""our long-standing commitment to diversity, and equity, and inclusion ... has fueled much of our growth over the last nine years.""Yet when the braying mob of anti-LGBTQ+ reactionaries targeted Target, the company folded like a cheap, off-the-rack suit. It told personnel in many stores to shrink or even eliminate their Pride-themed merchandise displays or move them to less conspicuous sections of the stores. Some LGBTQ+ designers say their products have been taken off the shelves.Target explained its reaction by citing physical threats to its store workers from anti-LGBTQ+ militants. But something more is going on here, and Target's response doesn't show the company in a good light.The context is a concerted effort from the right wing to demonize the LGBTQ+ movement and thereby make any outreach or even acknowledgment of this community toxic for consumer businesses. The goal is to disappear these people and their advocates, reversing a decades-long trend toward acceptance, equity and inclusion.""Our long-standing commitment to diversity, and equity, and inclusion...has fueled much of our growth over the last nine years.""Target CEO Brian Cornell, just before the company downplayed its merchandising of Pride-themed goodsThe attacks take many forms, all of them chiefly employed by Republicans and their right-wing acolytes and all of them equally factitious.Sometimes LGBTQ+ people are accused of being pedophiles who ""groom"" children for abuse. Sometimes the anti-queer movement is cast as an arm of the right's attack on ""wokeness,"" which is just another way of promoting the idea that only straight white males count in this U.S. of A.Story continues     View this post on Instagram      A post shared by Ash + Chess (@ashandchess)Anti-""wokeness"" is the chief theme of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential ambition tour. As is well known, DeSantis has been on the warpath with Walt Disney Co., one of his state's leading employers and economic engines, over the company's public criticism of his so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" law, which suppresses classroom references to gender identity.(During his glitch-beleaguered May 24 presidential campaign launch on Twitter, DeSantis ludicrously accused Disney of ""trying to inject matters of sex into the programming for the youth.”)There's no evidence that anti-queer militants constitute anything but a tiny minority of the American public. When they act in concert and their efforts are fueled by social media, however, they can appear to be weightier than they are.That's probably what accounted for the pusillanimous reaction of Anheuser-Busch to a right-wing, social-media-driven campaign against its Bud Light beer, after the company's marketing department launched a publicity campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.Read more: Column: Corporate America's deafening silence on the Texas abortion lawAnheuser-Busch not only issued a wan statement of regret for the marketing outreach but also sidelined the two marketing executives responsible for the campaign. Given that their assignment had been to revive the brand's fading popularity, Anheuser-Busch's effective demotion of the executives signaled to the boycotters that their voices had been heard. That wasn't a positive corporate message, to say the least.Anheuser-Busch stock has fallen about 20% in the last two months, while the boycott has been in full cry. Target shares have fallen by about the same percentage since mid-May.To some extent, it's unfair to blame the far right for launching boycotts against brands they choose not to like. I've defended consumer boycotts in the past, in principle. But all boycotts are not created equal.There's a qualitative difference between those directed at noxious behavior, such as the open racism of Tucker Carlson or the bloodlust of the National Rifle Assn., and those directed at efforts to promote tolerance and equality. One knows boycotters by their boycottees.That brings us back to the companies' hasty responses. These have been widely misjudged. Alex Shepherd of the New Republic cursed ""total, preemptive capitulation"" by Anheuser-Bush and Target to the anti-LGBTQ+ boycotts as ""profoundly un-American.""If only they were. Corporate America's response to even a hint of controversy, no matter how specious the boycotters' objections, is as American as apple pie. As we've seen time and time again, consumer companies are notable not for their steadfastness in defending the public interest, but their cravenness. That's especially so when, as is the case with the Bud Light and Target campaigns, the context is overtly partisan.Remember all the companies that pledged to cease or at least suspend campaign contributions to the 147 Republican representatives and senators who voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election? Many, if not most, have gone back on their promise.Among them, according to ProPublica, are Home Depot, which by the end of 2022 had donated to 65 of the election deniers, and Boeing, which funded at least 74. Toyota, to give it begrudging credit, was at least candid about the thought process involved in resuming contributions to supporters of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection: It selected politicians that could carry its water in Washington.Read more: Column: The Tucker Carlson advertiser boycott continues, and what's wrong with that?“Toyota supports candidates based on their position on issues that are important to the auto industry and the company,” the company told me in June 2021. “We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification."" To put it another way, ""money talks, democratic principle walks.""Many corporations will say for the record that they believe in women's healthcare rights. But when a horrifically punitive antiabortion law went into effect in Texas in 2021, the silence from the corporate community was deafening. It still is; not a peep of protest has come from Texas-based big businesses such as American Airlines, Texas Instruments, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise — even though the law is certain to make recruiting women for important jobs harder for them.One problem in assessing the campaigns against Bud Light and Target is a lack of clarity about their results. It's hard to be sure whether Bud Light's continuing sales slump is due to the anti-woke publicity or to the fact that, not to be indelicate, the product tastes like it's been strained through a horse.Target muddied the waters in its own case by explaining that it minimized the displays of Pride-themed merchandise to protect its employees from violence.There are, of course, other ways to achieve that end, including by stepping up security in vulnerable stores and making clear that it will prosecute the hell out of anyone who commits or threatens to commit an assault on its premises.Target has also let it be known that the merchandise it removed from inventory was from a single British designer whose work has exploited satanic imagery. The company's website, anyway, is replete with Pride-themed goods.One would hope that companies that become objects of ideologically inspired campaigns like these don't think they can mollify the torch-bearing mob. If they think they can immunize themselves, they can take a lesson from the experience of Chick-fil-A.The fast-food chain became the target of localized boycotts in 2012, when CEO Dan Cathy publicly voiced the conviction that gay marriage violated God’s plan.Disappointing. Et tu Chik-fil-a? https://t.co/QXk4ZfOgWO— Jeff Clark (@JeffClarkUS) May 30, 2023Progressive politicians in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, among other places, threatened to ban Chick-fil-A stores from their jurisdictions. Calls for boycotts erupted on Facebook and Twitter. The company issued a statement disavowing Cathy's viewpoint as a matter of corporate policy. A sort of reverse boycott occurred, in the form of a one-day eat-in by company fans at Chick-fil-A stores.But the political environment has changed. Recently it became known that Chick-fil-A had appointed a vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion — in 2021. (Moreover, the VP is Black.) The discovery has inspired a new campaign for a boycott, this time from the right wing. One acolyte of Donald Trump tweeted, ""Disappointing. Et tu Chik-fil-A?""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Shares have lost about 6.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Hologic due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Hologic's Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates, 2023 View UpHologic reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06 in second-quarter fiscal 2023, down 48.8% year over year. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5%.The adjustments include charges and benefits related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain asset impairment charges and restructuring and integration/consolidation costs, among others.The company’s GAAP EPS were 87 cents in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s EPS of $1.80, reflecting a 51.7% plunge.Revenues in DetailRevenues totaled $1.03 billion in the reported quarter, declining 28.5% year over year (down 27.5% at the constant exchange rate or CER).

Outside the United States, Breast Health sales increased 42.5% at CER. The upside was driven by the improving semiconductor chip supply, enabling additional gantry deliveries within the quarter and resulting in higher capital equipment revenues compared with the prior-year period’s levels.Revenues in the GYN Surgical business rose 23.4% year over year (up 25.2% at CER) to $144.8 million, led by improved procedure volume as COVID prevalence declined.Revenues at Skeletal Health increased 51.2% year over year (up 53.4% at CER) to $31.6 million.Operational UpdateIn the fiscal second quarter, the company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 890 basis points (bps) to 62.1%. According to the company, the downside in gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 assay sales.The company’s adjusted operating margin was 31.3%, contracted 1610 bps.Financial UpdateHologic ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.58 billion compared with $2.34 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023.Total long-term debt (including the current portion) was $2.79 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter compared with $2.80 at the end of the fiscal first quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal second quarter was $459.7 million compared with $1.63 billion a year ago.GuidanceHologic issued the guidance for the third quarter and raised fiscal 2023 guidance.For fiscal 2023, the company projects revenues within $3.92-4.03 billion (up from the previous guidance of $3.85-4.00 billion), suggesting a year-over-year decline in the range of 19.3-17.2% on a reported basis, 18.5-16.4% at CER and 18.7-16.6% organically.

257,2a38ae4c-b8f1-3fc1-b943-ee1c3e75e22e,BXP,2023-06-01,Insiders Load Up on These 2 Dividend Stocks With Impressive Yields of 8% or More,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-load-2-dividend-stocks-015100325.html,1685584260,STORY,['BXP'],"[Saying ‘insider trading’ conjures up images of smoky back rooms and shady deals, but that’s only for the movies. In real life, insiders refer to corporate officers, such as CEOs, CFOs, COOs, and directors, who are responsible for running their companies profitably. They don’t take trading their own companies’ stocks lightly. While they may sell for various reasons, they only buy when they anticipate a rise in the share price.That makes the insiders’ trading moves one of the surest signs that investors can look for to predict a stock’s near- to mid-term movements. The insiders, by virtue of their positions, have advance information on the factors that will impact the shares, and regulatory authorities level the playing field by requiring insiders to publish their trades. Investors can watch for these publications, and stocks with strong insider buying are always worth a closer look.You can give the positive insider signals a boost by combining them with other factors closely linked to strong returns – like high dividend yields. Passive income is always a boon for investors, and when that passive income is yielding 8% or better, and the insiders are buying big, it’s a combination that demands attention.So let’s give these double-barreled stocks some of the attention they deserve. Using the Insiders Hot Stocks tool on TipRanks, we’ve found two stocks that are showing strong insider buying in recent days, along with dividend yields starting at 8% and going up from there. If that’s not enough, both stocks have also received support from Wall Street analysts. Let’s take a closer look.Owl Rock Capital (ORCC)We’ll start in the world of Business Development Companies, or BDCs. These financial firms offer their customers access to credit and capital. Their customer base consists of small- and medium-sized enterprises that have long been the drivers of the US economy. These firms don’t always have access to major banks, but Owl Rock and its peers provide the capital, credit, and loan facilities that these businesses need for growth, acquisitions, and market or product expansions.Story continuesThere are 187 of these mid-market firms in Owl Rock Capital’s investment portfolio, with a total fair market value in excess of $13 billion. Of Owl Rock’s investments in these firms, 98% are floating rate, and 85% are senior secured investments.It’s a quality portfolio that has contributed to ORCC’s rising earnings over the past year. In fact, the company’s latest quarter, 1Q23, showcased strong income that exceeded the Street’s forecasts by a wide margin. ORCC’s total investment income reached $377.6 million, representing a 42% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. Even better, the total investment income came in $12 million more than had been expected.At the bottom line, the net investment income (NII) came in at $177.8 million, or 45 cents per share. This was 14 cents per share higher than the 1Q22 figure – and it was 2 cents more than the analysts had predicted.The strong investment income supported a generous dividend. For the second quarter, the company has declared a regular dividend of 33 cents per common share, which is scheduled for payment on July 14. This regular dividend, when annualized, amounts to $1.32 and provides an impressive yield of 9.8%.On the insider trades, we find that company President and CEO Craig Packer, bought 75,600 shares of the company in May, paying about $1 million.The company’s top officer is hardly the only bull here; RBC Capital’s 5-star analyst Kenneth Lee writes of this stock: “ORCC could be on track to delivering 12%+ ROE this year. Credit performance in portfolio is still solid, in our view. We expect to gain further insight into ORCC’s investment approach and potential return profile through cycles at the upcoming investor day. We continue to favor ORCC as one of the few atscale BDCs, with an attractive valuation (0.85x NAV) and dividend yield (~10%).”In Lee’s view, this adds up to an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and he sets a price target of $15 to imply a one-year upside potential of ~12%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has 22% potential total return profile. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here)As far as Wall Street generally is concerned, ORCC gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 5 recent reviews that include 4 Buys and 1 Sell. (See ORCC stock forecast)Boston Properties (BXP)From BDCs we’ll shift gears and look at a company from another sector which is known for high dividends, a real estate investment trust. The REIT at hand is Boston Properties, a major player in the US workplace real estate segment. Boston Properties is the largest publicly traded developer, owner, and manager of such properties in the US.A look at some numbers will give the scale. Boston Properties counts 177 office properties in its portfolio, totaling 50 million square feet of leasable space. These properties are located in six urban regions, well known as some of the most desirable real estate in the US. BXP has holdings in its eponymous city of Boston, along with New York City, Washington DC, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The company’s largest presence, with 49 locations and 15.9 million square feet, is in Boston; Washington and New York are next, with 42 properties and 22.6 million square feet between them.Commercial real estate, especially in urban areas, is feeling pressure post-COVID. With many workers still commuting remotely, companies are trying to downsize their office spaces. But even in that difficult environment, BXP has kept up its revenues and earnings. The company’s top line in the most recent quarter, 1Q23, came to $803.2 million, capping nearly two years of consistent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. The Q1 total was also up 6.5% year-over-year, and beat expectations by $24.4 million.At the bottom line, there are several metrics to consider. BXP’s GAAP earnings of 50 cents missed the forecast by 4 cents and were 45% lower than the year-ago quarter’s EPS of 91 cents. Of more interest to dividend investors, however, BXP reported funds from operations (FFO) in 1Q23 of $1.73 per share, derived from a total of $272 million. While down from the year-ago quarter’s results ($1.82 per share and a total of $286.1 million), the current FFO was more than enough to fully fund the company’s dividend.The dividend was paid out near the end of April, for 98 cents per common share. BXP has held the dividend at this level since late 2019; the annualized rate of $3.92 per common share gives a strong yield of 8%.Taking a closer look at this firm’s insider trades, we discover that Carol Einiger, a member of the Board of Directors, recently acquired 10,000 shares, paying $474,100.Also bullish on the stock is Evercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa, who focuses on the company’s ability to generate funds.“After a couple of tweaks to our model, our ‘23 FFO est increases from $7.15 to $7.18 driven by slightly higher base rent and lower op expenses which compares to our new FY24 estimate of $7.58 which reflects slightly more conservative operating expenses… We maintain our Outperform rating given the company’s quality portfolio, healthy balance sheet and robust development pipeline to drive long-term value in an otherwise challenged office sector,” Sakwa opined.That Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating comes with a $67 price target that implies growth of ~38% for the year ahead. (To watch Sakwa’s track record, click here.)Overall, of the 12 most recent analyst reviews on record here, 5 are to Buy and 7 to Hold – giving the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Shares have added about 6.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Credit Acceptance due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Credit Acceptance Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates as Revenues DeclineCredit Acceptance’s first-quarter 2023 earnings of $7.61 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.80 by a significant margin. The bottom line reflects a 49% fall from the prior-year quarter. These figures include certain non-recurring items. Our estimate for earnings was $10.86.Results were adversely impacted by marginally lower revenues and higher operating expenses. Also, higher provisions for credit losses were an undermining factor. However, the rise in consumer loan assignment volume acted as a tailwind.Excluding non-recurring items, net income was $127 million or $9.71 per share, down from $197.3 million or $13.76 per share in the prior-year quarter. Our estimates for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were $171 million and $13.06 per share, respectively.GAAP Revenues Decline, Operating Expenses RiseTotal GAAP revenues were $453.8 million, down marginally year over year. Lower finance charges, premiums earned and other income mainly resulted in the revenue decline. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $457.3 million. Our estimate for revenues was $442.1 million.Provision for credit losses was $137.4 million, up substantially from $23.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric was $99.6 million.Operating expenses of $117.3 million increased 14.4% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2023, net loans receivable were $6.5 billion, up 3.2% from the December 2022 level. Total assets were $7.15 billion as of the same date, up 3.6%. Total shareholders’ equity was $1.72 billion, up 6.1%.In the reported quarter, consumer loan assignment volumes in terms of units and dollar volumes rose 22.8% and 18.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesShare Repurchase UpdateIn the reported quarter, Credit Acceptance repurchased 33,035 shares.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.27% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Credit Acceptance has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Credit Acceptance has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCredit Acceptance is part of the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry. Over the past month, Navient (NAVI), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Navient reported revenues of $253 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.3%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Canadian National Railway Co. CNI, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC and CSX Corp. CSX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Are Railroad Companies Becoming More Employee Friendly?The Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being weighed down by challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel prices and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 4% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.7% appreciation and 2.4% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, it has been an encouraging move on railroad companies’ part to take care of employees’ needs by entering into collective deals with the unions. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co., Union Pacific Corp., Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. have tried to address their employees’ requirements through multiple initiatives such as by increasing their paid sick leaves, offering them better working schedules to ensure a balanced personal and professional life and improving working conditions.Each of the abovementioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Canadian National recently announced that its collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) has been ratified. The union represents almost 6,000 Canadian National locomotive engineers, conductors, yard conductors and yard coordinators working in Canada.Story continuesTracy Robinson, president and chief executive officer of CNI, stated, “We are pleased that TCRC members have ratified the collective agreement reached earlier this year. We thank the TCRC leadership for their engagement throughout this process.  We remain committed to working with this important group to ensure continued service for our customers and improved working conditions for our team members.""Union Pacific has entered into a tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The deal is aimed at improving the quality of life for Union Pacific’s locomotive engineers and their families by offering them better working schedules.UNP employs nearly 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET. The tentative deal offers locomotive engineers 11 days on and four days off schedule. This deal should help UNP progress productively with its employees with the new work/rest schedules.Norfolk Southern has entered into an agreement with BLET, aimed at offering up to seven paid sick days per year to BLET members. This deal will offer five new days of paid sick leave per year to Norfolk Southern engineers. Further, it will also provide them the flexibility to use up to two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.The deal covers more than 3,300 Norfolk Southern engineers, representing almost 25% of the NS craft workforce. With this agreement, almost all the company's craft employees — approximately 98% — have entered into paid sick leave deals.CSX announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division CSRA (SMART-TD CSRA), aimed at offering paid sick leave benefits. This deal (which is pending ratification by union members) is the 10th one between CSX and its union-represented employees since February. Most of CSX’s unionized workers now have paid sick leave benefits.SMART-TD CSRA represents trainmen, conductors and yardmen on territories of CSX’s Atlanta and West Point railroad, Winston-Salem Southbound railway, Louisville and Nashville railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad.Such agreements reflect the employee-friendly attitude of the railroad companies through which they try to maintain cordial relations with employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere. These efforts should also help the companies retain and recruit more employees.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 0.61% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.41%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10.45%.Heading into today, shares of the global payments processor had lost 2.35% over the past month, lagging the Business Services sector's gain of 0.85% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.05% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Visa as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $2.10 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 6.06%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.05 billion, up 10.64% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.58 per share and revenue of $32.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of +14.4% and +10.93%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.17% higher within the past month. Visa currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Visa is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 25.82. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.29.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that V has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

269,0db9448d-729f-342c-ab61-67bfe4e87b27,NWSA,2023-06-01,Realtor.com® May Housing Report: Home Price Gains Slow to Lowest Rate on Record,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-may-housing-report-100000396.html,1685613600,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[In May, home price growth slowed to 0.9% year over year, as active inventory decreased in 21 out of 50 of the largest metros SANTA CLARA, Calif., June 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Home prices rose slightly in May, but price growth slowed to the lowest rate on record since 2016, suggesting home prices may not see a new peak in 2023, according to the Realtor.com® Monthly Housing Trends Report released today. Additionally, home inventory growth continues to slow and is declining in many metro areas across the country as fewer sellers list their homes than last year and buyers compete over the remaining affordable homes for sale.""April and May are historically popular months to buy, and typically by this time in the year we've exceeded the prior year's peak home price. Weakening home price growth for the past 12 months is increasing the odds that we may not see a new home price peak this year, for the first time in the history of our listing data, which dates back to mid-2016, and this is likely welcome news to homeshoppers,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Despite stalling price growth, home listing prices are up slightly compared to last May, and with rates more than a percentage point higher than a year ago, buyers continue to face affordability headwinds. The good news for sellers is that buyers are still out there, and this month's slower growth in the active inventory of homes for sale indicates that shoppers are in the market and actively searching for homes that fit their needs and budget.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketA slower housing market means buyers in certain areas may find they can once again have an offer accepted when putting less down. A recent report from Realtor.com® found down payments declined for the first time since the second quarter of 2020, suggesting it's getting harder for buyers to keep up with costs and that a less competitive housing market may be opening up opportunities for buyers making somewhat smaller down payments. Fortunately, there are a number of down payment assistance programs also available to help buyers, who can search for programs using this tool on Realtor.com®.Story continues""As buyers' budgets are being stretched to the max, there are opportunities for negotiation, especially on homes that have been sitting on the market for a while,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""They can ask sellers to come down on the price, make costly repairs, as well as contribute to their closing costs or buy down their mortgage rates. If they're purchasing new construction, they can also request upgrades. This can add up to substantial savings.""May 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over May 2022Change over May 2019Median listing price+0.9% (to $440,000)+38.0 %Median listing price per square foot-0.3% (to $225)+47.1 %Active listings+21.5 %-50.7 %New listings-22.7 %-30.4 %Median days on market+14 days (to 43 days)-9 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+2.6 percentage points (to 12.7%)-2.6 percentage points Home price growth stallsHome listing prices were slightly higher in May compared to a year ago, but growth in the typical asking price of for-sale homes continued to decline to the low single digits. In addition, the median listing price on a square foot basis declined compared to last year for the first time in Realtor.com® data history. At this rate of slowing, asking prices are likely to decline relative to the previous year by next month. Despite this trend, home sellers continue to have high expectations of the housing market and buyers, in some cases, too high. The number of homes with price reductions – a sign that a seller needed to adjust pricing to attract a buyer – was higher than year ago levels but in line with pre-pandemic years.The U.S. median list price grew to $441,000 in May, up from $430,000 in April, and down -1.7% from June 2022's record high of $449,000. The annual growth rate slowed to +0.9% in May, down from April's 2.5% growth rate, to the lowest price growth in our records since 2016.Nationally, the median listing price per square foot declined (-0.3%) compared to the previous year for the first time in our data history since 2016.Higher mortgage rates and home prices compared to May of last year increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $296 (+15.5%) compared to a year ago.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 15 out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline. The greatest price declines were seen in Texas metros: Austin (-7.3% year over year), Houston (-5.9%), and San Antonio (-5.8%).Nationally, 12.7% of active listings had their price reduced in May, up from 10.2% in May of last year. While higher than last year, the rate is below typical 2017-2019 levels. Large southern metros saw the largest increase in the percentage of homes with price reductions, led by Austin, Texas (+11.9 percentage points year over year), San Antonio, Texas (+9.1 percentage points) and Oklahoma City, Okla. (+8.7 percentage points).Inventory tightens as fewer sellers list and buyers compete over remaining homes The U.S. supply of active homes for sales continued to grow in May relative to this time last year, but slowed for the third month in a row as fewer potential sellers opted to list their home for sale and as the market lapped the period of higher inventory growth that started in May 2022. Today's buyers are grappling with low inventory, but the slowing growth in active inventory in May indicates that buyers continue to search for and find deals. Despite sitting on relatively high home equity, sellers are staying on the sidelines, and the number of newly listed homes remains well below last year's level. In fact, the pace of new home listings in May was even lower than in May 2020 when the real estate market was still contending with pandemic-era closures and restrictions.Nationally, the number of active listings grew +21.5% year over year in May; however, the inventory growth rate continued to slow for the third month in a row. Both newly listed homes (-22.7%) and homes under contract (-18.1%), or pending listings, declined year over year.Compared to last year, active inventory decreased in 21 out of 50 of the largest metros. Markets that reported large yearly declines included San Jose, Calif. (-35.3%), Sacramento, Calif. (-27.3%), and Hartford, Conn. (-26.0%).Among the 50 largest metros, active inventory increased 20.8% over last year, driven exclusively by Southern metros, such as Nashville, Tenn. (+124.7%); Austin, Texas (+112.5%), and San Antonio, Texas (+93.4%). Despite high inventory growth compared to last year, most Southern metros still had lower inventory levels compared to pre-pandemic years.On average across the 50 largest metros, no region or metro area saw year-over-year increases in new listings in May. The South saw new listing activity decline the least (-20.4%) compared to the previous year, while they fell 32.9% in the West, 22.9% in the Northeast, and 22.8% in the Midwest.More days on market gives buyers time to search for homes and bargainIn May, the typical home spent two weeks longer on the market than the same time last year, but a shrinking difference since January's recent high suggests buyers are out shopping for homes and competition still exists. That's keeping sellers in a very good position, with well-priced, updated homes still attracting buyers and selling more than a week faster than was common before the pandemic.In May, the typical home spent 43 days on market, 14 days longer than this time last year, but 9 days faster than the pre-pandemic May 2017-2019 average.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, the typical home spent 37 days on the market, 13 days more than the previous May. This trend was seen across all regions, with larger metros in the South seeing the greatest increase (+16 days), followed by the West (+12 days), Midwest (+9 days) and Northeast (+7 days).All of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the previous year. Time on market increased the most in Raleigh (+31 days), Austin (+28 days), and Miami (+27 days).May 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

The technology index is still up about 22% so far this year.""They've had an incredible run, so those valuation concerns are starting to manifest themselves,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.Adding to investor worries, May consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest since November as a standoff to raise the federal government's borrowing cap fanned worries about the economic outlook.Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rates hikes could push the economy into recession.According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.48 points, or 0.16%, to end at 4,124.14 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 43.76 points, or 0.35%, to 12,284.74.

The award builds on Verizon’s existing technology and positions Verizon as the USPS’ key strategic contact center and customer experience partner.Under the terms of the agreement, Verizon will deliver a number of infrastructure upgrades, including a transition to cloud solutions supported by real-time reporting, monitoring and administration, as well as ongoing physical infrastructure enhancements for host servers, storage arrays, and other equipment. Verizon’s solutions will help eliminate the need for premise infrastructure, software licenses, or hardware, thereby reducing the burden on USPS’ IT personnel and lowering operational costs. Verizon’s technology solutions will deliver an agile, robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure that will provide significant business value in the near term and prepare USPS strategically for the future.Additionally, the migration to the new cloud platform will expedite USPS’ integration of artificial intelligence capabilities, which will improve customer satisfaction by providing more intelligent, high-quality responses to inquiries. Verizon will also help USPS move to a multichannel platform that supports email, SMS, chat and more.Verizon will provide support for 80 million annual interactions with 4,500 contact center agents across 10 business units.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in San Jose include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity, as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. Over 65% of sites serving San Jose now provide 5G Ultra Wideband service. Most recently, Verizon engineers have added 5G coverage near Almaden Expressway and the Camden Avenue area in Southern San Jose, along I-280 between I-880 and Hwy 85, along I-680 at Calaveras in Milpitas, along Trimble Road near Hwy 101, around Lafayette Street just east of Great America, and along Santa Teresa Boulevard and Monterey Road near Leavesley Road in Gilroy.San Jose’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers have been using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in San Jose will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in San Jose. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the San Jose area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“Whether our customers are enjoying connecting with friends and family while on the move, connecting their smart homes through one of our home internet products or using our service in San Jose for small business or enterprise applications, we know customers count on us,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our team has been working hard in San Jose to deliver these results, and we are not slowing down.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.San Jose, CA customers have an outstanding experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having an outstanding experience on the Verizon network in San Jose, PA according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

Due to supply chain issues, bloated inventories, inflationary pressures, and weaker demand, the Company badly missed its original 2022 guidance. With recessionary fears, waning earnings momentum, a more elevated leverage profile, and reliance on the U.S. construction market, it is of no surprise how poorly the stock price behaved last year. In our view, the sell-off has been excessive with the stock price trading near March 2020 pandemic lows and at levels otherwise not seen since early 2014.

Jamestown (New York) Engine Plant wants to set the standard for plants across the U.S. as it makes progress on the company's goal of having a net positive impact on local communities.Part of Cummins' PLANET 2050 environmental sustainability strategy is the 2030 goal to reduce absolute water consumption in facilities and operations by 30%. Plants like Cummins Mid-Range Engine Plant in Columbus, Indiana, for example, have removed their 6.7 turbo diesel engine coating process to help reduce their water consumption.Sustainability leaders at Jamestown, however, hope to achieve this goal by eliminating 100% of potable water for irrigation, and reusing 100% of fire sprinkler test water and 100% of treated wastewater. Recycling and reusing wastewater through the science of reverse osmosis will be one of the largest initiatives in plant history.Reverse osmosis is a technology that separates potable water from the outgoing waste streams by removing contaminants. This process is a major water-saver at the plant.In 2022, the plant used 16 million gallons of fresh water, a 59% reduction in total water usage since 2016. Of that 16 million gallons, approximately 8 million gallons left as wastewater to the local sewer system for treatment. The reverse osmosis system provides the potential to recycle or reuse 80% of that outgoing water, which goes a long way towards meeting Cummins' 2030 water reduction goals.""If we want 30% to 50% water reduction at the plant, the reverse osmosis (process) is what gets us there,"" said the plant's Machining Director of Operations David Burlee.This is no easy feat, as a significant amount of effort is required to maintain a reverse osmosis system at its peak efficiency. Water is extracted and reused in the deionizer water process, which removes the metals, calcium and magnesium that are normally in city water.Story continues""City water has a lot of minerals that we need to take out. The beauty of the (reverse osmosis) system is that it removes 98% of it,"" Burlee said. ""We don't want minerals in our water because when it evaporates, it leaves behind all that as scale - and we don't want that in our cooling systems.""Before the introduction of reverse osmosis, wastewater needed to be regenerated - a process that creates giant vats of acidic and caustic waste that requires treatment - every three or four days. Now, the water is fed into the deionizer where it can run for weeks before it needs to be regenerated, reducing the production of the acids and caustics associated with regeneration.Today, 80% of deionized water used in the factory process is from the reverse osmosis system.""Our plant is a case study to show that it is viable to implement green energy solutions or energy conservation measures in a workplace such as ours with heavy machine manufacturing,"" Burlee said.Burlee said the more significant impact comes with long-term viability. With machinery purchases, the return on investment is usually one to two years. The return on investment for green energy solutions, however, is usually closer to eight to 10 years.""You're in it for the long haul. You've got to play the long game,"" Burlee said. ""The technology fits our manufacturing profile. So as long as up-front financials can be overcome, a business can see the long-term benefits of these things.""Cummins Inc., Wednesday, May 31, 2023, Press release pictureCummins' Jamestown Engine Plant is located in Western New York.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758405/Cummins-Inc-Plant-Commits-to-Reducing-Wastewater-Through-Reverse-Osmosis]"

You can receive discounts on merchandise, complimentary parking and add-on options like unlimited Disney PhotoPass downloads, depending on the type of annual pass you purchase.Is the magic of these perks worth the price tag? GOBankingRates spoke to Donna Malik, owner at Destination Magic, about why she chooses to purchase an annual pass despite being eligible for free and discounted Disney tickets. Here’s what makes Disney’s annual pass a great investment.Investing in the Disney Sorcerer PassFor over 20 years, Malik has been a regular visitor at Disney World. Malik is a member of the Disney Vacation Club and took her love of Disney travel to the next level in 2018 when she started working as a travel agent. Now, Malik is the owner of Destination Magic, a boutique travel agency specializing in Disney destinations.Mailk, who has had all types of Disney tickets over the years, has the Disney Sorcerer Pass, which is priced at $969 plus tax online. (Malik purchased her pass for $899 using Disney Vacation Club benefits.)While the pass does have a few blackout dates around Easter and Christmas, Malik doesn’t mind because these are typically the busiest times of year at the parks. However, if she ever changes her mind and wants to visit with her family during these peak seasons, she can upgrade the Disney Sorcerer Pass and gain access.“It’s like having the best of both worlds,” she said.$2,000 Quarter? Check Your Pockets Before You Use This 2004 CoinMagical Perks of a Disney Annual PassAside from the ability to gain access to the park during its peak season, Malik said there are even more great perks she receives with her annual pass. Some include discounts on rooms, restaurants and Disney merchandise, plus early access to special events.Story continuesThe greatest annual pass incentive, however, tends to go largely unspoken. It gives parkgoers like Malik their freedom.“We no longer feel like we have to spend every waking moment at the park to make the most of a single day ticket,” Malik said. “With our pass, we have the flexibility to come and go as we please. Sometimes we’ll pop into a park just for an hour or two, or maybe we’ll visit a specific park for a restaurant we’ve been craving. It’s all about savoring the experience and not feeling like we’re wasting a precious ticket.”Because of the Sorcerer Pass, she finds herself visiting Disney World more than she would have without it. Malik, who lives with her family in New Jersey, sometimes will plan shorter trips to the parks for just a few days. She calculates that as long as she and her family visit at least 10 times each year, they will have gotten their money’s worth.“The great thing about the annual pass is it gives us the lowest cost per day compared to individual park tickets,” Malik said. “It’s like unlocking a magical budget-friendly option for extended Disney adventures!”The Renewal Price AdvantageOver the last 20 years, Malik said there have been years when she and her family have bought the annual pass and others when they have not. This decision is typically made when evaluating the family travel plans for the year ahead.Despite the expense of an annual pass, Malik still chooses to purchase it over standard tickets for a few reasons. The first is she believes the benefits, including the flexibility in visiting and sense of freedom, far outweigh the expense. The second is the unbeatable renewal price, which Malik said is even better than the initial purchase.Is an Annual Pass Right for You?As a travel agent, Malik said she often speaks with visitors who are taking a once-in-a-lifetime Disney trip or who visit the parks every few years. In these situations, it might not make sense to invest in an annual pass. However, parkgoers who plan to visit even just once a year may find an annual pass is a fantastic option.Having an annual pass, she said, allows them to spread out the cost and make their visit truly worthwhile. This is also true of any parkgoers who may find they can benefit from an annual pass and make the most of their vacation.Those still uncertain whether an annual pass is right for them are recommended by Malik to get in touch with a Disney travel specialist. But for Malik and her family, having the Disney Sorcerer Pass — and being members of the Disney Vacation Club — has been the best decision.“The flexibility, perks and sense of freedom it offers are truly priceless,” Malik said. “It is a magical investment.”More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Vote for Your Favorite3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m a Disney Annual Pass Holder: Here’s Why It’s a Great Investment]"

""It's really not fair for companies to attempt to take advantage of that and not fairly compensate performers when they're using their persona in that way.""Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves already have been the subject of widely viewed unauthorized deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms. Reeves called the technology ""scary,"" in part because it can be deployed without actors' input.Interest in generative AI exploded globally after the November launch of ChatGPT, the fastest growing app of all time, by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI. U.S. and European regulators have demanded guardrails to prevent misinformation, bias, violation of copyrights and invasion of privacy.Actors and writers envision various scenarios in which studios could try to cut costs and boost revenue using generative AI, which can be fed existing material and pump out new content. The technology already is used to erase age marks or alter mouth movements to sync with words when programming is dubbed in various languages.Story continuesActor Leland Morrill said he has worked on sets where he was surrounded by cameras taking pictures from all angles.""With that type of content, they could use you for part of it, and then create the rest of the character, and then we're not on set anymore and nobody gets paid,"" Morrill said at a multi-union rally in Los Angeles.Producer, writer and former ""Family Ties"" actor Justine Bateman, holds a degree in computer science and has been sounding the alarm about AI. She said companies could allow fans to make their own ""Star Wars"" movie, and add themselves for an extra fee.Or, a studio could take footage from a popular 1980s TV show such as ""Family Ties"" and make a new season with AI.YOUNGER YOUSome actors have signed off on specific uses of AI.The upcoming ""Indiana Jones"" movie features scenes where 80-year-old star Harrison Ford appears 40 years younger. He said Walt Disney Co's Lucasfilm used images of his face that were shot during ""Indiana Jones"" films in the 1980s.""It's fantastic,"" Ford raved about his youthful on-screen appearance in an interview with late-night host Stephen Colbert.James Earl Jones, now 92, agreed to allow AI to replicate the menacing voice he gave to Darth Vader, according to Vanity Fair, so the character could live on. AI helped Disney put the late Carrie Fisher in 2019 film ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" with the blessing of her daughter.SAG-AFTRA's Crabtree-Ireland said actors have varying comfort levels with how AI is used, which is why the union will advocate for informed consent in talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the group that represents Disney, Netflix Inc and other studios.A representative for the AMPTP had no comment on its position on use of AI with actors.In negotiations with the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the AMPTP proposed discussing the topic once a year, which the Guild viewed as an attempt to avoid the issue. The WGA has been on strike over AI and compensation since May 2.If SAG-AFTRA cannot reach a deal on AI and other issues, actors also could go on strike, which would pile more pressure on the studios. Ahead of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA leaders have asked members to provide authorization to call a strike if needed. Voting on a strike authorization ends Monday.Both unions want safeguards in place before AI becomes widely used.Bateman, a former SAG board member, derides AI as ""automatic imitation"" that could lead to a future filled with rehashed entertainment from the past.""I don't want to live in that world,"" Bateman said. ""What's the next genre in film? What's the next genre in music? You're never going to see anything like that if we're all using AI.""

300,9a2e16bd-4054-35ac-bd78-f0be024c871a,DIS,2023-06-01,LGBTQ+ people flock to Florida for Gay Days festival,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lgbtq-people-flock-florida-gay-042903137.html,1685593743,STORY,['DIS'],"[ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ people are flocking to central Florida this weekend to go on theme park rides, mingle with costumed performers, dance at all-night parties and lounge poolside at hotels during Gay Days, a decades-long tradition.Even though Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida lawmakers have championed a slew of anti-LGBTQ+ laws — spurring the most prominent gay rights group in the U.S. and other civil rights organizations to issue warnings the Sunshine State may no longer be safe — Gay Days organizers are still encouraging visitors from around the world to come to one of Florida's largest gay and lesbian celebrations.They say a large turnout will send a message that LGBTQ+ people are not going away in Florida, which is continually one of the most popular states for tourists to visit. If the hoped-for 150,000 or more visitors come to the half-week of pool parties, drag bingo and thrill rides at Orlando's theme parks and hotels, then “that's the point,” said Joseph Clark, CEO of Gay Days Inc.“Right now is not the time to run. It’s not the time to go away,” Clark said. “It’s time to show we are here, we are queer and we aren’t going anywhere.”Unlike most of the country, which celebrates Pride in June, Orlando holds its Pride in October. Gay Days is a bonus celebration.It's not lost on the organizers that the highlight of the weekend will be a Saturday meetup of LGBTQ+ visitors at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, where the first Gay Days started as a single-day celebration in 1991. Traditionally, participants wear red shirts to identify themselves, and they meet for the afternoon parade in front of Cinderella’s Castle.Currently, Disney is embroiled in a legal fight with DeSantis over the governor and Republican lawmakers' takeover of Disney World's governing district — after Disney officials publicly opposed legislation that critics have dubbed “Don't Say Gay.”At first, the law banned classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity up to third grade, but this year it was expanded to apply to all grades. On top of that, Florida lawmakers recently passed bills making it a felony to provide gender-affirming health care to transgender minors, as well as banning people from entering bathrooms other than their sex assigned at birth, and prohibiting children from some performances, which takes aim at drag shows.Story continuesThe administration of DeSantis, who launched a campaign for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination last week, also moved to revoke the liquor licenses of a Miami hotel and a performing arts center owned by the Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation after they hosted drag shows where investigators claim minors were present.In response, some Florida cities, including St. Cloud near Orlando, have canceled Pride events altogether.“These laws have created a climate of fear and hostility for LGBTQIA+ people in Florida,” organizers for St. Cloud's Pride events wrote to announce the cancellation. “We believe that holding an LGBTQIA+ event in this environment would put our community at risk.”Responding to Florida's new laws and policies, the Human Rights Campaign — the largest LGBTQ+ rights organization in the U.S. — recently issued a travel and relocation warning for the state, joining the NAACP, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Equality Florida.While the LGBTQ+ advocacy group said it wasn’t calling for a boycott of all travel to Florida, it said it wanted to highlight new laws passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature that they said are hostile to the LGBTQ+ community and restrict abortion access, as well as make the state unsafe for many by allowing people to carry concealed weapons without a permit.Some participants in the Pride Cup athletic competitions at Gay Days decided not to come, forcing the cancellation of dodgeball and flag football tournaments. But the multi-sport competition that is held annually at Gay Days will still have beach volleyball, golf, pickleball and kickball.Even before these travel advisories were issued, some regular Florida visitors were reconsidering their plans. Sara Haynes, who lives in metro Atlanta with her husband, decided not to visit the state after lawmakers started planning legislation to restrict treatment options for trans people.“It’s less a crusade and more like, ‘I’m not going to spend my money where bad things are going on,’” Haynes said.But the organizers of Gay Days and their supporters say that Orlando is as gay-friendly a city as they come, earning a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign index, which measures how inclusive cities are of LGBTQ+ residents and visitors. They say tourists can support the LGBTQ+ community by visiting cities like Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and St. Petersburg, which also received perfect scores.“We live in a bubble here in Orlando, where even with the chaos in Florida, we feel safe here,” said Jeremy Williams, editor-in-chief of Watermark Publishing Group Inc., a Florida-based media company that is one of the sponsors of Gay Days.Gay Days has survived past challenges, including in the early years when Disney posted signs at the Magic Kingdom's entrance warning visitors there was a large gathering of gays and lesbians and offering passes to other parks for guests who might be offended. Over the last three decades, though, the theme parks and resorts have thrown down the welcome mats as Gay Days has become a profitable bounce between the spring break and out-of-school summer crowds. SeaWorld’s water park, Aquatica, is a sponsor this year.Other groups have adopted hostile attitudes in the past. During Gay Days in the 1990s, hundreds of anti-abortion activists with Operation Rescue protested outside Walt Disney World, and the Southern Baptist Convention cited the gathering in calling for a boycott of all things Disney. Some Christian groups tried to buy air time during Gay Days in the late 1990s to pressure people to renounce their sexual orientation, but mainstream TV stations in Orlando rejected the ads.If Clark, the CEO of the Gay Days business, had his wish, DeSantis would accept an open invitation to see one of the drag shows during this year's festivities.“Come on out and see that not everything you hear out there is reality,” said Clark, as if he were directly addressing DeSantis. “There’s a part of me that hopes that if he were to see a show, maybe his mind would change, or maybe he would see the people his actions are affecting.”___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Shares have added about 6.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Transocean due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Transocean's Q1 Loss Wider Than EstimateTransocean reported a first-quarter 2023 adjusted net loss of 38 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 20 cents. This underperformance can be attributed to a weaker result from Harsh Environment floaters.The bottom line also deteriorated from the year-ago period’s recorded loss of 28 cents.Total adjusted revenues of $649 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642 million. The top line also improved 5.5% from the prior-year figure of $615. This outperformance was primarily driven by higher operational days.Segmental Revenue BreakupTransocean’s Ultra-deepwater floaters contributed 74.6% to net contract drilling revenues, while Harsh Environment floaters accounted for the remaining 25.4%. Revenues from the Ultra-deepwater and Harsh Environment floaters totaled $484 million and $165 million, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter’s reported figures of $390 million and $196 million.Revenue efficiency was 97.8%, lower than 98.0% reported sequentially but higher than the year-ago quarter’s 94.9%.Dayrates, Utilization &amp; BacklogAverage dayrates in the reported quarter increased to $364,100 from $334,500 in the year-ago quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $340,000.Average revenues per day from Ultra-deepwater floaters increased to $360,000 from $305,600 in the year-ago quarter. The same from Harsh Environment floaters, however, decreased to $376,000 from $399,100 in the comparable period of 2022.Story continuesFleet utilization rate was 51.9% in the quarter, which reduced marginally from the prior-year period’s 52.7%.Transocean’s backlog of $8.6 billion increased sequentially from $6.1 billion.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetOperations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs decreased to $409 million from $412 million a year ago. The company spent $81 million on capital investments in the first quarter. Cash used in operating activities stood at $47 million. Cash and cash equivalents were $747 million as of Mar 31, 2023. Long-term debt amounted to $7.34 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 41.6% as of the same date.GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2023, Transocean expects adjusted contract drilling revenues of $735 million. It also projects O&amp;M expenses at approximately $460 million for the same time frame.For full-year 2023, the company expects operations and maintenance expenses of $1.9 billion. It also anticipates adjusted contract revenues in the $2.9-$3 billion range.RIG expects net interest expenses for the second quarter in the range of $118-$479 million.Capital Expenditure (capex) is projected at $100 million, which includes $70 million related to new builds and $30 million for maintenance capex in the second quarter.   Cash taxes are expected at about $15 million for the same quarter and roughly $35 million for full-year 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Transocean has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Transocean has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerTransocean belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry. Another stock from the same industry, Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP), has gained 4% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Helmerich &amp; Payne reported revenues of $769.22 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.5%.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed.

Looking at Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 28%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceIn the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Colgate-Palmolive.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 43%. However it looks like Colgate-Palmolive might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 34% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.On a separate note, we've found   3 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive   you'll probably want to know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ: MU), one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies and the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory, will break ground at the future site of its Childcare Center in Idaho and formalize the Idaho Community Investment Framework today, alongside Idaho Governor Brad Little and Boise Mayor Lauren McLean. The Idaho Community Investment Framework reflects the shared priorities Micron and its partners have identified to lead inclusive growth across the state.Micron’s previously announced plans to invest $15 billion through the end of the decade to construct a new fab for leading-edge memory manufacturing in Boise, Idaho, was made possible by the anticipated federal grants and tax credits from the CHIPS and Science Act. This will be the first new memory manufacturing fab built in the U.S. in 20 years and is expected to create nearly 17,000 Idaho jobs. Micron is committed to building and preparing the workforce of the future to meet the scale required for leading-edge memory manufacturing and ensure U.S. technology leadership.Today’s ceremonial groundbreaking of Micron’s Childcare Center marks the company’s progress towards plans to address the need for high-quality, affordable childcare. Operated by the Treasure Valley Family YMCA, the world-class childcare facility will provide STEM-based programming. The center, located across from Micron’s corporate headquarters and future fab, will grant easy access for parents to their children, help to address barriers to workforce entry and ease the transition for Micron employees, especially mothers. Micron’s Childcare Center is one of the first commitments aligned to the Idaho Community Investment Framework.Story continuesMicron has championed community and workforce development in Idaho for decades. The Idaho Community Investment Framework reflects the company’s long-standing partnership with the State of Idaho and the City of Boise, and will guide Micron’s efforts to cultivate the talent pipeline and enrich the communities where its team members live and work. The Framework will focus on three key elements: building the workforce of the future, investing in STEM education for all and engaging with local communities.“At Micron, we understand our footprint extends well beyond our fabs — it also impacts the broader communities where our employees live,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “The Idaho Community Investment Framework solidifies our deep commitment to building the semiconductor workforce at scale and fortifying the success of domestic memory manufacturing. I’m thankful for the continued leadership from Governor Brad Little, Mayor Lauren McLean and others who are working alongside us to ensure that Micron’s investment in leading-edge memory manufacturing benefits all communities.”Micron’s Childcare Center will support the broader Treasure Valley community, creating additional childcare capacity by serving Micron employees. Micron is focused on growing the talent pipeline while increasing the quality of childcare resources in the region. To further address the needs of its employees and the fab’s construction workforce in Idaho, Micron will partner with IdahoSTARS and other childcare referral tools to identify shared resources that support high-quality, affordable childcare.“I’m proud of Micron’s comprehensive approach to workforce development and our work to make childcare accessible and affordable for our employees,” said Micron Senior Vice President, Chief People Officer and President of the Micron Foundation April Arnzen. “We recognize that there are systemic barriers to workforce entry and re-entry, including childcare services, which is why we are focused on providing childcare options that support and expand the workforce, and benefits the broader community.”“Idaho is made stronger when businesses and their employees are supported and we remove barriers to their success,” said Governor Brad Little. “Idaho has made historic investments in education, workforce training, childcare and other infrastructure, and our commitment to Idaho families is complemented by the steps Micron is taking to strengthen our communities and our state.”“I so appreciate Micron's partnership and shared commitment to investing in and caring for people. This new childcare facility will ensure kids are cared for while their parents are seeking economic opportunity and contributing to our vibrant community,” said Mayor Lauren McLean. “Additional community investments, highlighted through the Idaho Community Investment Framework, shows Micron’s commitment to meeting the needs of its employees and strengthening communities.”The groundbreaking of Micron’s Childcare Center and formation of the Community Investment Framework coincides with two new industry sector grants funded by the Idaho Workforce Development Council (IWDC) in support of the Idaho semiconductor workforce. This includes a $5 million grant to Boise State University, which will steward the Semiconductor for All program, an initiative that will support the education ecosystem across the state. IWDC will also provide a $4.2 million grant to the College of Western Idaho for the expansion of their Mechatronics Program, leading efforts in delivering key skills and education to prepare students for careers in the industry.About Micron Technology, Inc.

The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Brown and Brown, Erie Indemnity and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.Increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services.Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside.Story continuesThe operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players.Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and improving retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

The figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.09.PLD’s quarterly results reflected solid demand for industrial real estate, leading to low vacancies and an increase in rents. The industrial REIT also raised the midpoint of its 2023 guidance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price.Healthy Operating Performance: The industrial real estate market is still firing on all cylinders with robust demand, rents and occupancy growth. In addition, the demand for space is escalating, given the growth in industries, an e-commerce boom and companies’ endeavors to improve their supply-chain efficiencies. Prologis’ portfolio of modern and high-quality logistics facilities has benefited from these favorable industrial real estate market fundamentals.The company has witnessed a healthy operating performance, as evident from its solid leasing activity. In the first quarter of 2023, 49.7 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 41.6 msf in the operating portfolio and 8.1 msf in the development portfolio.Moreover, Prologis' average occupancy level in the owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the quarter and the retention level was 77.2%. The cash rent change was 41.9%, representing an all-time high.Acquisitions &amp; Developments: Prologis has been making concerted efforts to enhance its overall portfolio quality with acquisitions and developments in strategic markets. In the first quarter of 2023, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $6 million. Development stabilization aggregated $770 million, while development starts totaled $57 million, with 100% being built to suit.Notably, in October 2022, the company closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, including the assumption of debt, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: The company’s robust balance sheet position has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $5.7 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Mar 31, 2023. It also enjoys credit ratings of A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s, enabling the company to borrow at an advantageous rate.Moreover, PLD’s current cash flow growth is projected at 12.69% compared with the 9.37% expected for the industry. Further, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 5.54% compared with the industry’s average of 3.77%. This reflects that the company has been more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.FFO Growth: Over the past three to five years, Prologis recorded FFO per share growth of 13.55% compared with the industry’s average of 0.16%. Moreover, for 2023, the company revised its core FFO per share guidance to $5.42-$5.50 from $5.40-$5.50 estimated earlier, suggesting a 0.2% increase at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $5.49, suggesting growth of 5.81% for 2023 compared with the industry’s average of 0.53%.Dividends: Solid dividends are a huge attraction for REIT investors, and PLD has remained committed to that. In February 2023, the company’s board hiked its quarterly dividend by 10% to 87 cents per share from 79 cents paid earlier, taking the annualized dividend to $3.48 per share. Also, it has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 12.87%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, the rising supply in several markets is likely to intensify competition and create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters. The stabilization of e-commerce sales growth and a high interest rate environment raise concerns for Prologis.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Iron Mountain IRM, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR and Stag Industrial STAG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Iron Mountain’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share is currently pegged at $3.96, suggesting a year-over year-growth of 4.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rexford Industrial’s current-year FFO per share stands at $2.19 and implies an increase of 11.7% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stag Industrial’s ongoing year’s FFO per share is pegged at $2.25 presently and indicates a year-over-year rise of 1.8%.  Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NetApp makes additional adjustments to the non-GAAP tax provision for certain tax matters as described below. A detailed reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP results can be found at http://investors.netapp.com. NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes that the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance.6GAAP net income per share and non-GAAP net income per share are calculated using the diluted number of shares.NetApp usage of non-GAAP financial informationTo supplement NetApp’s condensed consolidated financial statement information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), NetApp provides investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, free cash flow, billings, and historical and projected non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. NetApp also presents the hardware and software components of our GAAP product revenues. Because our revenue recognition policy under GAAP defines a configured storage system, inclusive of the operating system software essential to its functionality, as a single performance obligation, hardware and software components of our product revenues are considered non-GAAP measures. The hardware and software components of our product revenues are derived from an estimated fair value allocation of the transaction price of our contracts with customers, down to the level of the product hardware and software components. This allocation is primarily based on the contractual prices at which NetApp has historically billed customers for such respective components.NetApp believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP earnings per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.NetApp believes that the presentation of free cash flow, which it defines as the net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment, to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in its business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on its common stock. As free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the analysis provided in the statement of cash flows.NetApp believes that the presentation of the software and hardware components of our product revenues is meaningful to investors and management as it illustrates the significance of the Company’s software and provides improved visibility into the value created by our software innovation and R&amp;D investment.NetApp approximates billings by adding net revenues as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period to the change in total deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue as reported on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the same period. Billings is a performance measure that NetApp believes provides useful information to management and investors because it approximates the amounts under purchase orders received by us during a given period that have been billed.NetApp’s management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApp’s ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors’ operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures when applicable:A. Amortization of intangible assets. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.B. Stock-based compensation expenses. NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the amount can fluctuate based on variables unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period.C. Litigation settlements. NetApp may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements. NetApp excludes these charges and benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.D. Acquisition-related expenses. NetApp excludes acquisition-related expenses, including (a) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges and (b) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are not related to our ongoing business or cost base and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.E. Restructuring charges. These charges consist of restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.F. Asset impairments. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.G. Gains/losses on the sale or derecognition of assets. These are gains/losses from the sale of our properties and other transactions in which we transfer control of assets to a third party. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.H. Gains/losses on the sale of investments in equity securities. These are gains/losses from the sale of our investment in certain equity securities. Typically, such investments are sold as a result of a change in control of the underlying businesses. Management believes that these transactions do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.I. Debt extinguishment costs. NetApp excludes certain non-recurring expenses incurred as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. Management believes such nonrecurring costs do not reflect the results of its underlying, on-going business and, therefore, are less useful for future planning and forecasting.J. Income tax adjustments. NetApp’s non-GAAP tax provision is based upon a projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, statute lapses and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-recurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company’s tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) tax charges or benefits resulting from the integration of intellectual property from acquisitions. Management believes that the use of non-GAAP tax provisions provides a more meaningful measure of the Company’s operational performance.These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. NetApp believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. NetApp management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and projected results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures.Constant CurrencyNetApp presents certain constant currency growth rates or quantifies the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on year-over-year fluctuations, including for net revenues, billings, and earnings. This constant currency information assumes the same foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect for the comparable prior-year period were used in translation of the current period results.About NetAppNetApp is a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company that empowers organizations to lead with data in the age of accelerated digital transformation.

Developments associated with TechnipFMC FTI, Eni E and Petrobras PBR also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures increased 1.4% to close at $72.67 per barrel but natural gas prices plunged 15.6% to end at $2.18 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, the crude price action continued to be positive on the reported progress toward U.S. debt-ceiling resolution and the possibility of another supply cut in the upcoming meeting of oil producers alliance OPEC+.Meanwhile, natural gas was overwhelmed by expectations for comfortable temperatures and, therefore, lighter heating or cooling demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1. One of the world’s largest independent oil and gas producers, ConocoPhillips exercised its rights to acquire the remaining interest in the Surmont oil facility, thereby gaining complete ownership of the Alberta operation. The acquisition involves a $3-billion price tag and $325 million in contingent payments. The transaction, expected to be completed in the second half of 2023, will be funded with cash, and short and medium-term financing or a combination of both.Surmont, located in northeastern Alberta, is the fourth-largest oil-sand well site in Canada. The facility produced about 135,000 barrels of oil per day in April. Oil is produced at Surmont by injecting steam into underground wells to push the region’s heavy bitumen to the surface.Gaining control of Surmont’s low-cost production will help ConocoPhillips reach its goal of returning $11 billion in cash to shareholders this year. The acquisition will add about $600 million of free cash flow per year in 2024. It will provide diversity to ConocoPhillips’ portfolio, which is mainly focused on U.S. shale right now. (ConocoPhillips to Buy Remaining Stake in Surmont Facility)2.Shell’s shareholders supported CEO Wael Sawan and the board at the company's annual general meeting in London, despite disruption by climate activists. A few protesters barged onto the platform where Shell's board members were seated, prompting numerous security personnel to step in and remove them.While numerous climate activists demanded an immediate stop to fossil fuel production, the European energy behemoth was backed by shareholders’ vote to set carbon emission reduction objectives for 2030. The company was also supported by big pension funds and investors.In his first annual meeting as Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, defended the business against claims that it was not transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy quickly enough. According to Sawan, SHEL invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy in 2022, including renewable energy, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging stations and biofuels. (Shell Shareholders Support Board at AGM Despite Protests)3. TechnipFMC, a renowned engineering and construction company, clinched a significant integrated Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation (“iEPCI”) contract from Shell plc for the Dover development in the Gulf of Mexico. This contract showcases TechnipFMC's expertise and capabilities in subsea engineering and construction, thereby strengthening its position as a key player in the industry.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which had previously collaborated with Shell on the Appomattox platform, has been entrusted with the task of providing and installing subsea production systems for the Dover development. This project is an important initiative by Shell to enhance its operations in the Gulf of Mexico.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.FTI has several responsibilities in the aforementioned project. First, the company will supply the subsea tree systems required for the development. These systems play a vital role in the efficient extraction of hydrocarbons from underwater reservoirs. (TechnipFMC Wins iEPCI Contract for Dover Development)4   Rome-based energy biggie Eni’s CEO Claudio Descalzi signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sonangol to expand the scope of understanding between the two companies. They plan to do so by conducting research on the agribusiness value chain and other decarbonization matters, such as energy transition minerals and innovation ecosystem.Per the terms of the MoU, Eni and Sonangol will work in tandem to identify and assess opportunities in the energy transition field. Their efforts will include the assessment of agro-industrial supply chains for the generation of low-carbon fuels, valorization of residual biomass and the use of green ammonia for agro-industrial applications.The companies will also evaluate agribusiness potential, including research to support synergies across national agricultural food and bioenergy value chains. They will do so with an eye on improved seeds and biotechnologies, mechanization, fertilizers and logistics services. (Eni Signs MoU With Sonangol for Decarbonization Efforts)5.   Petrobras, the renowned Brazilian oil company, recently announced its intention to file a request with Brazil's environmental protection agency, IBAMA, seeking a reconsideration of its denial of the environmental license for drilling an exploratory well in block FZA-M-059. This block is located in the deep waters of Amapá, offshore Brazil. The decision followed IBAMA's assessment, which highlighted a range of technical inconsistencies and recommendations from analysts on the Environmental Licensing Board.In a report issued by Ibama, several concerns were raised regarding Petrobras' request. It pointed out discrepancies in environmental studies, inadequate measures for communicating with indigenous communities and deficiencies in PBR's plan to safeguard the region's wildlife.

OXY invested $4.5 billion in 2022 and is expected to invest $5.4-$6.2 billion in 2023. Its persistent focus on Permian resources has been beneficial for the company.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boston Scientific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.074 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$33b - US$4.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.4%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 8.9% average generated by the Medical Equipment industry. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceIn the above chart we have measured Boston Scientific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Boston Scientific's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Boston Scientific doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 7.4% from 12% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesOn a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.The Bottom LineTo conclude, we've found that Boston Scientific is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 67% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Boston Scientific does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which can't be ignored)  we think you should know about.While Boston Scientific may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

BSX appears in good shape, with its shares rallying 26.4% in the past year. The company is gaining from strong improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business. The raised 2023 guidance increases investors’ confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed its industry’s decline of 31.2% in the past year.What’s Aiding Boston Scientific?Q1 Upsides: Boston Scientific ended the first quarter of 2023, with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. Organic revenues at each of its core business segments and geographies were up in the reported quarter.Geographically, The United States registered an increase of 13% year over year operationally, inclusive of a 140 basis-point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable organic strength across each business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) registered a rise of 20% on an operational basis, with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. The  above-market growth is driven by Boston Scientific’s diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.Impressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, will likely boost the top line in the long term.In April 2023, Boston Scientific closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition, which furthers the company’s category leadership strategy within the growing area of endoluminal surgery with differentiated technologies like OverStitch and xTAC along with an entry into the adjacent endobariatric market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn February 2023, the company closed its majority stake investment in Acotec (a local Chinese company and prominent name in the field of drug-coated balloons in the region and many other peripheral and potentially cardiology procedures), further expanding its presence in China and continues to expect double-digit growth for the full year.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum banking on strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. the next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.In the first quarter, Boston Scientific noted that, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 29% year over year. 2. In the first quarter, demand remained robust for WATCHMAN FLX and by the time of the earnings release, the company treated more than 300,000 patients globally since launch.

359,c5d886a6-ce06-3c92-9169-c40ec07d624d,ULTA,2023-06-01,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-trending-130006403.html,1685538006,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -22.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, to which Ulta belongs, has lost 13.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Ulta is expected to post earnings of $5.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $25.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.5%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.91 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Ulta.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Ulta, the consensus sales estimate of $2.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.4%. The $11.07 billion and $11.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.5% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $6.88 for the same period compares with $6.30 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +0.88%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Canadian National Railway Co. CNI, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC and CSX Corp. CSX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Are Railroad Companies Becoming More Employee Friendly?The Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being weighed down by challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel prices and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 4% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.7% appreciation and 2.4% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, it has been an encouraging move on railroad companies’ part to take care of employees’ needs by entering into collective deals with the unions. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co., Union Pacific Corp., Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. have tried to address their employees’ requirements through multiple initiatives such as by increasing their paid sick leaves, offering them better working schedules to ensure a balanced personal and professional life and improving working conditions.Each of the abovementioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Canadian National recently announced that its collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) has been ratified. The union represents almost 6,000 Canadian National locomotive engineers, conductors, yard conductors and yard coordinators working in Canada.Story continuesTracy Robinson, president and chief executive officer of CNI, stated, “We are pleased that TCRC members have ratified the collective agreement reached earlier this year. We thank the TCRC leadership for their engagement throughout this process.  We remain committed to working with this important group to ensure continued service for our customers and improved working conditions for our team members.""Union Pacific has entered into a tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The deal is aimed at improving the quality of life for Union Pacific’s locomotive engineers and their families by offering them better working schedules.UNP employs nearly 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET. The tentative deal offers locomotive engineers 11 days on and four days off schedule. This deal should help UNP progress productively with its employees with the new work/rest schedules.Norfolk Southern has entered into an agreement with BLET, aimed at offering up to seven paid sick days per year to BLET members. This deal will offer five new days of paid sick leave per year to Norfolk Southern engineers. Further, it will also provide them the flexibility to use up to two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.The deal covers more than 3,300 Norfolk Southern engineers, representing almost 25% of the NS craft workforce. With this agreement, almost all the company's craft employees — approximately 98% — have entered into paid sick leave deals.CSX announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division CSRA (SMART-TD CSRA), aimed at offering paid sick leave benefits. This deal (which is pending ratification by union members) is the 10th one between CSX and its union-represented employees since February. Most of CSX’s unionized workers now have paid sick leave benefits.SMART-TD CSRA represents trainmen, conductors and yardmen on territories of CSX’s Atlanta and West Point railroad, Winston-Salem Southbound railway, Louisville and Nashville railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad.Such agreements reflect the employee-friendly attitude of the railroad companies through which they try to maintain cordial relations with employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere. These efforts should also help the companies retain and recruit more employees.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

""A lot of these measures go by the collective name of precision scheduled railroading, although I have never seen a completely satisfactory definition of the things that go into that. Bottom line, there needs to be a level of safety and accountability.""Longtime railroad exec Hunter Harrison pioneered precision scheduled railroading (PSR) as a means to cut costs and prop up operating margins. The system has three key components: minimize railroad car downtime, run longer trains at higher speeds, and minimize power requirements.Critics of PSR contend the process has been an exercise in cutting employees and running less-safe railroads to maximize the bottom line.A recent ProPublica analysis of Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) data found that 20 train derailments from 2005 to 2020 could be linked to trains being too long, for instance.There have been 41 freight train derailments alone in 2023 according to data from Mira Safety, although it's unclear if PSR is to directly blame for any of them.Nonetheless, the PSR model has come into focus amid several Norfolk Southern derailments this year.On Feb. 3, a Norfolk Southern train with 150 cars carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. The NTSB found the operators of the train tried to stop it after a wheel bearing overheated to a worrying level. An official cause of the derailment has not yet been shared by the NTSB.The company incurred a $387 million charge in the first quarter related to potential clean-up efforts from the Feb. 3 derailment.Then in early May, nine cars from a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in Pennsylvania.Norfolk Southern CEO told Yahoo Finance Live his railroad is safe, and it will not fully jettison PSR.Story continues""There are some components of PSR that we're going to continue to endorse, and that's developing our people, working safely, investing in our assets,"" Shaw said.He later added: ""Last year at Norfolk Southern, our number of derailments was the lowest in two decades. We can do better. We're looking at this stuff. We're working very closely with the NTSB.""Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tours the site of the Feb. 3, Norfolk Southern train derailment, Thursday, Feb. 23, 2023, in East Palestine, Ohio. (Allie Vugrincic/The Vindicator via AP, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Buttigieg is proposing tougher oversight of the railroads in the wake of Norfolk's stumbles.The FRA has released plans to prioritize inspections of train routes where hazardous materials are carried. Two-person crews would also have to be the standard inside the train.""This is basic, basic common sense [to have two-person crews],"" Buttigieg said. ""But believe it or not, railroads have continued to push to be able to have just one person, even on a train that could be two, three, or four miles long. We are pushing the railroad companies to do the right thing.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Tips on the banking crisis?

364,7674423b-7ab0-3c0d-9d4b-5d65c7895acd,KO,2023-06-01,Calculating The Fair Value Of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-coca-cola-120014467.html,1685620814,STORY,['KO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Coca-Cola is US$63.90 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$59.66 suggests Coca-Cola is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for KO is US$69.47, which is 8.7% above our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.31bUS$11.5bUS$12.4bUS$14.1bUS$14.5bUS$14.9bUS$15.2bUS$15.6bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.29%Est @ 2.23%Est @ 2.20% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$8.7kUS$10.1kUS$10.2kUS$10.8kUS$10.4kUS$10.0kUS$9.6kUS$9.2kUS$8.8kUS$8.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$96bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$350bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$350b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$180bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$276b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$59.7, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Coca-Cola, we've compiled three important factors you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the statistics of plastic pollution, steps taken by the international community to counter it, companies working to promote bioplastics and problems faced by the U.S. states that banned plastic bags and go directly to 5 States that Banned Plastic Bags.Plastic bags were born in the post-World War 2 explosion of manufactured plastic household goods and became popular in the 70’s. By the end of 1980’s, grocery stores across the U.S. had switched from paper to plastic and these single-use plastic bags have grown rapidly since then. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, single-use plastic bags are statistically one of the leading causes of pollution in the world. A plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to decompose and as it breaks down, it makes its way into our water systems, where fish and other marine life consume it, contaminating our food sources with microplastics. Plastic bags are also very difficult to recycle and around 93 billion plastic bags don’t get recycled each year. In 2018, less than 9% of all used plastic bags were recycled. These bags cause a tremendous amount of pollution also during their synthesis, and a total of 300 million tons of toxic plastic waste is produced every year just in the manufacturing of plastic bags. To combat this menace, at least 127 countries have introduced some form of legislation to regulate plastic bags, as of July 2018, according to a report by the UN Environment Programme. These policies range from outright bans, such as in Marshall Islands, to progressive phase-outs, like in Uzbekistan and Moldova, to laws in Romania and Vietnam that incentivize the use of reusable bags. Even an Al-Qaeda-backed terrorist group joined in banning plastic bags in 2018 as ‘a serious threat to the well-being of humans and animals alike’. The European Union has also taken steps to curb the use of plastic bags and other plastic items found most commonly at European beaches. The European Parliament passed a law in 2019, according to which single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers, cotton buds and polystyrene food containers would be banned by 2021. Member states would also have to achieve a 90% collection target for plastic bottles by 2029 and these bottles would have to contain at least 25% of recycled content by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Story continuesHowever, the World Resources Institute has reported that several loopholes exist in the worldwide implementation of laws regulating single-use plastic bags. Most countries fail to regulate plastic throughout its entire life-cycle, for example, China bans the import of plastic bags and mandates that retailers charge consumers for them, but does not explicitly restrict their production and exports. Some countries prefer to impose partial bans instead of full bans. Partial bans may include requirements on bags’ thickness and composition. Also, virtually no country restricts plastic bag manufacturing itself, with the exception of Cape Verde, where only biodegradable and compost plastic bags are allowed to be manufactured. A solution to this problem could also be the use of bioplastics, which are plastic materials produced from renewable biomass sources, such as vegetables fats and oils, recycled food waste etc. Several companies have made huge progress in the bioplastic industry and one of them is Danimer Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:DNMR). The company produces bio-based plastics using microorganisms and so Danimer Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:DNMR) owns 150 patents in nearly 20 countries. The Nodax plastic produced by Danimer Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:DNMR) is 100% renewable and biodegradable. Another notable player in this industry is the Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN). Once a subsidiary of the Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE:KODK), today Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) is an independent company making significant progress in the bioplastic and recycling industry. The bioplastics made by Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) have made it into mobile cases, eye-wear, headphones, textiles and power tools etc. Another company making progress in reducing plastic waste is The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), which in fact, is also one of the worst plastic polluters in the world. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) pumps out 200,000 bottles a minute, an equivalent of 3 million tons of plastic packaging every year. To help control this situation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) launched its World Without Waste initiative in 2018, which centers around 3 primary goals, making 100% of their packaging recyclable and using more recyclable material by 2030, collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one they sell by 2030 and lastly, to partner up with other organizations to support a healthy, debris-free environment. If you want to read more about other companies making an impact by curbing pollution around the world, please refer to our articles 20 Most Important Companies in the World and 10 Biggest Issues in the World and the Companies Working on Solving Them. The global bioplastics market size was estimated at $11.61 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 18.8% from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research.A recent study by Rebecca Taylor, an economist at the University of Sydney, has revealed that the state of California’s bag ban led to a moderate increase in paper bag usage and pushed other customers to buy thicker plastic bags. Due to the increased weight of these thicker bags, the study reported that 28.5% of plastic reduced due to the bag ban was offset by shifting consumption to other bags. State legislations regarding bag bans have often defined prohibited bags by their thickness or applied measurements requiring that they carry a certain weight a certain distance. So what has happened is that bag makers have flooded markets with thicker plastic bags, often imported from China. This is the reason why the plastic-ban law in Vermont has opted for requiring stitched handles. Because of the cost of stitched handles, it effectively ensures that carryout bags will be made from cloth or reusable polypropylene, encouraging reuse. 10 States that Banned Plastic BagsPhoto by Nick Fewings on UnsplashMethodology:The United States of America is one of the largest generators of plastic packaging waste in the world. Americans use an estimated 100 billion plastic bags per year, which require 12 million barrels of fuel to manufacture. This means that the annual per capita consumption of plastic bags in the country is around 365 per year, or one plastic bag per person daily. In comparison, Denmark, which introduced the first bag-tax in the world in 1993, has a per capita consumption of four plastic bags per year. Several states in the U.S. have introduced legislation that banned single-use plastic bags. While some states are focusing on implementing effective recycling programs, others are imposing bans or fees to discourage the use of plastic bags altogether. In addition, nearly 100 towns, cities and counties across the U.S. have also enacted laws at the local level to curb the use of single-use plastic bags. To collect data for this article, we have referred to the National Conference for State Legislatures or the respective state websites.Here is the list of the states that have banned plastic bags:10. New YorkThe state of New York, where an estimated 23 billion plastic bags were used each year, introduced a new Bag Waste Reduction Law, which took effect on the 1st of March 2020. According to the law, all plastic carryout bags (except bags that are exempt) were banned from distribution by anyone required to collect New York State sales tax. For sales that are tax exempt, plastic carryout bags are still not allowed to be distributed by anyone required to collect the state sales tax. Cities and counties have also been involved. In order to promote reusable bags, cities and counties have been authorized to adopt a 5-cent paper carryout reduction fee, with 2 cents going to local governments and 3 cents going to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund. Stores covered under the act are still required to collect plastic bags and other film plastics from consumers for recycling. Some plastic bags are exempt under the law, such as bags used by a pharmacy to carry prescription drugs and produce bags for bulk items, such as fruits and vegetables.  New York became the third state that banned plastic bags in the country. 9. ConnecticutIn August 2019, the state of Connecticut enacted a law to collect a 10-cent fee on single-use plastic bags. Despite the three-month suspension on the fee, during the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant change was seen in consumer behavior regarding the use of plastic bags. According to the president of the Connecticut Food Association, over 500 million bags had been eliminated in traditional retail grocery stores since the law’s inception. Before the fee, only 1 in 10 shoppers brought their own bag to the store, which changed to 8 out of 10, after the law was implemented. In 2020, 44.3 million bags were still sold at checkout and at 10 cents a piece, which cost the consumers $4.43 million, generating decent revenue. Starting July 1st 2021, the use of single-use plastic bags was banned altogether in Connecticut.8. DelawareDelaware state enacted a law in 2009 (amended in 2014) encouraging the use of reusable bags by consumers and retailers. It required a store to establish an at-store recycling program that provided an opportunity for customers to return plastic bags and required all carryout bags to display a recycling message. In 2019, the state assembly enacted a law banning plastic carryout bags altogether, to help reduce beach and roadside litter and increase recycling efforts. There were a few exceptions to the ban, including the plastic bags used within grocery stores to cover meat or to carry bulk items, such as fruits and vegetables. 7. Maine The state assembly of Maine enacted a law as early as 1991, stating that retailers may only provide plastic bags to customers if there is a receptacle to collect used plastic bags within 20 feet of the entrance and all plastic bags collected are then recycled. In 2019, another law was introduced that banned retailers from providing single-use carryout bags to their customers altogether, with few exemptions for certain types and uses of plastic and paper bags. According to the ban, grocery stores, box stores and large retailers that provide carryout bags to their customers must collect a 5-cent fee for each bag, with the exception of reusable bags not made of plastic or cloth bags with stitched handles. The law was implemented on July 1st 2021 and so Maine became the 4th state in the country that banned plastic bags in America. 6. Vermont Vermont enacted a law to adopt the most comprehensive plastics ban in the U.S. The new law, which took effect in July 2020, prohibited retailers and restaurants from providing customers with not only single-use carryout bags, but also plastic straws, drink stirrers and polystyrene food packaging. The bag ban applies only to bags sold at point-of-sales and not to bags sold as household trash bags or bags used in grocery stores to carry bulk items. Retailers and restaurants are also required to collect a 10-cent fee for paper bags, but small paper bags are exempt from this charge. Click to continue reading and see the 5 States that Banned Plastic Bags. Suggested Articles:15 Largest Plastic Manufacturing Companies in the World15 Countries that Produce the Most Plastic Waste30 Most Polluted Cities in the U.S.Disclosure: None. 10 States that Banned Plastic Bags is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP) share price is up 79% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 45% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 22% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 12% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Coca-Cola Europacific Partners will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' TSR for the last 5 years was 106%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 22% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 16%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola Europacific Partners better, we need to consider many other factors.

Soft Drink and Beverage companies have demonstrated that they can be some of the highest performing stocks in the market.While Coca-Cola KO and Pepsi PEP have shaped the industry for decades, several newer companies have proven that there is plenty of room for beverage innovation.Monster Beverage MNST, Celsius CELH, and Vita Coco COCO are all high-ranking stocks that have put up some incredible returns. COCO, the newest company, went public just 18 months ago and is already up 92% since its IPO.However, the returns of Celsius, and Monster Beverage are in a league of their own. Over the last 10 years CELH stock is up a mind boggling 51,800%, or 85% annualized. Over the last 20 years MNST stock is up an unbelievable 128,500%, or 42.5% annualized.The fresh new offerings from these companies haven’t gone unnoticed by the industry’s incumbents. In 2015, Coca Cola acquired a 16.7% equity stake in Monster Beverage and placed two directors on its board. Additionally, KO transferred its energy drink business to MNST, and MNST transferred its non-energy drink business to KO. The partnership has likely been beneficial to both companies.The beverage industry more broadly has been experiencing strong returns over the last year as well. It currently ranks in the top 10% of the Zacks Industry Rank, and has outperformed the market Indexes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCelsiusCelsius is an innovative beverage company that has gained significant attention for its unique line of fitness drinks. Focused on providing functional and healthy beverages, Celsius has positioned itself as a leader in the growing wellness industry.The company's flagship product, Celsius Fitness Drink, stands out for its thermogenic properties and ability to enhance metabolism and energy levels. With a commitment to science-backed formulations and quality ingredients, CELH has built a loyal customer base among fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers.Story continuesThe brand's success can be attributed to its targeted marketing strategies, extensive distribution network, and strategic partnerships with athletes and fitness influencers.CELH has seen its earnings estimates revised significantly higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 14.8% are expected to grow 158% YoY and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 32.7% and are expected to grow 154% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales over the last decade at CELH have gone absolutely parabolic. In just the last four years revenue has 10x’d from $75 million to $780 million. That pace looks like it is going to keep up, as the current quarter sales are projected to grow 75% YoY and FY23 sales are expected to climb 68% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCelsius has an admittedly lofty valuation. Trading at a TTM price to sales ratio of 13.8x it is well above the industry average of 4.9x, and its 10-year median of 5.7x. It is worth noting that MNST is trading at a 9.4x multiple, which is high compared to any standard. However, its 10-year median is 8.8x, so it is just about in line with its historical average.This shows just how high the market is willing value these successful beverage companies. While CELH may not be the next MNST, it likely has a few more years of exponential revenue growth, making the sky-high valuation a bit more palatable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVita CocoVita Coco is a leading beverage company that has made a significant impact in the coconut water market. Recognizing the growing demand for natural and healthier hydration options, Vita Coco has successfully established itself as a trusted brand offering premium coconut water products.COCO sources its coconuts from carefully selected regions to ensure the highest quality and taste. Vita Coco's beverages are known for their refreshing flavor, natural electrolytes, and hydrating properties, making them a popular choice among fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers.With a strong commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing practices, Vita Coco has not only captured a significant market share but also earned a reputation as a socially responsible brand. As the demand for healthier beverages continues to rise, COCO is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and maintain its position as a leading player in the coconut water market.Vita Coco currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by nearly 5% and are expected to see growth of 191% YoY. Additionally, FY23 sales are projected to grow 11.7% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCOCO is trading at a TTM price to sales ratio of 3.4x, which is well below the industry average of 4.9x, and above its two-year median of 1.8x. Considering how rapidly the drink has become one of the most popular coconut water drinks in the market this may be a compelling valuation, especially when compared to MNST and CELH.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonster BeverageMonster Beverage is a powerhouse in the global beverage industry, known for its iconic energy drink brand. With a strong presence in over 90 countries, MNST has cemented its position as a market leader. The company's flagship product, Monster Energy, has gained widespread popularity for its bold flavors, potent caffeine content, and association with extreme sports and lifestyle.Leveraging a successful marketing strategy that targets a youthful demographic, Monster Beverage has effectively built a strong brand image and cultivated a dedicated following. Despite facing fierce competition in the energy drink space, Monster Beverage's relentless commitment to product innovation, strategic partnerships, and expanding product portfolio continues to drive its growth and reinforce its position as a dominant player in the ever-energetic beverage market.MNST boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting its upward trending earnings revisions. FY23 earnings have been revised higher by 9.2% and are expected to grow 38.4% YoY, an incredible growth rate for a mature company. Additionally, FY23 sales are expected to grow 12.5% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlmost as impressive as its stock returns are the growth in earnings per share. From 2004 to 2022 EPS have grown from $0.02 to $1.22, which is a CAGR of 23%. Also interesting is that net income has been ~20% revenue almost every single year, showing incredibly stability of the company’s financial management.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMNST offers an insight into what a powerful return on equity looks like. Monster Beverage has $8.8 billion in total assets, and just $1.5 billion in liabilities, leaving shareholder equity at ~$7.4 billion. With that equity it produces $1.3 billion in net income, an 18% return on equity, which MNST will likely be able to produce for decades to come. That is an enviable position for any company.Bottom LineBeverage companies enjoy strong fundamental factors when the business is executed properly. Drinks are easily and regularly consumed, sometimes multiple times per day. Especially when brands get into something like the health niche, consumers can identify with brand making customers consumption even stickier. Additionally, there are massive, readily available networks for drinks to be distributed, from supermarkets to convenience stores and direct to consumers among others. Lastly, beverages have great margins, allowing them the potential to be extremely profitable.Investors have a few options when it comes to investing in drink companies; buy shares in the leaders like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, who often absorb smaller and fast-growing start-up brands. Buy shares in the newcomers like those listed above or find an even newer brand that fits into some trending niche with high risk, but high reward potential. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Waste Management The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.56bUS$2.40bUS$3.02bUS$3.45bUS$3.68bUS$3.86bUS$4.02bUS$4.16bUS$4.29bUS$4.41bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.47%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$1.4kUS$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$35bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$57b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$162, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.992. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

However, Intuit's CEO is not a fan. In interview with Yahoo Finance Live, Sasan Goodarzi says there are already free e-filing programs available to taxpayers and that he thinks a new one from the government is not ""a great use of taxpayer money."" Goodarzi is more positive on AI however, saying that next to electricity and the internet, ""AI is the biggest platform that will ignite innovation across every single industry."" He highlighted Intuit's Mailchimp, which recently launched an email content generator which uses generative AI.Video Transcript- Intuit the parent company of brands like TurboTax and Credit Karma sheds light on financial needs for consumers and small businesses. From economic uncertainty to potential cuts in funds for the IRS, there's quite a bit at play for the financial tech platform.Here to discuss this and more is Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi along with our Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. So, Sasan, let's start with this. Let's start with the debt ceiling deal that's going to be voted on today. What does that signal for your business?SASAN GOODARZI: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. Great to see the both of you. Well, we're just happy for the country, because we don't want the country to go into default. In terms of impact to our business, I think it doesn't have any impact other than it's important for the United States not to go into default. And we think that's a really good thing. And we're happy that there's a deal being cut, and we can move on as a nation.BRIAN SOZZI: Sasan, Brian here. Good to see you as always, I think. you know, I read like eight notes before we report earnings a couple weeks-- a couple, I believe, last week on how this free e-file system that the government may stand up may impact your business. But, I mean, come on, can the government get a website right?[LAUGHS]SASAN GOODARZI: It's good to see you, Brian. You know, our perspective has been consistent in the last 10 plus years. First and foremost, free software already exists for all Americans. And this will yet be another free tax software. We don't think it's a great use of taxpayer money given the existence of free tax software. And so it's really not an event for us as a business. It's not material at all for us.Story continuesAnd I'll just remind us that in the last several years, there's been two huge entrants into the space. One, before we acquired Credit Karma which has well over 120 million members, they chose to get into the tax business, and they really had very little impact. And they were all free. And then the company that we sold, the Credit Karma tax too, once we acquired Credit Karma also provides free tax software, and it's not had a huge impact. So the point is free software already exists. For the government to create yet another free software does not make an impact to our business.- So I got to ask you. One of the big buzzwords that we've talked about a lot lately and in recent months is AI. Some companies are all in on AI. Just about every company talks about how they're incorporating it in their business, including companies that you wouldn't even think of like the Pepsi. So where do you all stand? Are you all in? Or there is also the camp that is kind of warning about the dangers of AI, where do you all stand as a company on AI and how you'll be using it in your business?SASAN GOODARZI: Yeah, first of all, you know, I've been on the record. It's been almost been five years ago that I believe and we believe as a company that next to electricity and the internet, AI is the biggest platform that will ignite innovation across every single industry. And particularly with generative AI, we believe that it will create new companies. Existing companies can get disrupted. And depending on how you choose to leverage it, it's an enormous opportunity.And I think the opportunity first starts with data. And when I think about Intuit and what we are focused on for our customers-- You know, we have a 360 view of our customers. And I'll just use a small business as an example. You know, small business of, you know, 10 people, they have to do a lot of work to figure out how to manage their customers, how to get new customers, how to sell more services to the customers that they have, knowing which ones are profitable customers, which products are profitable, and then being able to manage their cash flow.And the power of AI is with all of the data that we have-- we see all the money coming in, all the money going out, and all the transactional data, we have customer data and purchasing data-- we're actually able to automate what a small business needs to do today by helping put marketing campaigns together for them that they can edit, confirm, and have it run, and have it-- help them understand how did that campaign produce results, where is there an opportunity to produce better results to be able to understand how to manage their cash flow, to get access to capital when needed.And with data and with AI, you really have the opportunity to be the platform that fuels the success of small businesses, and the same thing holds true for consumers. So we are huge believers of AI particularly knowledge engineering, machine learning, and now generative AI. And I don't think it's hype.Now there are dangers with any technology that you have to be thoughtful about, you have to have governance around, you have to have standards around. But this is the real deal, and I think that it will deliver benefits in ways for customers that we could never imagine possible, and it's very exciting from our perspective.BRIAN SOZZI: Sasan, out of your two marquee businesses-- let's stay with Mailchimp and TurboTax-- where will AI play the biggest role, and how do you monetize that?SASAN GOODARZI: Well, I'll start with Mailchimp. With Mailchimp, one of the things we recently launched is email content generated that's all fueled by data, machine learning, and generative AI. What that means is we, in essence, will generate the content for a customer to be able to market to their customers.I'll stick with email for a moment. We'll propose to them a title that we know works very, very well from behavioral and longitudinal data that we have across millions of small businesses. Plus based on what services they want to sell, we'll pull together what the actual campaign will look like, and all they have to do is edit it, review it. It's all done for them proactively.And to ensure that they're comfortable with it, they hit send. And not only do we now auto-generate it, but we can come back to the customer and help them understand how many people viewed it, how many people actually made a purchase-- those that didn't make a purchase, who are they, what services do they have-- to give them segment reporting that then they can generate, and we can generate for them automatically the next sort of generation of marketing. So that's a very specific example for Mailchimp.Let me go to TurboTax, and then I'll answer your question about the monetization. One of the elements of our investments that started five years ago in context of AI was what we call knowledge engineering. And knowledge engineering, in essence, turns rules and the relationship between all the data that we have and the specific data that we have for the customer into code and into recommendations and so a lot of the way we produce our code across the TurboTax platform, the questions we choose to ask customers, the areas where we choose not to engage the customer. And then when we bring an expert to engage the customer, it can be a bot, it can be a human being, and all of that is driven by AI.And in fact, two years ago, we had a generative AI launch where when an expert is engaging a customer, the entire conversation, the call summary, everything is captured. And the expert doesn't have to do that work, it's captured in the system. They can also cut and paste what they need and follow up with the customer.That is all based on knowledge engineering, machine learning, and now generative AI capabilities. And it really drives automation. And the biggest opportunity for us is to disrupt the assisted segment. It's labor intensive, it's a lot of manual work, a lot of documentation capture. With our investments in AI, it's going to help us accelerate the disruption of those that need help to do it digitally anywhere that they wish.To your question around monetization, and I'll end with this. You know, we often talk about the fact that we have a $300 billion total addressable market and our penetration is 5%. And although our company has been growing double digits, it's what excites us about the next 10 years.Now why is penetration so hard? You're dealing with people's money, right? You're trying to help a small business grow their customers, manage their cash flow. You're trying to help a consumer save money, get out of debt, get their taxes done. And when it comes to money, people are fearful of are they doing it right? Are they confident in their decisions?And for us, all of our AI investments over the last five plus years and now our acceleration with generative AI actually helps us make things more personalized, more humanized, more engaging. That therefore allows us to penetrate at a accelerated rate which results in growth for the company.So we see it as a disruption to accelerate penetration and to disrupt the mid-market and the upmarket that we're focused on serving. We don't see it as we'll monetize generative AI only and some customers don't get it. We see it as a fuel for our entire platform.- All right. Well, we will have to leave it there for today. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and Yahoo Finance's own Brian Sozzi, our thanks to both of you.]"

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, published its first annual Supplier Diversity Economic Impact Report. Through a concerted effort to proactively source products and services from small and diverse suppliers, Intuit is achieving impactful change for minority and women-owned businesses at scale.During Intuit’s fiscal year 2022, the company spent $312 million with 550 US-based diverse and small businesses, an increase of $24 million year-over-year. Intuit’s focus on creating new opportunities for diverse small businesses is aimed at reducing economic disparities in underserved communities in the US by supporting new jobs and opportunities for small businesses to scale and grow their businesses in communities in which they operate.""We are proud to highlight that for every $1 we spend with diverse small businesses, we create $1.96 of economic impact,"" said Emma Chontos, Chief Procurement Officer at Intuit. ""Our supplier diversity program is far more than just a business strategy, it’s an opportunity to drive meaningful change in local communities and is a key component of our mission to power prosperity.""Intuit’s spending with diverse and small business suppliers generates economic activity in its supply chain and communities. In total, the program generated $613 million in total production. Key findings also included that the program supported more than 4,000 jobs across Intuit’s supply chain and in the communities in which they operate, generating $261 million in total wages to the economy. A subset of these jobs are also included in Intuit’s Prosperity Hub Program.Story continuesView Intuit’s complete Supplier DEI Economic Impact Report here.Intuit’s Supplier DEI and Social Impact Program is committed to improving small business cash flow by accelerating payments to be due upon receipt of invoices for small and diverse suppliers that are minority-owned (Asian-Indian, Asian-Pacific, Black, Hispanic, or Native American), LGBTQ+ owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, or disability-owned.""I run a small boutique firm, and in lean times these expedited payment terms make a huge difference in the success of my business,"" said Tyler Munson, owner of Munson Design. ""In past years, I’ve had some clients go from net 30 to net 45, which can be particularly painful when the upfront costs are large.""At a time when most companies are extending payment terms, through this initiative, Intuit is building on our commitment to small businesses by paying small and diverse suppliers in under 10 days. In fact earlier this month, Intuit joined the US Chamber of Commerce’s newly launched Prompt Pay Pledge, continuing to reinforce its commitment to paying small business suppliers quicker to help America’s small businesses manage their capital and maintain a healthy cash flow.""Through serving our customers, we have seen first-hand how cash flow and access to capital struggles can impact suppliers,"" said Chontos. ""We firmly believe that empowering people with financial security is key to our mission, which has inspired us to be at the forefront in championing early pay options from large corporations to support diverse and small business cash flow.""In fiscal year 2022, Intuit made substantial progress in our Supplier DEI and Social Impact program. Our strategies focused on three impactful areas:- Proactively sourcing products and services from small and diverse businesses to transform Intuit’s supply chain- Investing in and opening doors for small businesses to grow their opportunities with Intuit and industry partners- Collaborating with our suppliers to prioritize DEI within their own workforce and supply chain to achieve impactful change at scaleTo learn more about Intuit’s Supplier DEI &amp; Sustainability Program, visit our Supplier Diversity and Sustainability page.About IntuitIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

Shares have lost about 7.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Stryker due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Stryker reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.14, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00 by 7%. The bottom line also improved 8.6% year over year.GAAP EPS was $1.54, up 83.3% from that recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenue DetailsReported revenues were $4.8 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 billion by 5%. The top line improved 11.8% on a year-over-year basis and 14% at constant currency (cc). Sales were up 13.6% organically, indicating 12.9% growth in unit volume and 0.7% due to higher prices.Revenues by GeographyRevenues in the United States were $3.51 billion, up 13.1% year over year. International sales increased 8.2% to $1.27 billion. International sales were up 16.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency. Strong growth in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan drove International sales during the quarter.Segmental AnalysisMedSurg and Neurotechnology: This segment reported sales of $2.69 billion, up 11% year over year and 13.1% at cc. Double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business as well as Endoscopy and Medical businesses primarily drove sales. Strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan also boosted revenues. Per management, the segment witnessed 12.4% organic growth in the reported quarter.Orthopedics and Spine: Sales in the segment amounted to $2.09 billion, up 12.7% year over year and 15.1% at cc. The top line increased 15.2% organically. This upside can be attributed to continued procedural growth, strong uptake of the Insignia Hip Stem and the recent launch of Q Guidance Navigation System. Strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets also boosted International sales during the quarter.Story continuesMarginsAdjusted gross profit totaled $3.02 billion in the reported quarter, up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) indicates a rise of 5.9% and 26.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s levels.Factors Favoring VMCVulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state and local governments for the construction of highways, bridges, airports, dams, roads and other infrastructure construction.During first-quarter 2023, the company noted that highway starts were more than $100 billion. Other infrastructure starts rose 23% in the trailing 12 months. In Texas, public sector lettings are expected to be almost $8 billion, an all-time high, in the first half of 2023. The company expects the current strength in private non-residential construction activity and increased public funding to offset residential market woes in the remainder of 2023.VMC remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — that enhance price growth and operating efficiencies. Higher price realizations and its four strategic initiatives should continue to increase unit profitability.The improvement in pricing, fixed cost leverage and operating efficiencies helped the company achieve 28% growth in unit profitability of the Aggregates segment and 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in first-quarter 2023. In the trailing 12 months period, adjusted EBITDA rose 11.2% despite persisting inflationary pressure.Also, Vulcan have been following a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up various bolt-on acquisitions that contributed significantly to its growth. Big or small acquisitions have been a key strategy for the company. In 2022, the company acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia, eight aggregates, four asphalt mix and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in California, and an aggregates operation serving limited markets along the Gulf Coast in Honduras for $594.6 million. In 2023, Vulcan expects to spend between $600 and $650 million on capital expenditures.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksVMC currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

390,b9c4c107-ea65-3305-b92d-e904e12f1b2d,GE,2023-06-01,Should You Investigate General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) At US$102?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-general-electric-company-nyse-110113272.html,1685617273,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at General Electric’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric What Is General Electric Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy General Electric today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $115.42, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since General Electric’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from General Electric?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -16% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for General Electric. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? GE seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on GE should the price fluctuate below its true value.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for General Electric (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in General Electric, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

GE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Washington is working to deepen ties with the world's largest democracy and sees deeper military-to-military and technology ties with the South Asian country as a key counterweight to China's dominance in the region.India, the world's largest arm importer, depends on Russia for nearly half its military supplies, and has bought fighter jets, tanks, nuclear submarines and an aircraft carrier over the decades.New Delhi has frustrated Washington by participating in military exercises with Russia and increasing purchases of the country's crude oil, a key source of funding for Moscow's war in Ukraine.India's state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) had previously said it planned to use the GE-manufactured 414 engine on a second generation of light-combat aircraft and that it was in talks over domestic production of those engines.The deal is not finalized and also requires notification to the U.S. Congress, according to two of the people briefed on the arrangement.Washington maintains strict controls over what domestic military technology can be shared or sold to other countries.A broader joint partnership between the United States and India announced earlier this year is designed to encourage companies from both countries to collaborate, especially on military equipment and cutting-edge technology.Story continuesWhile GE has offered some transfer of technology to HAL, which will produce the engines as a licensed manufacturer, India is pushing for more technology to be shared, according to one of the people with knowledge of the conversations.India is keen to get the know-how to make aircraft engines. Though it can manufacture fighter jets domestically, it lacks the ability to produce engines to power them.HAL is using a lighter GE engine for the 83 light combat aircraft it is manufacturing for the Indian air force. However, India intends to produce more than 350 fighter jets for its air force and navy over the next two decades, which could be powered by the GE 414.(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington, Krishn Kaushik in New Delhi and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Edited by Heather Timmons and Jamie Freed)]"

This led to the impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.The company’s adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share surged 86.2% year over year. Net sales grew 5.9% to $2,346.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 8.2%, driven by favorable price and sales mix, offset by a slight decline in financial volume. Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from premiumization.Molson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. The company intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer without hampering the support for its existing large brands; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, Molson Coors plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying the structure. The company is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Its cost-saving program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Molson Coors is committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Driven by these factors, management projects sales year-over-year growth in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis, in line with our estimate of 1.5% growth. Underlying EBT is likely to grow year over year in the low-single digits on a constant-currency basis. Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $690 million, plus or minus 5%. The company expects an underlying effective tax rate of 21-23%. Consolidated net interest expenses are anticipated to be $240 million, plus or minus 5%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 13.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5%.However, the company continues to witness lower brand and financial volume. In first-quarter 2023, Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes fell 2.1% to 16.2 million due to sluggishness in America, as well as EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes declined 0.2% to 17 million hectoliters due to lower volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Also, inflationary pressure related to materials, conversion and energy costs, and mixed impacts of portfolio premiumization act as deterrents. TAP has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry mainly due to pricing actions.ConclusionWe believe that brand strength, product innovation, pricing actions, premiumization of its global portfolio and revitalization plan are likely to drive growth for Molson Coors. Earnings estimates for TAP’s current financial year have increased 6.4% to $4.34 over the past 30 days. Topping it, long-term growth of 4.2% and a VGM Score of B raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Procter &amp; Gamble PG, Conagra Brands CAG and Celsius Holdings CELH.Conagra Brands, operating as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Stericycle's current trading price of US$42.83 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Stericycle’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Stericycle What's The Opportunity In Stericycle?Great news for investors – Stericycle is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $67.03, but it is currently trading at US$42.83 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Stericycle’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Stericycle?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Stericycle. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SRCL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SRCL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SRCL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

401,309ff09e-0419-3d10-92d5-82403a6a49ec,VNO,2023-06-01,Why Is Vornado (VNO) Down 1.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-vornado-vno-down-1-153038627.html,1685547038,STORY,"['VNO', 'DLR']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Vornado (VNO). Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Vornado due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Vornado’s FFO Misses Estimates in Q1, Revenues BeatVornado Realty’s first-quarter 2023 FFO plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share of 60 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Moreover, the figure declined 24.1% year over year.Quarterly results displayed better-than-anticipated revenues aided by healthy leasing activity. However, higher operating expenses acted as a dampener.Total revenues came in at $445.9 million in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $443.7 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved nearly 1%. Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, total same-store net operating income (NOI) (at share) came in at $264.6 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $264.7 million. The metric for the New York and 555 California Street portfolios improved 1.6% and 4.3%, respectively. However, the same-store NOI (at share) for THE MART portfolio declined 22.6% from the prior-year period.Operating expenses flared up 5.7% to $228.8 million year over year.During the quarter, in the New York office portfolio, 777,000 square feet of office space (771,000 square feet at share) was leased for an initial rent of $101.02 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 9.5 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $2.48 per square foot per annum or 2.5% of the initial rent.In the New York retail portfolio, 25,000 square feet were leased (20,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $373.07 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 6.8 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $26.54 per square foot per annum or 7.1% of the initial rent.Additionally, at THE MART, 79,000 square feet of space (all at share) was leased for an initial rent of $56.44 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 6.8 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $8.04 per square foot per annum or 14.2% of the initial rent.For VNO’s 555 California Street portfolio, 4,000 square feet of space (3,000 square feet at share) was leased for an initial rent of $156.96 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of seven years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $39.07 per square foot per annum, or 24.9% of the initial rent.Vornado ended the quarter with occupancy in the New York portfolio at 89.9%, down 130 basis points (bps) year over year. Occupancy in THE MART declined to 80.3% from 88.9%. However, occupancy in 555 California Street improved 70 bps to 94.9%.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityIn the reported quarter, Vornado and Rudin closed the earlier announced transactions related to their 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street properties with Citadel Enterprise Americas LLC (“Citadel”) and with an affiliate of Kenneth C. Griffin, Citadel’s Founder and CEO (“KG”).Additionally, Vornado entered into a joint venture (JV) with Rudin (“Vornado/Rudin”) to purchase 39 East 51st Street for $40 million. Upon the formation of the KG JV, VNO intends to combine this property with 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street to create a premier development site, to be known as “Site” collectively. The transaction is expected to be completed in second-quarter 2023.Balance SheetVornado exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $890.9 million, slightly up from $889.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Vornado has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Vornado has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVornado is part of the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry. Over the past month, Digital Realty Trust (DLR), a stock from the same industry, has gained 6.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Digital Realty Trust reported revenues of $1.34 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.8%. EPS of $0.19 for the same period compares with $1.67 a year ago.Digital Realty Trust is expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Digital Realty Trust.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:Through the morning session of May 24th, we have seen Q1 results from 489 S&amp;P 500 members, or 97.8% of the index’s membership. Total Q1 earnings for these companies are down -3.7% on +4.4% higher revenues, with 78.1% beating EPS estimates and 74.6% beating revenue estimates.In terms of earnings growth, 2023 Q1 earnings were below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Basic Materials (-29.4%), Construction (-19.1%), Medical (-17.7%), Conglomerates (-9.2%), Technology (-11.7%), and Consumer Staples (-2.2%) having notable declines.Sectors enjoying positive earnings growth in 2023 Q1 include Transportation (+56.9%), Consumer Discretionary (+31.2%), Aerospace (+15.7%), Energy (+15.5%), Finance (+1.4%), Retail (+3.1%), Autos (+10.4%), Business Services (+2.1%), and Industrial Products (+17.0%).For 2023 Q2, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are now expected to be down -9% on -0.6% lower revenues. This is down from the expected earnings and revenue declines of -7.2% and -0.5%, respectively, on March 29th.The earnings picture defied the skeptics again in the 2023 Q1 earnings season, with companies not only handily beating estimates but also providing reassuring enough guidance for the current coming quarters.Story continuesWe are not suggesting that earnings are great, because they are not. After all, earnings growth is on track to be negative for the second quarter in a row, with the trend of declining profits expected to continue in the current period (2023 Q2) as well as the one after that.We tend to dwell a lot on the Technology and Finance sectors as we look for earnings trends in the aggregate, as these two sectors combined account for so much of the total earnings pie. Over the coming four quarters, these two sectors are expected to bring in 44% of all S&amp;P 500 earnings. As such, what happens in these two sectors significantly impacts the aggregate growth picture.The focus of today’s report is to feature the earnings outlook of the Zacks Construction sector, one of the stand-alone Zacks economic sectors that we feel differentiates us from the conventional sector classification (we have 16 sectors vs. the 11 sectors in the ‘standard’ system).As an interest rate-sensitive sector, the Construction sector’s profitability has been significantly affected by higher interest rates as a result of Fed tightening. The sector’s earnings this year are currently expected to decline by -21.8%, which would follow earnings growth of +21.5% in 2022, +45% in 2021, and +24.5% in 2020.But as you can see in this chart, the sector’s profitability outlook is not only stable but actually positive. This favorable earnings outlook also comes through when we look at the sector’s earnings estimate revisions trend, which turned positive recently after remaining negative since April 2022.In fact, 2023 earnings estimates for the sector got cut the most out of all Zacks sectors as the full extent of the Fed’s tightening cycle took hold last year. From their peak in April last year, 2023 earnings estimates for the Zacks Construction sector have been cut by almost -27%.The Construction sector was hardly alone in experiencing this negative revisions trend, as estimates for most sectors adjusted lower over this time period.However, the Construction sector has been notably experiencing a trend reversal lately, with estimates for the group notably moving higher since the start of April 2023.You can see this recent favorable turn in the revisions trend by looking at the individual companies in the Zacks Construction sector, of which the 12 that are in the S&amp;P 500 index are listed in the bottom left of the chart above. Take, for example, homebuilders D.R. Horton DHI, PulteGroup PHM and NVR NVR.D.R. Horton is currently expected to bring in $11.18 per share this year on $32.3 billion in revenues. The current $11.18 per share estimate is up +23.2% since March 31st.As you can see in the D.R. Horton chart above, current estimates are down significantly relative to where they stood a year ago, but they are nevertheless starting to trend up. We see the same trend at play with PulteGroup, NVR, and others.Using PulteGroup as an example, the current estimate for 2023 of $9.05 per share is up +21.6% since March 31st, while the same for NVR is up +7.4% over the same time period.Knowing this recent favorable turn in the group’s earnings estimate revisions trend puts the group’s stock market outperformance in the correct context.The Earnings Big PictureAs we have pointed out all along, aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 peaked in April last year and consistently came down since then. Even accounting for the aforementioned favorable revisions trend in recent weeks, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates have declined by -13.2% since the April 2022 peak and -14.6% on an ex-Energy basis.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The Justice Department sued to block the alliance, and a federal judge ruled last week that the partnership violates antitrust law.“We've got a system that allows for appeal, and we are going to do that,” American CEO Robert Isom said during an investor conference. “In the meantime, we are going to have to work with (the Justice Department), work with JetBlue, to find out exactly what we do in the interim.”American could seek a stay of the judge's order while it appeals.The Justice Department declined to comment.Losing the alliance would be a setback for American, which would need to find another way to grow in New York and Boston, where it has retreated over many years in the face of competition from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.However, the exact cost of losing the Northeast Alliance, as the deal with JetBlue is called, is not clear. American's Chief Financial Officer Devon May said at the same Bernstein conference that the partnership's demise would not have a significant impact on the airline's operating profit margin, but he did not provide a revenue-loss figure.U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston ruled that with their partnership, American and JetBlue were “replacing full-throated competition with broad cooperation.” The judge dismissed the airlines' argument — which Isom repeated on Wednesday — that the deal helps consumers by creating more competition against Delta and United in New York and Boston.Many of Isom's comments Wednesday dealt with the airline raising its second-quarter profit forecast because of higher revenue and lower fuel costs during the start of the summer travel season than it had predicted in April.Story continuesThe nation's biggest airline said it expects to earn between $1.45 and $1.65 per share, or 25 cents better than its earlier forecast. The numbers exclude certain costs. American did not, however, change its financial outlook for the full year.Savanthi Syth, an airline analyst for Raymond James, said airline revenue will be strong over summer due to vacation travel, but the fall — when business flying is a higher share of revenue — “remains in question.” Corporate travel has recovered from the pandemic more slowly than leisure travel.Shares of American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in Forth Worth, Texas, rose 1% on Wednesday.]"

American Airlines showing some strength today, the company raising its expectations for adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to $1.45 to $1.65. That's the range. That is up from the previous range of $1.20 to $1.40. They're saying that this is going to be the busiest summer for air travel since-- checks watch-- prepandemic.American's stock popping on this news. It's up by about 1.7% here as we're keeping a close tab on shares of AAL. Also perhaps worth keeping tabs on some of the other airlines that could be moving in concert. I'm thinking about DAL as well on the day as they've already signaled where that strong demand is. We've heard that from Ed Bastian who talked about this in their most recent earnings as well.And a lot of the theme that you're sensing from many of the travel names, whether it's our conversations with Delta CEO Ed Bastian or whether it's with United Airlines CEO and even Airbnb CEO, Brian Chesky, it's that the travel and services within the experience economy are still continuing to do strong as consumers are prioritizing that purchase here as much of that pent-up demand continues to permeate, even into years after when it was set to come back and forth for us as people were just looking to get out of the house.We're now multiple years removed from that, and people are still spending on those experiences.- Yes, they are. Let's put some numbers around this. If you look at the TSA numbers over the Memorial Day weekend-- the four days of Memorial Day weekend-- 9.8 million passengers, almost, through those airport screening checkpoints. That is 300,000 higher, not only than last year, not only in the year before that, not only than during the pandemic, than 2019. 300,000 more than 2019.So obviously, you're seeing this uptick since then. So there's the demand. That's just to put a little color around that. Then you have the fuel part of this, which is important for American Airlines. The company now says in the second quarter-- in its fiscal second quarter-- it's going to pay in a range $0.10 less per gallon for its average fuel.Story continuesSo fuel prices are going down. Demand is robust. That's a good equation for them.- Yeah, it's a trend that's locked in right now. Q1, you actually saw-- that was the first quarter, first full quarter since prepandemic that we had actually beat those prepandemic numbers for the entirety and actually came in at 102% of a prepandemic marker there. And so that-- considerable in the first quarter, and seeing that over the entirety of that three-month stretch.And so it seems with that trend locked in, American Airlines, United Airlines, even Delta as well, a lot of the airlines right now are signaling that this is something that they can continue to ride the tailwinds of, if you will. I know I was in those numbers as well over the weekend.]"

The necessary upgrade and maintenance of the water tanks will assist the company in protecting water quality and increasing the effective service life of the storage tanks. Kentucky American Water owns and operates 26 water storage tanks throughout its service area.Over the past few years, Kentucky American Water has invested more than $100 million in infrastructure improvements, such as replacing aging water pipes, upgrading water treatment facilities and refurbishing water storage tanks. Tanks undergo inspections every five years with more extensive refurbishment conducted every 15 to 20 years. It is essential to ensure proper maintenance of the water infrastructure, which allows the company to maintain its 24x7 high-quality water services for its customers.Systematic Investments Essential for Water IndustryAging water and wastewater infrastructure is a concern for the water industry. It is evident from the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) that due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. So, delays in the repair and maintenance of the storage water tanks could increase the problem further.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructures like storage tanks and purifying units, need maintenance at proper intervals.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for the 10 years of 2023-2032. Last week, Pennsylvania American Water decided to invest $17.5 million in 2023 to upgrade and maintain eight of its water storage tanks and construct five new tanks to cater to the rising demand for water.Story continuesUtilities Making InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investments to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure, as well as making provisions for adding new infrastructure, will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand.Water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve the water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WTRG’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 5.1%. The long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth of WTRG is currently pegged at 5.6%. The current dividend yield of Essential Utilities is 2.8%.California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CWT’s 2023 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 4.5%. The current dividend yield of California Water Service is 1.9%.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSEX’s 2023 and 2024 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 5.9% and 4.7%, respectively. The current dividend yield of Middlesex Water is 1.6%.Price PerformanceShares of AWK have rallied 3.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.2% return. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAmerican Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:FCX) institutional owners after losing 12% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-freeport-114317456.html,1685619797,STORY,['FCX'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Freeport-McMoRan's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Recent purchases by insiders A look at the shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$1.6b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 12% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Freeport-McMoRan. Check out our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Freeport-McMoRan?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Freeport-McMoRan does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Freeport-McMoRan's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Freeport-McMoRan. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 6.4% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Freeport-McMoRanThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Freeport-McMoRan Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$236m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Freeport-McMoRan. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Freeport-McMoRan better, we need to consider many other factors.

The executives were tense after hearing a state of the company report that was less than flattering. And I knew how we could address it.I was pitching a program that would save (and possibly make more) money, help us set and achieve better goals, and bring our people along with us. The program: A transformation driven by change management principles.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesOrganizations like Mercer, Boston Consulting, and McKinsey offer change management as part of their transformation services. The principles were likely applied at your own organization if the company changed technologies, needed to reduce expenses, or attempted to renovate company culture.PepsiCo has been undergoing its own transformation over the past few years, led by Athina Kanioura, the consumer sector giant’s chief transformation officer. The goal? To become a tech company that happens to sell snacks and beverages. We talked with Kanioura on a recent episode of Reworking Work to understand how PepsiCo has leveraged change management principles to fuel its transformation.Change management helps hone company prioritiesGetting the executive team onboard and focused on what matters is one of the first objectives of a transformation initiative. Unfortunately, many organizations overcommit and take on too many priorities, stretching their people thin. PepsiCo was no different.The company started with a series of questions to help them downsize the number and size of their priorities. “How impactful is it for the business?” Kanioura asked. “What is the complexity of delivery and implementation, and what is its impact on our people?”She also had to demonstrate how the transformation would help the business become better and faster. To build a baseline of understanding, Kanioura told stories of the current and future state of their financial ambitions and their operations.Story continuesCreating a change toolkit for the companyAfter gaining executive agreement that change was needed, she needed to ensure everyone knew how to change. For that, PepsiCo created a change management playbook outlining how to address gaps, providing foundational elements of change, and tailoring the learning and training experiences. Next, she and her team created a value realization framework, which was used as a testing mechanism for the programs they were implementing. The framework helped them ensure they were focused on the right things and were on budget. It also helped leadership assess what programs needed to be stopped to create room for new ways of working. Last, they created a scorecard that’s reviewed by the executive team quarterly.The framework has helped PepsiCo test out ideas and quickly assess if they are viable and valuable to current efforts. Kanioura said the most significant change was not just stopping the projects but getting back the time spent in meetings discussing initiatives that weren’t adding as much return on their time. This, too, is tracked on the framework scorecard.Building a team to lead the changeA team effectively leading the change is necessary for any transformation or change initiative. Kanioura knew she wanted a team that was 50% tenured PepsiCo employees to ensure she had the history and intellectual property that came before the transformation. The employees who stepped into these roles had to have good networks and a keen understanding of how the company operates now in order to know what to change.Kanioura also wanted people on her team with both a “major” and a “minor.” For example, a data engineer’s major might be technical expertise. But, perhaps they’ve also worked on supply chain projects, know the operations fairly well, and are passionate about this part of the business. That makes supply chain their minor. These multi-hyphenates can cover a lot of ground, driving change at a faster pace.Next, she assessed their soft skills. Common problems to change, like hoarding information or being the hero that handles it all, wouldn’t be allowed. Lastly, Kanioura wanted her team to reflect society and be just as diverse as PepsiCo’s clients—a goal she accomplished with over 50% diversity.Leverage change to boost career pathingPepsiCo wasn’t approaching this as a technology transformation, but a company transformation. On the heels of the great resignation and quiet quitting trends, they wanted to ensure their employees could envision a career beyond where they were then.For starters, they created paths to become a general manager, role that allows someone to easily move from a technical path to a non-technical path and vice versa.By looking for transferable skills, they’re opening up career paths and building on the “major and minor” thinking. Diversifying their own talent’s skill sets builds a workforce of digital savvy players, whom Kanioura believes will create the pool of candidates for future CEOs.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Canadian National Railway Co. CNI, Union Pacific Corp. UNP, Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC and CSX Corp. CSX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Are Railroad Companies Becoming More Employee Friendly?The Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being weighed down by challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel prices and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 4% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.7% appreciation and 2.4% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, it has been an encouraging move on railroad companies’ part to take care of employees’ needs by entering into collective deals with the unions. Companies like Canadian National Railway Co., Union Pacific Corp., Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. have tried to address their employees’ requirements through multiple initiatives such as by increasing their paid sick leaves, offering them better working schedules to ensure a balanced personal and professional life and improving working conditions.Each of the abovementioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Canadian National recently announced that its collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) has been ratified. The union represents almost 6,000 Canadian National locomotive engineers, conductors, yard conductors and yard coordinators working in Canada.Story continuesTracy Robinson, president and chief executive officer of CNI, stated, “We are pleased that TCRC members have ratified the collective agreement reached earlier this year. We thank the TCRC leadership for their engagement throughout this process.  We remain committed to working with this important group to ensure continued service for our customers and improved working conditions for our team members.""Union Pacific has entered into a tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The deal is aimed at improving the quality of life for Union Pacific’s locomotive engineers and their families by offering them better working schedules.UNP employs nearly 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET. The tentative deal offers locomotive engineers 11 days on and four days off schedule. This deal should help UNP progress productively with its employees with the new work/rest schedules.Norfolk Southern has entered into an agreement with BLET, aimed at offering up to seven paid sick days per year to BLET members. This deal will offer five new days of paid sick leave per year to Norfolk Southern engineers. Further, it will also provide them the flexibility to use up to two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.The deal covers more than 3,300 Norfolk Southern engineers, representing almost 25% of the NS craft workforce. With this agreement, almost all the company's craft employees — approximately 98% — have entered into paid sick leave deals.CSX announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division CSRA (SMART-TD CSRA), aimed at offering paid sick leave benefits. This deal (which is pending ratification by union members) is the 10th one between CSX and its union-represented employees since February. Most of CSX’s unionized workers now have paid sick leave benefits.SMART-TD CSRA represents trainmen, conductors and yardmen on territories of CSX’s Atlanta and West Point railroad, Winston-Salem Southbound railway, Louisville and Nashville railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad.Such agreements reflect the employee-friendly attitude of the railroad companies through which they try to maintain cordial relations with employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere. These efforts should also help the companies retain and recruit more employees.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Learn more here.The Pacific Railway Act of 1862 was enacted by President Abraham Lincoln to garner federal support for construction of the transcontinental railroad.While B&amp;O Railroad was the first commercial transportation by rail in 1827, connecting Chicago to the East Coast, there still was not a direct connection completely west.The goal was to spread geographically throughout the United States and help move goods and people faster and more safely. The desire to expand the country west became more important after the discovery of gold in California.According to the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), Central Pacific Railroad in Sacramento, California, and Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha, Nebraska, began the project, laying tracks under a federal government contract, supported by government land grants and bonds. To push productivity, the companies were also compensated $16,000 for each mile of track in the Sierra Nevadas and east of the Rockies.The extra compensation began a race that lasted seven years between the two companies, each hoping to lay the most track.The DPLA shared an exhibition of some of the photographs taken and illustrations created at that time to show the rush toward California. Here is a gallery of some of the most interesting photos from the collection.A map of the Union Pacific Railroad route in 1868.

Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 4% so far this year, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 10.7% appreciation and 2.4% rise of the broader Zacks Transportation sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the challenges surrounding the industry, it has been an encouraging move on railroad companies’ part to take care of employees’ needs by entering into collective deals with the unions. Companies like Canadian National Railway Company (CNI), Union Pacific Corporation (UNP), Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC and CSX Corporation CSX have tried to address their employees’ requirements through multiple initiatives such as by increasing their paid sick leaves, offering them better working schedules to ensure a balanced personal and professional life and improving working conditions.Each of the abovementioned stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Canadian National recently announced that its collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) has been ratified. The union represents almost 6,000 Canadian National locomotive engineers, conductors, yard conductors and yard coordinators working in Canada.Tracy Robinson, president and chief executive officer of CNI, stated, “We are pleased that TCRC members have ratified the collective agreement reached earlier this year. We thank the TCRC leadership for their engagement throughout this process.  We remain committed to working with this important group to ensure continued service for our customers and improved working conditions for our team members.""Story continuesUnion Pacific has entered into a tentativeagreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The deal is aimed at improving the quality of life for Union Pacific’s locomotive engineers and their families by offering them better working schedules.UNP employs nearly 5,600 locomotive engineers represented by BLET. The tentative deal offers locomotive engineers 11 days on and four days off schedule. This deal should help UNP progress productively with its employees with the new work/rest schedules.Norfolk Southern has entered into an agreement with BLET, aimed at offering up to seven paid sick days per year to BLET members. This deal will offer five new days of paid sick leave per year to Norfolk Southern engineers. Further, it will also provide them the flexibility to use up to two additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.The deal covers more than 3,300 Norfolk Southern engineers, representing almost 25% of the NS craft workforce. With this agreement, almost all the company's craft employees — approximately 98% — have entered into paid sick leave deals.CSX announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement with the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers-Transportation Division CSRA (SMART-TD CSRA), aimed at offering paid sick leave benefits. This deal (which is pending ratification by union members) is the 10th one between CSX and its union-represented employees since February. Most of CSX’s unionized workers now have paid sick leave benefits.SMART-TD CSRA represents trainmen, conductors and yardmen on territories of CSX’s Atlanta and West Point railroad, Winston-Salem Southbound railway, Louisville and Nashville railroad, Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway and Seaboard Coast Line railroad.Such agreements reflect the employee-friendly attitude of the railroad companies through which they try to maintain cordial relations with employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere. These efforts should also help the companies retain and recruit more employees.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They are the homes and sources of livelihood for an estimated 1.3 billion people, and the areas with the most biodiversity on land. Intact, primary forests all over the planet - which have 40x higher carbon sequestration potential per hectare than new plantation forests - have already been reduced to less than one-fifth of their original extent through industrial logging and other kinds of deforestation.Nicole Rycroft, Founder and Executive Director of Canopy Planet, has spent the last 25 years protecting the world's forests, advancing international human rights, and sparking the shift to a global green economy. She is an Ashoka Fellow, member of the UBS Global Visionaries program, recipient of the Meritorious Service Cross of Canada, winner of the 2020 Climate Breakthrough Award and a 2022 Global Australian of the Year. Nicole spearheads Canopy's strategic direction and many of Canopy's senior level partnerships.Canopy's partnership with the Cisco Foundation is built on a shared belief that supporting innovation at scale to address significant social problems has the potential to achieve a global impact. We see great synergies between our organizations as Canopy works to catalyze a transformation in the extractive pulp, paper, packaging, and viscose supply chains by spurring the commercial-production of low-impact Next Generation Solutions (Next Gen) to mitigate the climate crisis.Let's start with the basics. What is Canopy Planet, and what do you do? Nicole: Canopy is an award-winning, solutions-driven NGO dedicated to protecting the world's forests, species, and climate and advancing Indigenous and frontline communities' rights. We do this by harnessing the purchasing influence of the global marketplace to transform supply chains that are driving deforestation and forest degradation. Since our inception in 1999, Canopy's unique model of change has been based on building transformational partnerships with hundreds of the world's largest brands. We leverage our 900+ brand partners' purchasing clout to create the economic incentives to transform unsustainable supply chains, catalyze commercial-production of low-carbon Next Generation Solutions, and secure landscape-level forest conservation and community rights. We are dedicated to helping conserve 30 -50% of the world's forests by 2030.Story continuesCan you share more about the impact of logging on ecosystems? Nicole: In 2021 alone, we lost more than 25 million hectares of forests globally, releasing ten billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Logging for pulp, paper, packaging, textiles, and solid wood products is a carbon intensive supply chain that perpetuates a ‘take, make, waste' model that drives the degradation and loss of climate-critical forests.With forests foundational to life on Earth, we need to accelerate the transition from forest-based goods like packaging and viscose to production that relies on circular and low-impact feedstocks that keep forests standing - places like the Leuser Ecosystem in Indonesia, one of Canopy's Landscapes of Hope. The Leuser Ecosystem is one of the world's richest intact tropical rainforest ecosystems. It is the last place on earth where the Sumatran elephant, rhino, tiger and orangutan are found within one area, and it provides habitat for thousands of mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, and plant species. In addition, the Leuser Ecosystem is the life-support system for seven million people that rely on it for clean air, water, flood protection, irrigation, medicines, and their livelihoods. Continued unsustainable demand for forest products puts places like the Leuser Ecosystem at peril.Cutting down forests is not just about paper. Can you share more about all the kinds of products, packaging and textiles logging supports? Nicole: The connection between fashion and forests isn't immediately apparent, but the third largest group of fashion textiles - rayon and viscose - is derived from trees. So is the packaging in which fashion and many other goods are shipped around the world. Over 3.4 billion trees are logged annually to make textiles and packaging and when you add in paper, that number is a staggering 5.1 billion. Much of this logging occurs in the world's most ecologically and culturally valuable forests, which Canopy calls Ancient and Endangered Forests. These landscapes are pivotal to life on earth. The pressure on forests is only intensifying: packaging has increased by 65% over the past two decades, while the use of trees to make fabrics has more than tripled. Both are projected to grow significantly in the coming years.What are some of Canopy Planet's major accomplishments so far?Nicole: Some of our accomplishments include:Helping over 900 brands develop and implement robust environmental purchasing policies for their paper, packaging and viscose textiles.Showing that Being Stylish Doesn't Have to Cost the Earth. We launched CanopyStyle in 2013 to transform the viscose supply chain and keep Ancient and Endangered Forests off the runways and out of our wardrobes. Today, 536 brands representing USD 905 billion in annual revenues have developed CanopyStyle polices to end sourcing from Ancient and Endangered Forests and to prioritize the use of Next Gen alternatives. More than half of global viscose production is now verified at low-risk of containing high-carbon, biodiverse forests and the first Next Gen textiles are now available and on the market.Launching Pack4Good in 2019 to ensure we don't continue to mow down 400-year-old trees to make shipping boxes and take out containers. In just three years, the Pack4Good campaign has secured 390 brands worth a collective USD 199 billion in annual revenues. Pack4Good has also been moving the needle on the production side: leverage from global brands has resulted in packaging producers signing policies to end sourcing from critical forest ecosystems and to invest in Next Gen. Momentum is growing every day, so watch this space.Developing Next Gen Solutions over a decade ago. Canopy has been the only NGO promoting diversifying the fiber basket as a key strategy for forest protection. To date, we have directly catalyzed 300,000 tonnes of new annual Next Gen production into the market and we are linked to an additional 1.7 million tonnes of new production in development. Just last month, Canopy's ambitious plan to catalyze 60 million tonnes of Next Gen in the next ten years was recognized by The Audacious Project, a TED initiative. Alongside of our work with the Cisco Foundation, the support from Audacious will supercharge our work to catalyze the global scale-up of Next Gen production - and in doing so take the pressure off forests so we can conserve more than 220 million acres of forests globally.Securing conservation in 41+ million acres of forests to date through our work with brands and local NGO partners.Can you tell us more about Next Gen pulp technologies? You previously mentioned partnering with the first pulp recycling plant. Nicole: What many people don't know is that there is a strong pipeline of forest-free, clean-production pulp alternatives ready for market - such as paper pulp made from straw, and textile pulp made from discarded cotton textiles. While we call these Next Generation Solutions, they are actually a new spin on rediscovered inputs used for paper and textiles for millennia - flax, hemp, recycled fabrics. Despite their ubiquity now, forests are actually relatively new fiber sources, having only entered industrial pulp production within the last 150 years.Next Gen pulps have 95 to 130% fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They have 88% to 100% less land-use impact, and at least 5x lower impact on biodiversity and threatened species. Further, by using clean production processes and creating a profitable use for inputs that would otherwise be discarded in landfills, burned, or disposed of at a cost to farmers, these pulps contribute to healthier, more profitable communities and avoid secondary pollution issues. And best of all for brands and buyers: Next Gen pulp products perform just as well as their conventional peers - and are projected to be comparable in price or cheaper once produced at scale.Canopy is supporting independent innovators to scale their technologies, informing commercial-scale approaches for previously niche products, and encouraging adoption by mainstream producers for retrofitting existing conventional mills. Last year, we were on site in Sundsvall, Sweden to celebrate the official opening of Renewcell, the world's first commercial-scale, textile-to-textile Next Gen pulp mill for viscose production. Instead of requiring huge swaths of forests to be cut every year, Renewcell uses hundreds of millions of old jeans and t-shirts as its input. Renewcell carries five tonnes less carbon per tonne of product than conventional wood-based pulp. It uses 90% less water, is built in the bones of an old shuttered wood mill, and has re-employed 100 of the staff.In addition to Renewcell, we are currently working with a pipeline of more than 30 other Next Gen innovators who are turning ideas that sounded like science fiction five years ago into elegant, versatile solutions for today. Canopy has also played a vital role in generating strong market pull-through, with hundreds of brand policies and over half a million tonnes in explicit purchase demand from leading brands.I also understand you use some cutting-edge software for your work, including the Eco-Paper Database (EPD) and ForestMapper. What kind of information do they provide? And how can people access them?Nicole: The EcoPaper Database is the world's largest database of high recycled content and Next Gen packaging and paper. Today, it includes more than 1100 listings of Ancient Forest Friendly™ and other packaging and paper products that use high amounts of lower footprint feedstock including recycled and Next Gen materials.ForestMapper is an interactive map developed by scientific and mapping experts to help buyers and suppliers locate Ancient and Endangered Forests and identify areas of potential sourcing risk to assist in the transition to more sustainable supply chains. It is the only tool of its kind to visually represent Ancient and Endangered Forests at a global scale and includes information on forests, species, carbon and landscapes. We're working with leading scientists on an update of ForestMapper for later in 2023.Both ForestMapper and the EcoPaper Database are free of charge and designed to be user-friendly. They can both be found on Canopy's website under the Tools and Resources section.You were at COP27. What kind of engagement did you receive there? Nicole: COP27 marked an important milestone for Canopy as partners announced a collective commitment to purchase over half a million tonnes of low-carbon, low-footprint Next Gen packaging and textile alternatives once they're commercially online. This bold public statement was designed to send a signal to the investment community and help unlock the capital needed to build commercial-scale Next Gen pulp mills as well as conventional producers. Over the next two to three years, we anticipate we will secure the financing necessary to build 12 - 15 Next Gen mills, preventing an estimated 22 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually and providing communities with an alternative to burning straw and landfilling textiles.The market pull-through announced at COP27 is essential to de-risking these new supply chains and attracting the scale of investment necessary to rapidly scale these game-changing Next Gen alternatives. Canopy will be doing more of this over the coming years but this bold initial commitment by our partners at COP was a positive step forward for the planet and low-carbon supply chains.How do you assist or partner with local communities, including Indigenous peoples in the areas Canopy Planet works in?Nicole: Canopy has strong relationships with Indigenous leaders and local NGOs across North America and around the world. We support the efforts of our on-the-ground partners and Indigenous leaders by bringing the influence of the international market at strategic junctures to advance robust conservation of key landscapes and support the development of conservation-based economies for local communities. It is our local and international partners that largely lead policy negotiations with local governments and community economic development. Canopy brings critical leverage that creates the economic and political incentives for industry and governments to change ‘business as usual'. This can range from brands participating in customer roundtables with political and forest industry decision makers to encourage a more sustainable path forward for both the forests and communities. We work with some of our brand partners to directly fund on the ground conservation efforts through investments in robust carbon offset programs or philanthropic programs focused on advancing biodiversity. Many of our brand partners have stopped sourcing from suppliers that have operations in high-carbon, biodiverse landscapes and link future purchasing to large-scale conservation and advancements in human-wellbeing for Indigenous and local communities.We have also been proud to support conservation efforts by Indigenous leaders and local NGOs in Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, the Cree Nation's territory in the Boreal Forest, and Indonesia's Leuser Ecosystem. To date, Canopy's market leverage has contributed to the protection of 41 million+ acres of Ancient and Endangered Forests around the world.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758261/Cisco-How-Canopy-Planet-Is-Empowering-Brands-To-Protect-the-Planets-Most-Vital-Resources]"
