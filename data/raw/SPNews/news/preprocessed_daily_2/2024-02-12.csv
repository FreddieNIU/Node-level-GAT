Since the Federal Reserve began raising rates amid inflationary pressures in March 2022, Schwab has seen significant deposit outflows, leading the company to tap the Federal Home Lending Bank (FHLB) and other resources to smooth outflows.', ""Over recent months, the deposit outflows at Schwab have slowed, and the fourth quarter showed more of the same. With the stock up 37% from its low last May and the prospect of interest rate cuts in 2024 on the table, is Schwab's stock still a buy?"", 'Charles Schwab has delivered solid returns for investors for decades thanks to its limited credit exposure and cost-efficient business model. The financial services company has historically relied on low-cost deposits that have led to a solid return on equity above its peer averages.', 'As a crucial component of its business model, Schwab relies heavily on deposits, most of which are in savings accounts that clients have yet to invest, to drive strong profit margins. While this has worked well for the company over the past decade, Charles Schwab has also struggled during periods of rising interest rates.', 'In 2017, the Federal Reserve began gradually increasing its federal funds rate, which eventually posed a problem for Charles Schwab called ""client cash sorting."" Rather than keep deposits in low-yielding accounts, many customers shifted funds to high-yield savings, CDs, or other relatively safe assets with appealing yields, which reduced its balance sheet and a sizable amount of those low-cost funds it relied on.', 'So when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in March 2022, Schwab faced client cash sorting problems again. The difference this time is that interest rates were rising in response to inflation, which was increasing year over year at its fastest rate in 40 years.', ""From August 2022 through March 2023, Charles Schwab lost deposits due to client cash sorting at a pace of $5.6 billion per month as yields on savings accounts or other safe short-term assets like certificates of deposits rose. These deposit outflow pressures slowed significantly following the regional banking crisis. From June through December last year, Schwab's deposits continued to decline, but at the pace of $1.1 billion monthly."", ""The pace of Schwab's outflows is moderating, which is helped by the Federal Reserve's recent pause on its interest rate hiking campaign. With rates moderating and possibly coming down, Schwab could see those deposit pressures begin to diminish. That would be a welcome sign for the company, which will look to reduce higher-cost funding sources, like retail certificates of deposit and FHLB advances."", 'Charles Schwab is still managing its outflows, and the primary risk to the company is interest rates remaining higher for longer than anticipated. That could result in more outflows and put pressure on the share price. However, it seems more likely rates will go down. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are pricing in five interest rate cuts by year-end.', ""With the prospect of interest rate cuts, Charles Schwab's valuation is quite reasonable. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.6, which is close to its 10-year average. However, based on one-year forward earnings, it trades at just 14.2."", 'Given its reasonable valuation, Charles Schwab looks like a good stock to buy today and add to through the year if interest rates do indeed fall, which would take significant pressure off its declining deposit base.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Charles Schwab right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Charles Schwab wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and its performance last year, and go directly to read 5 Best Regional Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy.\xa0', ""In 2023, the American banking sector faced a significant crisis that nearly led to a loss of trust among the public. During the spring of that year, several well-known regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, experienced sudden collapses. What made these downfalls particularly alarming was their widespread impact, as they occurred across different geographical areas. Furthermore, the reasons behind these failures were varied and complex, rather than stemming from a single cause. In the last quarter of 2023, profits within the US banking industry experienced a significant decline of nearly 45% compared to the previous year. This drop occurred despite a reduction in financial strain on consumers and a growing sense of optimism regarding the US economy's ability to steer clear of an immediate recession. The decline amounted to a decrease in profits to $38 billion, marking the most substantial year-on-year drop in quarterly profits since the second quarter of 2020, as reported by BankRegData, a data provider that consolidates quarterly reports submitted by lenders to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."", ""Investors who believed U.S. regional banks had recovered from last year's troubles were surprised by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)’s recent performance. The bank's earnings report led to a decline in regional bank shares, serving as a reminder to investors that the sector remains sensitive to changes in Federal Reserve interest rates, despite the passage of nearly a year since two banks failed. Investors mentioned that recent earnings of the bank highlighted the ongoing challenge faced by regional lenders due to high Federal Reserve rates. These rates are putting pressure on commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios and squeezing lending margins across the industry. The duration of that pressure will extend beyond initial expectations following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates unchanged. This move led traders to adjust their projections for the first rate hike, pushing it from March to May, as indicated by futures data."", 'Confidence in regional banks continued to face obstacles due to weak underlying factors, such as revenue being constrained by increased funding expenses and subdued lending activity. However, there are indications that the sentiment might be changing, as inflation rates decrease and the possibility of interest rate cuts emerges. Banks like KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), which were previously affected by banking uncertainties, have shown significant recovery since hitting lows in October. In addition to this, the banking sector concluded last year with a robust performance in terms of stock market activity. Towards the end of 2023, bank stocks experienced a notable surge, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index climbing approximately 27% during the last three months. The index is down 3.41% since the start of 2024.', ""Despite banking stocks’ relatively stable performance this year, analysts' assessments of the sector's prospects, particularly for regional banks, vary significantly. According to a report by Deloitte, regulatory pressures will strongly impact regional and small banks, especially those heavily focused on specific investment and lending sectors, as well as particular types of deposits. Throughout 2024, many banks will prioritize efforts to enhance lending criteria and broaden the range of assets in their balance sheets, reducing reliance on risky investments like commercial real estate (CRE) loans and even safer options like long-term treasuries. For this reason, certain midsize and regional banks may also consider pursuing mergers as a strategy to attract external capital, thereby facilitating the divestment of low-yielding assets."", 'In view of these arguments, we will discuss some of the best regional bank dividend stocks in this article.', 'Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge funds as of Q3 2023 and identified regional bank stocks that pay dividends.

Some are much better than others in terms of their quality, growth potential, and risk profile. The best dividend stocks are those that come from companies with a strong competitive advantage, reliable and increasing revenue, and healthy free cash flows.', 'Here are four dividend stocks that are proven wealth creators, making them top buys for the buy-and-hold crowd.', '1. Visa (NYSE: V) is a juggernaut in the digital payments space. As a result, the company has been able to generously reward its shareholders with a stunning dividend growth rate of 15.7% over the past five years.', 'This superb dividend growth rate also appears sustainable due to two key factors. First, Visa has a formidable competitive advantage in the digital payments industry. Second, it is a leader in a market that is growing by double digits annually right now.', ""So, while its yield of 0.75% may not be eye-catching, Visa's ultra-fast dividend growth rate and strong organic growth potential are solid reasons to buy its stock right now."", ""2. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is an oil and gas stalwart. Unlike Visa, ExxonMobil's five-year dividend growth rate of 1.77% isn't anything special. However, the oil and gas titan's stellar 3.73% annualized yield is more than twice that of the average stock listed on the S&P 500 index."", ""Plus, its smart cost-cutting strategies should keep its already robust free-cash-flow generation moving in the right direction, even with challenges from the industry's ongoing shift to renewables. In short, Exxon is a high-yield dividend stock that stands out as a reliable passive income play."", ""3. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is not just a big box retailer; it's a dividend powerhouse.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and its performance last year, and go directly to read 5 Best Regional Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy.\xa0', ""In 2023, the American banking sector faced a significant crisis that nearly led to a loss of trust among the public. During the spring of that year, several well-known regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, experienced sudden collapses. What made these downfalls particularly alarming was their widespread impact, as they occurred across different geographical areas. Furthermore, the reasons behind these failures were varied and complex, rather than stemming from a single cause. In the last quarter of 2023, profits within the US banking industry experienced a significant decline of nearly 45% compared to the previous year. This drop occurred despite a reduction in financial strain on consumers and a growing sense of optimism regarding the US economy's ability to steer clear of an immediate recession. The decline amounted to a decrease in profits to $38 billion, marking the most substantial year-on-year drop in quarterly profits since the second quarter of 2020, as reported by BankRegData, a data provider that consolidates quarterly reports submitted by lenders to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."", ""Investors who believed U.S. regional banks had recovered from last year's troubles were surprised by New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB)’s recent performance. The bank's earnings report led to a decline in regional bank shares, serving as a reminder to investors that the sector remains sensitive to changes in Federal Reserve interest rates, despite the passage of nearly a year since two banks failed. Investors mentioned that recent earnings of the bank highlighted the ongoing challenge faced by regional lenders due to high Federal Reserve rates. These rates are putting pressure on commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios and squeezing lending margins across the industry. The duration of that pressure will extend beyond initial expectations following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates unchanged. This move led traders to adjust their projections for the first rate hike, pushing it from March to May, as indicated by futures data."", 'Confidence in regional banks continued to face obstacles due to weak underlying factors, such as revenue being constrained by increased funding expenses and subdued lending activity. However, there are indications that the sentiment might be changing, as inflation rates decrease and the possibility of interest rate cuts emerges. Banks like KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) and Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), which were previously affected by banking uncertainties, have shown significant recovery since hitting lows in October. In addition to this, the banking sector concluded last year with a robust performance in terms of stock market activity. Towards the end of 2023, bank stocks experienced a notable surge, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index climbing approximately 27% during the last three months. The index is down 3.41% since the start of 2024.', ""Despite banking stocks’ relatively stable performance this year, analysts' assessments of the sector's prospects, particularly for regional banks, vary significantly. According to a report by Deloitte, regulatory pressures will strongly impact regional and small banks, especially those heavily focused on specific investment and lending sectors, as well as particular types of deposits. Throughout 2024, many banks will prioritize efforts to enhance lending criteria and broaden the range of assets in their balance sheets, reducing reliance on risky investments like commercial real estate (CRE) loans and even safer options like long-term treasuries. For this reason, certain midsize and regional banks may also consider pursuing mergers as a strategy to attract external capital, thereby facilitating the divestment of low-yielding assets."", 'In view of these arguments, we will discuss some of the best regional bank dividend stocks in this article.', 'Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology:', ""For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge funds as of Q3 2023 and identified regional bank stocks that pay dividends.

That makes the championship game a nearly ideal opportunity to pitch the online brokerage E-Trade to perhaps millions of people who aren't making the most of money they have to invest, said Andrea Zaretsky, the chief marketing officer for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management."", 'E-Trade\'s 30-second spot, featuring the brokerage\'s well-known talking babies in a round of pickleball, exhorts the audience to ""get in the game.""

She noted many considerations can influence the price, including how far in advance a firm enters into a deal to run a commercial."", 'Whatever the cost, the expenditures-per-viewer equation is likely to be favorable to advertisers this year. Not only does the Super Bowl feature two popular teams; it\'s also expected to benefit from the so-called ""Taylor Swift effect,"" drawing in viewers primarily interested in the romance between the Grammy-winning singer and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.', ""Charles Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova School of Business, has seen data from market research firm YouGov showing a 2% to 3% increase in E-Trade's favorability ratings for a month after it ran previous Super Bowl ads. That's a remarkable boost, he said, at a time when the fracturing of media has made it harder than ever to obtain a mass audience for any single ad."", '""It\'s the only venue left like this,"" Taylor said.

Instead, it takes a jab at the surging popularity of pickleball with the quip: ""It\'s basically tennis for babies, but for adults""', '""People really do like those talking babies,"" Taylor said. ""They do a good execution of it from year to year, and they are obviously getting good feedback.""', 'Financial service firms have had a somewhat mixed history with sports ads. There were the notorious spots in the 2022 championship game featuring celebrities like Larry David and Matt Damon hawking crypto-related products.

So far, Scott said, the response to E*Trade's commercial has been favorable."", ""Scott noted the students in her class are largely used to being able to skip or fast forward through ads they don't find immediately appealing."", '""So it\'s significant that they were able to interest a group of people who aren\'t predisposed to watching 30- or 60-second ad spots,"" she said. ""Now I\'m curious what will happen next. Because I\'m betting most of my students aren\'t E-Trade customers.""

Investors can now receive as much as a $1,000 deposit if they open an E-Trade non-retirement account.', 'To qualify, customers must transfer money in from outside E-Trade and Morgan Stanley.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Flowserve (NYSE:FLS) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Flowserve, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$406m ÷ (US$5.0b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Flowserve has an ROCE of 11%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Machinery industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve ', ""In the above chart we have measured Flowserve's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Flowserve."", ""Flowserve's ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 20% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""In summary, we're delighted to see that Flowserve has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. Since the total return from the stock has been almost flat over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here if the valuation looks good. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation."", ""If you'd like to know more about Flowserve, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA.', 'The overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum.', 'Earnings aren’t great, but then again, no one expected corporate profitability to be great. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.', 'With quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 9th, here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed.', 'First, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters.', 'The absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.', 'For the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 80.5% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 65% have beaten revenue estimates.', 'Second, companies are making good progress on the margins front.', 'The year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.', 'At the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance and others.', 'On the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Medical, Autos, Energy and Transportation sectors.', 'Third, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.', 'For the 64.5% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +21.5% on +6.4% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates.', 'Looking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.4% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.', 'The sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.', 'Please remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector, as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.5% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively.', 'What this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture, both negative as well as positive. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role.', 'Please note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.5% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.', 'Fourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.', 'Each of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.', 'Nvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues.', 'The Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.', 'Please note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.', 'Five, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.', 'Estimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.', 'For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Sector Back in Growth Mode', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

These stocks reward you with regular cash payments just for holding them. Moreover, dividends have accounted for the bulk of total returns from the U.S. stock market since 1900, a fact that often gets overlooked in today's growth-oriented market."", 'However, not all dividend stocks are table-pounding buys. Some are much better than others in terms of their quality, growth potential, and risk profile. The best dividend stocks are those that come from companies with a strong competitive advantage, reliable and increasing revenue, and healthy free cash flows.', 'Here are four dividend stocks that are proven wealth creators, making them top buys for the buy-and-hold crowd.', '1. Visa (NYSE: V) is a juggernaut in the digital payments space. As a result, the company has been able to generously reward its shareholders with a stunning dividend growth rate of 15.7% over the past five years.', 'This superb dividend growth rate also appears sustainable due to two key factors. First, Visa has a formidable competitive advantage in the digital payments industry. Second, it is a leader in a market that is growing by double digits annually right now.', ""So, while its yield of 0.75% may not be eye-catching, Visa's ultra-fast dividend growth rate and strong organic growth potential are solid reasons to buy its stock right now."", ""2. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is an oil and gas stalwart. Unlike Visa, ExxonMobil's five-year dividend growth rate of 1.77% isn't anything special. However, the oil and gas titan's stellar 3.73% annualized yield is more than twice that of the average stock listed on the S&P 500 index."", ""Plus, its smart cost-cutting strategies should keep its already robust free-cash-flow generation moving in the right direction, even with challenges from the industry's ongoing shift to renewables. In short, Exxon is a high-yield dividend stock that stands out as a reliable passive income play."", ""3. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is not just a big box retailer; it's a dividend powerhouse. The company has been rewarding its loyal shareholders with annual dividend increases since 1974, making it one of the most consistent dividend payers in the market. And that's not all."", 'Walmart is also planning to split its stock 3-for-1 later this month, which will make it more accessible and attractive to a wider range of investors. This move could boost its share price and deliver even more value to long-term holders.', ""Some people might overlook Walmart's dividend because of its low 1.35% yield and sluggish growth rate of 1.85% over the past five years. But they would be missing out on a great opportunity. Walmart's business is highly profitable and resilient, and its dividend is a proven commodity. In fact, the retail giant has markedly outperformed the broader market since 1990, thanks in no small part to its robust dividend program."", 'WMT Total Return Level data by YCharts', '4. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) arguably deserves more recognition as a dividend stock. The tech giant has transformed itself into a leader in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, boosting its revenue by a staggering 558% and its earnings by a mind-blowing 2,000% since it initiated its dividend program in 2003.', 'MSFT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts', ""Compared to those scorching metrics, though, Microsoft's meager 0.71% yield might seem insignificant, but don't let that fool you. Microsoft is a fantastic dividend growth stock."", 'To wit, the company has increased its dividend by an impressive 10.2% annually over the past five years, and its free cash flows have also doubled in that time.', ""That's an amazing combination that should appeal to dividend growth investors. So, don't overlook Microsoft as a mere large-cap growth stock; it's also an incredible dividend play."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

The company is expanding its sales footprint at a pace that makes it one of the fastest-expanding brands in the fast-food industry. Management plans to launch as many as 165 new locations in 2024, boosting the store base by 20%.', ""There are major trade-offs to investing in a company that's this early in its growth story, though. It's an especially risky proposition in the restaurant industry, which is known for weak profit margins and high rates of failure as consumers' tastes shift from one year to the next."", ""Most investors are better off focusing on established and profitable businesses. Let's take a look at why you might like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) more than the fast-expanding Dutch Bros business right now."", ""It's no exaggeration to say that Mickey D's has the fast-food marketing process all figured out. The company has been serving up its Big Mac sandwich for over 50 years and thrived through several recessions and many shifts in consumer tastes during that time."", ""You don't have to worry about a surprise sales decline seriously hurting this massive global business. In contrast with Dutch Bros and its projected $1.2 billion of revenue in 2024, most Wall Street pros see McDonald's generating $25 billion in the same period. A huge portion of that revenue comes from stable franchise fees, royalty fees, and rent income, too."", ""Profits aren't a concern as they might be with Dutch Bros. In fact, McDonald's is pushing its profitability to new highs toward a blazing 50% of sales (compared to Dutch Bros' 5%). That figure sat at 30% of sales just a decade ago, so McDonald's is still finding ways to squeeze more efficiency out of its global platform."", ""Choosing Starbucks over Dutch Bros isn't going to force you into the growth compromises that you might expect when purchasing an established, mature business. The coffee titan is expanding more quickly at its existing locations right now, after all, having boosted same-store sales by 5% last quarter, compared to Dutch Bros' 4% rate. It has plenty of room to add to its huge store base, as well, despite having blanketed most metro markets with its cafes."", ""Starbucks is pushing into more rural locations, for example, with help from its expanding drive-thru presence. Toss in a thriving international business, and you've got some excellent growth avenues for the coming years. The chain added 550 locations in the last quarter to push its total to just below 39,000."", ""You might be tempted to prefer Dutch Bros, given its far smaller sales base of below 900 locations spread across 16 states. Reaching even a fraction of Starbucks' U.S. presence in a decade would translate into massive growth."", ""But the market leader is clearly the less risky choice, both for its large and stable sales base and caffeinated growth potential.

Improved fundamentals, the resolution of a major issue, or merely an improvement in investor sentiment can result in a big re-rating to the upside within a reasonable time frame.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'The following seven undervalued stocks to buy all fit within this category. Each one has fallen by 25% or more from its 52-week high, currently trades at a low or reasonable valuation, and could experience a faster-than-expected recovery.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Last month, an accounting scandal knocked Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) to rock-bottom prices. Shares in the agribusiness giant have started to recover, as investors look into the details of the scandal, and determine that the market’s initial response may have been an overreaction.', 'With the alleged accounting irregularities occurring within a business unit making up less than 10% of the company’s overall revenue, the potential impact of this scandal may be minimal. That’s not to say ADM stock will quickly return to pre-scandal prices immediately, but a steady climb back to prior levels may happen in the months ahead.', 'Beyond recovering from this scandal, a rebound in global food demand/prices will likely help agribusiness stocks like Archer-Daniels-Midland bounce back as well. Trading for just 8 times forward earnings, and with a 3.6% dividend to boot, joining the crowd of contrarian investors snapping up ADM right now could prove profitable.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) may be one of the best undervalued stocks to buy in the pharmaceuticals sector. After sinking more than 35% from its 52-week high, shares in this big pharma firm trade for only 6.6 times earnings.', 'BMY stock also has a forward dividend yield of 4.91%. Sure, on the surface, Bristol-Myers Squibb may seem like a potential value trap. Forecasts call for negative earnings growth this year. The company has also extended its sales ramp-up timeline for new drug products that are needed to replace existing blockbuster drugs experiencing declining sales due to generic competition.', 'Still, with negative sentiment so heavily priced-in, it may not take much to drive a big partial recovery for BMY. Even the potential upside from a partial rebound could exceed downside risk, given the extent in which this pharma stock has been discounted by the market.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Since early 2023, shares in toy and game giant Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) have attempted to make a recovery. But, after experiencing a strong rebound between March and September of last year, the stock has since fallen back by around 31.5%. Chalk this up to uncertainty about Hasbro’s near-term operating performance.', 'However, as I argued when last writing about HAS stock in December, the company’s turnaround efforts could prove successful, shifting sentiment from bearish back to bullish. Turnaround plans have included the sale of non-core businesses to raise cash for de-leveraging purposes. Hasbro has also made efforts to reduce costs through layoffs.', 'If these efforts lead to stronger earnings in the quarters ahead, the stock (at around $50 per share today) could swing back to its 52-week high of $73.58 per share, or even higher. While waiting for the turnaround, you can collect HAS’s 5.72% dividend.', 'Source: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com', 'Admittedly, it may seem odd to include Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) in the “undervalued stocks” category. After all, shares in this China-based electric vehicle (EV) maker trade for 23.3 times forward earnings. Yet given how many of Li’s early-stage competitors, like Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) currently operate at a loss, this valuation appears more-than-reasonable.', 'The valuation of LI stock also appears more-than-reasonable, when you consider the extent in which Li’s earnings could grow in 2024. Consensus calls for earnings growth of around 40.8%, but the high end of forecasts call for earnings to nearly double, from $1.25 to $2.45 per share.', 'While not guaranteed, Li’s strong January 2024 delivery numbers – up 105.8% year-over-year – suggest that achieving such high levels of growth this year is very possible. In turn, this could help LI – down 38% from its 52-week high – make a strong recovery this year.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock', 'Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is another value stock that could experience a rapid recovery. In fact, shares in the media conglomerate could reach higher price far sooner than many of the other stocks discussed above and below.', 'Why? In Wall Street parlance, Paramount Global is “in play.” Media mogul Byron Allen recently made a $14.3 billion bid for the whole company. Not all of Allen’s past media takeover bids have resulted in deals. However, Allen could end up with portions of the company, such as its television assets.', 'Other strategic buyers are interested, including Skydance Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD). Paramount has formed an independent committee to assess possible strategic alternatives like a sale. The Redstone family, who control the company, appears interested in making a deal. If you are interested in taking a speculative position in a potential takeover stock, PARA is one such opportunity.', 'Source: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com', 'Look up The Children’s Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) on a stock screener, and at first it may not seem like it’s one of the undervalued stocks. Based on trailing earnings, shares in this children’s apparel retailer are not cheap. The company has reported heavy losses over the past twelve months.', 'However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator bullish on PLCE stock recently pointed out, The Children’s Place remains on track to reduce debt and make big improvements in profitability. This gives credence to sell-side earnings forecasts, which call for PLCE’s earnings to go from negative 49 cents last fiscal year ending January 2024 to $2.54 per share this fiscal year ending January 2025.', 'Achieving such an earnings recovery will undoubtedly result in a recovery for The Children’s Place shares. At $22 per share today, the stock trades at less than half of its 52-week high of $47.26 per share.', 'Source: FOTOGRIN / Shutterstock.com', 'RCI Hospitality Holdings (NASDAQ:RICK) is a publicly-traded gentlemen’s club operator. Yet while RCI’s risqué business alone may be enticing, what’s especially appealing to value investors is the stock’s low valuation and potentially-oversold status.', 'RICK stock currently trades for just 12.75 times earnings, and has fallen by nearly 32% from its 52-week high. The recent U.S. economic challenges have weighed on RCI’s operating performance. This explains why shares have tumbled over the past year.', 'However, as I argued last month, a post-slowdown recovery may lead to an earnings and stock price rebound. Cooling inflation and lower interest rates may enable RCI to hit forecasts calling for earnings of $6.38 per share next fiscal year ending September 2025. Hitting this level of earnings, coupled with a re-rating to the upside could send this stock – in the mid-$60s per share today – up to over $100 per share.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

However, volatility has been heightened for a majority of the decade. Over the previous four years, Wall Street's major stock indexes have bounced between bear and bull markets in successive years."", 'When volatility and uncertainty rule the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to seek out the safety of time-tested and outperforming industry leaders. A perfect example over the past decade has been the ""FAANG stocks."" But since the midpoint of 2021, companies enacting stock splits have been especially popular.', 'A ""stock split"" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to change both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a company\'s share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse-stock split).', ""Although some companies that have enacted reverse splits have gone on to deliver big-time gains to their shareholders, the bulk of investors' interest in stock-split stocks lies with those conducting forward splits."", ""For more than a year, I've been highlighting nine of the most high-profile and widely owned businesses to have completed forward splits since July 2021. In chronological order, this includes:"", 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split in 2021.', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split in 2022.', 'DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split in 2022.', 'Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split in 2022.', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split in 2022.', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split in 2022.', 'Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split in 2022.', 'Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split in 2023.', 'Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split in 2023.', 'Aside from the similarity of completing a forward-stock split and handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 over long periods, these nine former stock-split stocks all bring easily identifiable competitive advantages and/or seemingly untouchable moats to the table.', ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of the share of GPUs in use in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated data centers this year."", ""Amazon's online marketplace brings in about 40% of online retail sales in the U.S., while Amazon Web Services is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services provider."", 'DexCom is a top-two player in continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) and has developed numerous generations of CGMs for diabetics.', 'Shopify is the leading provider of e-commerce software platforms in the United States, as of 2023.', ""Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share in January, while Google Cloud is the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure services share."", ""Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV producer that's generating a recurring profit."", 'Palo Alto Networks is one of the largest next-generation firewall solutions providers in the cybersecurity space.', 'Monster Beverage is the second-leading provider of energy drinks in the U.S., with a 30% share in 2023.', 'Novo Nordisk is a dominant player in the global insulin market, as well as a key innovator of injectable GLP-1 drugs, which have induced weight loss in patients.', 'More importantly, among these nine former stock-split stocks are two companies that appear ripe for yet another split.', ""Out of the nine high-profile stock-split stocks over the past two-and-a-half years, none has a more compelling case to conduct yet another split than semiconductor stock Nvidia. When Nvidia enacted its 4-for-1 split in July 2021, its share price was at roughly $750. Last week, Nvidia's stock hit a fresh (split-adjusted) all-time high of just over $700 per share."", ""As noted, artificial intelligence is the driving force behind Nvidia's surging sales and profits. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs have been the clear top choice by businesses looking to incorporate AI solutions and generative AI into their growth strategies."", ""What's been particularly helpful for Nvidia is that demand for AI-fueled GPUs has handily outstripped the supply of these chips. Though Nvidia would probably love to sell more of its A100 and H100 chips, this scarcity has sent the price for existing AI-GPUs into the stratosphere. Whereas Nvidia's cost of revenue has only modestly moved higher, data center sales should have more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (which ended in late January)."", ""It's also worth pointing out that leading chip-fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is in the process of dramatically increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity. CoWoS is a practical necessity in high-compute data centers given the need to incorporate high-bandwidth memory. Thus, Taiwan Semi's actions should help Nvidia meaningfully ramp production in the current calendar year."", ""Nevertheless, red flags remain with Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence stock -- and not even a potential stock split will whisk them away."", ""Nvidia is beginning to see competition take shape both externally and internally. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year, while Intel unveiled its Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 generative AI software chip in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's top revenue customers, Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are in the process of developing AI chips of their own to lessen their reliance on Nvidia."", 'To boot, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble. The fear of missing out (better known as ""FOMO"") has a tendency to lift investor expectations well ahead of tangible demand with next-big-thing trends. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception.', 'The other former stock-split stock that appears ready for round two is none other than cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks. When Palo Alto effected its 3-for-1 forward split in mid-September 2022, its share price was near $550. In the 17 months since conducting its split, shares of the company have more than doubled and are approaching $370.', ""The beauty of cybersecurity is that it's become nothing short of a basic necessity for businesses with an online or cloud-based presence. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing, businesses with an online or cloud presence need cybersecurity solutions to protect their data and that of their customers from hackers and robots that don't take a day off."", ""The catalyst that's really helped power Palo Alto Networks' gains over the past five years is its purposeful shift away from physical firewall products and toward cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. By the end of fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends July 31), less than 62% of Palo Alto's net sales were traced back to subscriptions and support. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31, 2023), nearly 82% of its sales derived from subscriptions and support."", ""A cloud-based SaaS operating model is genius for a number of reasons. First, the incorporation of AI and machine learning allows Palo Alto's solutions to be nimbler and more responsive than on-premises security solutions. A subscription-based model also helps with customer retention and can lead to more consistent payouts from clients throughout the year, relative to physical firewall products. And third, a cloud-based SaaS model generates considerably juicier margins than selling physical firewall products."", ""Add-on sales are another reason Palo Alto Networks has been virtually unstoppable. The company's high-margin Prisma Cloud platform saw the number of customers purchasing five or more cloud modules grow by a jaw-dropping 166% in the fiscal first quarter, compared to the prior-year period. Palo Alto is landing bigger clients, and it's having success getting many of its larger clients to progressively spend more."", ""Although Palo Alto Networks' stock is historically pricey, average annual earnings growth of at least 20% is a real possibility through the end of the decade, if not well beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

For one thing, just the name OTC should ring some alarm bells. This designation means that these securities don’t trade on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Instead, they trade via broker-dealer networks. And not all stock platforms support what’s otherwise known as the pink sheets.', 'Second, many investors are shocked to discover the administrative costs tied to OTC stocks. Yes, many of these securities are “cheap,” trading hands at unit prices well below a buck. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s cheap to you. Wide bid-ask spreads may mean that your holdings may have to rise significantly higher to be net profitable. Also, even if you are profitable, low trading volume could mean a long time to find a buyer.', 'At the same time, OTC stocks or otherwise highly speculative shares can fly higher. Some examples include the following:', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST): In 1997, you could have had MNST for just two cents.', 'Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): On a split-adjusted basis, you could have bought AAPL for 10 cents in December 1980.', 'Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD): Back in June 2015, AMD traded for below $2.', 'Of course, there are way more failures than successes. But if you want to go for gold, below are the OTC stocks to consider.', 'Source: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com', 'A Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had a rough outing in 2023. Mainly, that’s due to the challenging circumstances surrounding the Chinese economy. And if a CNN report proves correct, 2024 could be an even rougher outing. Still, Tencent’s expansionary ambitions reach beyond its home nation. With eyes on Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and several other international regions, Tencent could be interesting for speculators.', 'To be sure, with a market capitalization of around $337.5 billion, TCEHY doesn’t exactly rate as one of the typical OTC stocks. However, it’s a great confidence booster because it’s in some ways the best of both worlds: offering tremendous upside potential while also being a technology stalwart in its home nation.', 'Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $49.56 average price target. That implies an upside potential of over 40%. What’s more, the high-side target hits $61.13, possibly delivering growth of over 73%. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, shares trade at only 13.06X forward earnings, below the interactive media sector’s median value of 21.19X.', 'Source: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving on to another Chinese company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) presents a unique proposition. First, it’s a major automotive enterprise specializing in electric vehicles, yet it technically ranks among the OTC stocks. Second, Warren Buffett – who is best known for investing in reliable blue chips – owns BYD via Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). To be fair, Buffett has been reducing his exposure but he still owns a sizable amount.', 'Despite the seemingly contradictory tone, investors may want to consider adding BYDDF to their portfolio. Yeah, it’s one of the OTC stocks and yes, the Chinese economy looks rather putrid if I’m being honest. However, with EVs becoming increasingly commoditized, guess who’s going to win that battle? There’s just no way that western nations can compete with their higher labor costs.', 'Also, investors should consider another element: demand. European politicians may want to reduce the flood of Chinese EVs. But their constituents? They love ‘em. So do analysts, who rate BYDDF a consensus strong buy with a $36.03 price target. That implies 63% upside potential.', 'Source: buffaloboy / Shutterstock.com', 'Yet one more Chinese company to discuss and then we’ll get into the really wild OTC stocks. A designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) is a cynical play. For example, beyond its consumer electronics business, it’s also involved in the EV space. Recently, the company launched its first electric-powered vehicle, which might have caught the eyes of some lawyers.', 'I’m joking there, but seriously, the Xiaomi SU7 looks like it ripped off the design of a particular German brand. But if the consumers who love BYD offer any clues, the SU7 should be a hit. Apparently, it has the performance (up to 664 horsepower) and the longevity to better the top players in the ecosystem. And even if you didn’t like the EV pivot, Xiaomi should win in consumer electronics.', 'Frankly, with smart devices becoming so commoditized, people may start looking to price more often than brand. If so, XIACF has a clear pathway to robust shareholder profits. Analysts agree, rating the stock a unanimous strong buy with a $2.66 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Okay, let’s buckle up for some serious OTC stocks and by that, I mean high risk, high reward. First, Quisitive Technology Solutions (OTCMKTS:QUISF) bills itself as a premier global Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partner that harnesses its cloud platforms and complete technologies to generate transformational impact for midsize and enterprise-level customers. It’s an intriguing idea because, at one point, shares closed at $1.54 on a weekly average basis.', 'Currently, QUISF trades hands at only 22 cents. And you should note that over the past 52 weeks, it lost more than 53% of its equity value. Further, according to the security’s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, it prints a double bottom breakdown. According to StockCharts.com’s educational section, this pattern is a bearish signal. That said, the pattern should also be viewed in a broader context due to possible whipsaw effects.', 'And what is that context? Basically, the broader cloud computing market could be worth $2.43 trillion by 2030. Quisitive just needs to take a bite out of this market to potentially drive higher. Analysts seem to be on the same page, pegging the average price target at 49 cents.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'As a fan of the uranium energy space, I perked up when I came across this opportunity hidden among OTC stocks. As a uranium extraction specialist, Peninsula Energy (OTCMKTS:PENMF) addresses a critical supply shortage that recently sprouted. According to The Wall Street Journal, last month, uranium prices jumped to a 16-year high after one of the world’s largest producers – Kazakhstan’s state-owned company Kazatomprom – warned of production target shortfalls.', 'With uranium supplies uncertain for the next two years, several uranium players have skyrocketed. One of the exceptions is PENMF. In the trailing one-year period, the security declined by 8%. That said, it is up 15% on a year-to-date basis but that’s a modest performance compared to exchange-listed uranium specialists.', 'Still, as far as OTC stocks are concerned, Peninsula could be intriguing because of geopolitical considerations. Basically, it features 100% ownership of the Lance Project, which is one of the largest uranium projects in the U.S.', 'Better yet, analysts expect great things, pegging shares a moderate buy with a 17-cent target. That implies almost 85% upside potential, with the high-side target landing at 22 cents.', 'Source: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Saturn Oil & Gas (OTCMKTS:OILSF) is a resource company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of petroleum and natural gas resource despoits in Western Canada. Further, the company’s current focus is to advance the exploration and development of its oil and gas properties in Alberta and Saskatchewan.', 'As an upstream player in the hydrocarbon space, Saturn might not seem particularly relevant. Late last year, many oil-producing nations agreed to cut production in a bid to bolster prices. However, that effort did not succeed. Also, Reuters recently reported that rising U.S. oil production has frustrated the aforementioned oil producers. So, it seems OILSF could be one of the losing OTC stocks.', 'However, the blowout January jobs report suggests that we shouldn’t quite give up on black gold just yet. More people with jobs should translate to more resource consumption. And to be blunt, renewable energy just won’t be enough to feed the growing demand profile.

Please make a decision based on your own due diligence and a sober reflection of your risk tolerance. This is a security that has already lost almost 28% YTD and is likely subject to severe market turbulence.', 'With the caveats out of the way, Vivos is engaged in the development of its yttrium-90-based brachytherapy device, RadioGel, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, brachytherapy is a radiation treatment that is given directly into the patient’s body. Typically, the radiation is deployed using tiny devices such as wires, seeds, or rods filled with radioactive materials.', 'Where Vivos distinguishes itself is that RadioGel utilizes an injectable particle-gel, which delivers a very high local radiation dose. More broadly, RDGL entices speculators because the underlying industry is still in its early innings, worth $907.76 million in 2022.', 'As for a price target, it’s difficult to say as no analyst currently covers RDGL.

Since the green flag waved in January 2020, the three major stock indexes -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite -- have teetered back and forth between bear and bull markets in successive years. It's a solid reminder of just how unpredictable the stock market can be over short time frames."", ""When volatility picks up is precisely when investors usually seek out the safety of time-tested, industry-leading outperformers. In other words, it's precisely why the FAANG stocks have crushed the broader market over the trailing decade."", 'When I say ""FAANG stocks,"" I\'m talking about:', 'Facebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)', 'Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'What these five companies offer investors is seemingly insurmountable competitive advantages.', ""Meta Platforms is the parent behind the world's top social media assets. Collectively, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are four of the most downloaded apps globally and were responsible for luring nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter."", ""Apple has been a dominant domestic player in the smartphone arena since introducing the iPhone. It's also in the process of transforming itself into a services-focused company. The icing on the cake is that Apple's share repurchase program is unrivaled -- over $600 billion worth of buybacks since initiating a repurchase program in 2013."", ""Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brought in nearly $0.40 of every $1 in U.S. online retail sales in 2022, according to an estimate from Insider Intelligence. Further, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, with an estimated 31% share, per tech-analysis firm Canalys."", 'Netflix is the domestic and international streaming share leader. Additionally, no streaming service has come remotely close to its expansive library of original content.', ""Alphabet's Google was responsible for 91.5% of global internet search share in January. It's also the parent of streaming service YouTube, the second-most-visited social site behind Facebook; and Google Cloud, the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider worldwide by market share."", 'Despite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlook for each FAANG stock differs greatly. In February, one historically inexpensive FAANG stock stands head and shoulders above its peers as a phenomenal buy, while another highflier is set to face a mountain of potential headwinds.', ""Out of the five longtime outperformers listed above, it's Google, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo parent Alphabet that stands out as the smartest buy in the shortest month of the year."", ""To be fair, even the best stocks that look like no-brainer buys face potential headwinds. For Alphabet, the biggest concern is the likelihood that the U.S. will fall into a recession at some point this year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's leading recession probability indicator, along with an assortment of money-based metrics, suggest that a downturn is likely. Since Alphabet generates a majority of its revenue from advertising, the expectation would be for a slowdown in its growth and profits if a recession materializes."", 'However, there are two sides to this coin -- and it most definitely favors investors who are patient. Even though recessions are a normal, inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 downturns that have occurred since the end of World War II lasted 12 months. By comparison, almost every economic expansion since September 1945 has endured for multiple years. Ad-driven businesses with sustainable competitive advantages are perfectly positioned to thrive over long periods.', ""Google's absolutely dominant position as the world's leading search engine isn't going to change anytime soon. It's been almost nine years since Google last held less than a 90% monthly share of worldwide search, based on data from GlobalStats. This suggests it'll have little issue maintaining exceptional pricing power and increasing its operating cash flow over time."", ""But most investors (including myself) are more excited about what Alphabet's ancillary operating segments have to offer. For instance, daily views of YouTube Shorts (short-form videos typically lasting less than a minute) have grown by more than a factor of eight since 2021. This should help YouTube's ad-pricing power and encourage users to sign up for high-margin subscriptions."", ""Perhaps even more exciting is Alphabet's rapidly growing cloud segment. Following years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating profit in 2023. Not only is enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, but the margins associated with cloud services are usually considerably higher than those associated with advertising. As Google Cloud grows into a larger share of net sales, expect Alphabet's operating cash flow to expand even faster."", 'Lastly, Alphabet is cheap. Its forward-year earnings multiple of 19 is lower than the benchmark S&P 500, while its multiple of 13.4x consensus cash flow in 2025 is roughly 26% below its average cash-flow multiple over the trailing five years.', 'Although the FAANG stocks have been virtually unstoppable for more than a decade, not all five components are worth buying. In February, the highflier worth avoiding is none other than streaming service Netflix.', ""Just as Alphabet has headwinds as a stock to buy, Netflix has possible catalysts as a stock I'd suggest avoiding. The single biggest driver for Netflix is that its vast content library affords it substantial subscription pricing power. Historically, Netflix has lost very few customers when it's raised its monthly subscription prices. It also doesn't hurt that the company is offering more streaming options than ever, including the addition of an ad-supported tier."", ""Additionally, Netflix's cash flow needle is moving in the right direction. Netflix generated $6.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) last year, more than quadrupling the $1.6 billion in FCF from 2022. Significant growth in cash flow has allowed Netflix to aggressively repurchase its stock -- 5.5 million shares bought back during the fourth quarter for roughly $2.5 billion. A reduced outstanding share count for steadily profitable companies can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Unfortunately, it's not all good news for Netflix."", 'The obvious issue is that competition for streaming services has been heating up. Walt Disney, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros. Discovery have all quickly grown their respective subscriber bases. These are brand-name media companies that have traditionally had profitable legacy TV segments. In other words, they have plenty of capital to endure temporary losses as they build out their streaming segments.', ""However, streaming losses for Netflix's competitors may not continue much longer. Disney anticipates its streaming segment will turn the corner to recurring profitability by the end of its current fiscal year (i.e., by the end of September 2024). Meanwhile, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery should see notably smaller losses from streaming in the new year as advertising revenue perks up, cost-cutting takes shape, and subscription prices increase."", ""Another reason to cast doubt on Netflix is the company's decision to approve a sizable $10 billion share repurchase program in October. Though buybacks are shareholder-friendly, large repurchase programs are typically reserved for mature businesses or those running out of innovative ideas. An acceleration of buybacks could signal that Netflix is struggling to find new and innovative ways to move the needle, which would be particularly worrisome given its valuation."", ""Lastly, there's the company's premium valuation. Shares of Netflix are currently priced at approximately 27x forward-year earnings and 26x forward-year cash flow. It's the priciest FAANG stock relative to cash flow, which makes it an easy stock to avoid for the foreseeable future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

This strong positioning provides S&P Global with an economic moat around its business, making it an excellent blue chip stock with an attractive risk-reward profile."", ""One sign of S&P Global's incredible stability is its long history of raising dividend payments. The company recently increased its payout by 1.1%, marking the 51st consecutive year the agency has raised its dividend."", ""Now, S&P Global is by no means an impressive dividend stock. After all, its annual dividend yield is 0.8%, below the S&P 500 index's dividend yield of 1.3%. However, when you combine S&P Global's dividend with its stock price appreciation, you'll see the blue chip stock's impressive history of outperformance."", ""Over the last decade, S&P Global stock has delivered a total return (which includes reinvested dividends) of 20.6% annually, beating the S&P 500's annual return of 12.8%. If you go back through the past three decades, the stock has returned 16.4% annually vs. the S&P 500's 10.1% return."", ""These stellar returns came as S&P Global and other credit ratings agencies faced criticism for their role in the subprime mortgage crisis that came to a head in 2008, along with the 2011 downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Its results are a testament to S&P Global's robust economic moat and ability to grow alongside the economy while riding out challenging times."", ""On the surface, S&P Global stock looks quite expensive, with its 59.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, the agency's earnings have been depressed due to reduced debt issuance by companies. As interest rates began rising along with market volatility in 2022, companies held off on debt issuance until there was more certainty about where rates would end up in the longer term."", 'However, S&P Global could soon benefit from tailwinds to its business. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are pricing in five interest rate cuts by the end of this year. If rates fall during the year, the lower interest rates could entice companies waiting on the sidelines to issue debt.', 'In an interview with Reuters, Blair Shwedo, head of U.S. sales and trading at U.S. Bank (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), said, ""This should be an extremely welcome environment for corporate issuance."" Early signs show a pickup in bond issuance to start the year. According to SIFMA, corporate bond issuance in January increased 27% year over year.', 'S&P Global has a robust advantage in the credit rating industry, and its analytics business can help smooth out cash flow over time, even when its rating business slows down. Analysts expect earnings to bounce back this year, and the stock trades around a reasonable one-year forward P/E ratio of 28.', 'Given its long track record of success across economic cycles and potential tailwinds from a pickup in debt issuance, S&P Global is an excellent stock that investors can confidently buy today and hold long-term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in S&P Global right now?', 'Before you buy stock in S&P Global, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P Global wasn’t one of them.

As you work toward your short-term and long-term financial goals, investing is one of many ways you can grow wealth with time."", 'Dividend stocks can help you build your passive income streams, because you can benefit not just from the share price performance of the business, but from regular (usually quarterly) dividend distributions. There are dividend stocks you can buy across a range of industries, from consumer goods to healthcare to real estate.', ""When you're looking at dividend stocks, a favorable yield isn't the only factor you should evaluate. In addition to ensuring you choose dividend stocks that are backed by solid businesses and moderate payout ratios, you should also make sure the company has a solid history of paying its dividend through economic thick and thin, and raising it with the passage of time."", ""It's always a good time to invest in brilliant passive income stocks. Here are two such fantastic dividend payers you'll want to consider for your portfolio."", ""AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) yields 3.55% for investors at the time of this writing, above the average payout of the stock trading on the S&P 500 (around 1.5%). Because the company is a spin-off of healthcare giant Abbott, it carries its former parent company's storied dividend track record with it, which happens to be 52 consecutive years of dividend increases."", 'Since AbbVie spun off from Abbott over a decade ago, it has raised its dividend every single year. In the trailing 10-year period, that dividend has risen by roughly 270%. The stock has delivered a total return of 452% to faithful shareholders over the past decade as well.', 'The company is currently dealing with the financial effects of loss of patent exclusivity on its long-term blockbuster arthritis drug Humira -- a fact that has driven revenue and profits down. But AbbVie has plenty of other top-selling products in its arsenal. It also has potential blockbuster products in its pipeline that can stem the tide in the years ahead. The company still reported revenue of $54 billion in the full-year 2023, and profits just shy of $5 billion, helped by an 18% increase in revenue from its neuroscience products portfolio.', ""AbbVie also boasts other heavy-hitters like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat numerous ailments, including plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Rinvoq is a type of drug called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It treats a variety of inflammatory disorders, including psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis. These drugs have years of patent exclusivity left in them, and management previously said that both were expected to surpass the sales peak of Humira. This is no small feat, considering Humira was the world's top-selling drug for years and raked in $21 billion in 2022 alone. Sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq rose by respective amounts of 50% and 57% in 2023 from 2022, reaching a combined sales total of $11.7 billion in the 12-month period."", ""The company also recently announced two key acquisitions that should add to its balance sheet potential in the years ahead. One is of ImmunoGen, a biotech company that makes antibody-drug conjugates to treat various cancers. The acquisition will add ImmunoGen's ovarian cancer drug Elahere to AbbVie's oncology portfolio. This product is on track to generate sales of approximately $1.4 billion before the end of the decade, according to GlobalData."", ""The other big upcoming acquisition for AbbVie is of Cerevel Therapeutics, which will add a range of new candidates to its portfolio across disease areas, including mood disorders and Parkinson's. While AbbVie is in a transition period right now as it balances the effect of Humira sales declines with existing and emerging blockbusters, the business still looks like a solid buy-and-hold investment. The company had roughly $14 billion in cash on hand at last record. That dividend is icing on the cake for the long-term investor."", 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is another mainstay healthcare business with an incredible history of successively maintaining and raising its dividend.

It spun off its consumer health business into a new publicly traded company called Kenvue last year. The move accomplished a few goals for Johnson & Johnson.', 'While the consumer health business was known for household name brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine, margins are low and growth had lagged significantly behind its pharmaceutical and medical device segments. The spinoff left Johnson & Johnson with a substantial 9.5% equity stake, plus a cash windfall of $13 billion.', ""Johnson & Johnson reported total sales of around $85 billion in the full-year 2023, a 6.5% increase from the prior year. The company also brought in net income of $13 billion, which was down from 2022, but still not a figure to scoff at. Adjusted net earnings for the 12-month period came in at $25 billion, a 6.8% year-over-year increase. Broken down by segment, net sales in Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine business rose 4.2% from 2022, while MedTech sales rose 10.8% from 2022."", ""With a portfolio of top-selling drugs as well as a lineup of emerging medicines in disease areas ranging from inflammatory disorders to oncology, this tried-and-true business can deliver steady growth to investors for years to come.

In fact, it surged the highest during COVID-19. Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE), crossed the $100 billion mark in annual revenue. The surge in revenue was due to the massive haul from its COVID-19 products.

Moreover, living in this rapidly evolving time, uncertainty surrounding life has increased manifold. Geopolitical strife is a harsh reality, disrupting people all around the globe. In addition, economic upheavals witnessed, for instance, in the form of 2008 financial crisis as well as the recent Covid-19 pandemic, bears evidence to the damage that unpredictability can cause. To cope with these new challenges, people around the world have recognized the significance of hedging themselves through various means, including attaining second citizenship. In 2021, 2.1% of people (1.26 million) across England and Wales were found to have multiple citizenship. Overall in Europe, there was a 14% increase in the number of citizens residing in the EU for the year 2021. The United States has also been welcoming immigrants and, over the last decade alone, saw approximately 7.7 million citizens have been naturalized into the country.', 'As of 2020 data, about 76% of countries allow dual citizenship. While the acceptance for this phenomenon has worldwide implications, some countries were seen to accept it faster (Americas and Oceania) than others (Asia and Africa). 91% companies in America and 93% in Oceania have accepted dual citizenship. They are followed by Europe (80%), Africa (70%), and Asia (65%). Now, the focus is not only on obtaining a second passport but also on finding the fastest and easiest countries to get citizenship.', 'As the rejection of “one citizenship one passport” paradigm took root, the recognition of dual citizenship spurred, initiating policy reforms in various countries. However, it is important to note a difference between dual citizenship and second citizenship. With dual citizenship, an individual can hold passports from two countries and both nations officially acknowledge the rights and obligations of that individual. On the other hand, with second citizenship, an individual can possess multiple passports but each country recognizes the person solely as its citizen. For a complete analysis of dual citizenship, consult our article on Dual Citizenship Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements.', ""Each of us, with our distinct needs and perceptions, approaches the selection of countries for second citizenship based on our individual criteria. While tailoring our choices to personal preferences is a sound strategy, caution is paramount when making such significant decisions. It is crucial, for instance, to discern between dual citizenship and second citizenship. Although tolerance for dual citizenship has become more common, some countries still reject this privilege, and pursuing it may lead to the cancellation of one's original citizenship."", 'In general, there are several ways to acquire citizenship, including options such as citizenship by birth, descent, naturalization, marriage, and citizenship through investment. Depending on individual circumstances and preferences, one form of citizenship might prove to be the fastest and easiest route for obtaining a second citizenship. However, not all countries allow citizenship through all these options, and some options may not be feasible for certain individuals. For example, while citizenship through investment programs has been associated with quick acquisition, they often require a substantial initial investment, which may not be viable for the majority of people. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine such programs, considering the type and amount of investment involved, before opting for this fast-track approach. In conclusion, when deciding on the fastest or easiest countries for citizenship, making an informed and individual centric decision is necessary.', 'One of the prominent figures associated with second citizenship through naturalization is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc.

Born to German parents, Thiel arrived in US at the age of one, and through hard work became a highly successful entrepreneur. Beginning with PayPal Holdings Inc.

To be sure, revenue still heads higher nearly every quarter, but it's at a pace that's far lower than the market had grown to expect. A slowdown in growth has forced the share price lower, from $300 to $60 over just two years. The slide in share price also came with a collapse in valuation multiples."", 'However, recent news suggests that a new runway for growth could be right around the corner, providing a strong investment case for growth and value investors alike.', ""To understand PayPal's latest fall from grace, it's important to understand why the stock skyrocketed to such heights in the first place."", 'In early 2002, PayPal stock went public through an initial public offering (IPO). Before the year was through, the company was acquired by eBay. It was a great match. PayPal needed online shoppers to adopt its platform to grow. Meanwhile, in the early days of digital commerce, eBay required a proven, trusted payment processor to convince consumers that buying goods and services online could be safe and reliable. By linking each business, eBay and PayPal provided each other with paved runways for growth.', ""After years of fruitful synergy, eBay decided to spin off PayPal, making it an independent company. The true growth potential of PayPal was finally unleashed. Management soon moved into high-growth verticals like micropayments and international transfers. The company went on a buying spree, purchasing Honey, a coupon discovery browser plug-in, for $4 billion in 2020, while taking full ownership over China's GoPay app that same year. In 2020 alone, PayPal shares more than doubled in value."", ""The separation of eBay and PayPal -- the catalyst behind the company's newfound growth -- eventually became a headwind. In 2021, eBay didn't renew a five-year contract that made PayPal its payment processor. PayPal's total payment volumes continued to increase, but the loss of eBay as a reliable means to reach customers provided a significant growth headwind. That, combined with a slowdown in online spending after pandemic closures reversed, caused the share price to collapse."", ""Following PayPal's meteoric collapse, shares look like a bargain for the first time in years. The stock trades at under 19 times earnings, its cheapest multiple ever. The S&P 500 index, for comparison, trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 23."", ""PayPal shares, once a ticket to rapid growth, are now cheaper than the market. Investors just aren't willing to believe in PayPal's long-term growth prospects, but there's reason to believe a turnaround could be just around the corner."", ""On Jan. 25, PayPal's management team unveiled six new features that it believes can reinvigorate the company's slumping growth. The market responded with cautious optimism, but there's reason to believe one feature, in particular, will chart the company's next growth runway."", ""There's no doubt that e-commerce sales in general will continue to rise in the years to come. In 2024, for example, e-commerce retail sales are expected to grow by 9.4%. That's higher than PayPal's revenue growth in recent quarters. All PayPal needs to do is figure out how to grow alongside its core market, ideally gaining market share along the way. Its new Fastlane service could be the killer feature that unlocks this opportunity."", 'Currently in the pilot phase, Fastlane promises to allow online merchants to convert shoppers into buyers faster, with higher conversion rates. According to PayPal, there would be ""no username or password to remember, no personal info to update, no need to share a credit card with businesses all over the web."" With over 400 million active users, PayPal can easily recognize a huge number of digital shoppers. By integrating Fastlane, merchants can allow shoppers to checkout without entering any additional information. PayPal believes it can reduce checkout time by almost 40%, with plans to bring the platform to millions of merchants upon launch.', 'Why is Fastlane such a killer feature? Across the highly competitive e-commerce world, efficiencies matter. Amazon once estimated that a one-second increase in page load speeds would cost it $1.6 billion in annual sales. Every friction point, no matter how small, can cause a shopper to click elsewhere, abandoning a potential purchase.', 'Merchants like eBay ditched PayPal because it could easily replicate the payment aspect of the business, keeping the processing fees for itself. PayPal now needs to offer more than just a payment option for merchants, and Fastlane appears to be the first of many innovations that could finally persuade merchants to prefer PayPal once again.

The intense spotlight has made a market darling out of IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a pure-play quantum computing company. Even after a 45% price drop from its yearly highs last summer, the stock has more than doubled over the last year and trades at a mind-blowing 113 times sales.', ""IonQ may have a stellar long-term future ahead, but it's still a highly speculative investment. It runs a deeply unprofitable business model with more question marks than exclamation points, and the company has yet to ship a functioning system. The nascent industry looks risky in this early stage, and IonQ doesn't have a Plan B ready in case its research or system-building efforts go wrong. Therefore, I'd rather look at more stable alternatives in the field of quantum computing."", 'On that note, here are three companies dabbling in quantum computing as a side gig to far more robust core businesses. This way, you can gain exposure to this cutting-edge technology while also enjoying the benefits of a diversified and proven business platform.', ""Let's start with semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Many investors see quantum computing as a serious threat to old-school digital computers, but Chipzilla is facing the challenge head-on. The company has been researching quantum computing since 2015 and shipped its Tunnel Falls quantum system with 12 qubits (quantum computing units) to research partners last year."", 'Broader business model: Intel, a leading semiconductor company, is expanding into quantum computing through its research and development initiatives. Its quantum efforts are backed by its foundational semiconductor business, providing financial stability and extensive R&D resources. The company actually tweaked a manufacturing line for standard semiconductors to crank out the Tunnel Falls system. If Intel can scale this approach up to a commercial mass-market volume, those chip-building facilities may become a game-changing competitive advantage.', ""Financial health: Intel is building a lot of manufacturing infrastructure right now, so its balance sheet has seen better days. Still, IonQ can't hold a candle to Intel's $11.5 billion of annual operating cash flows and $7 billion in cash reserves. Cash from the client computing, data center, and internet of things solutions are financing its forays into quantum computing."", ""Industry position: This company essentially built the semiconductor industry from scratch, and it remains a leading competitor nearly six decades later. With its dominant position in the sector, Intel's exploration of quantum computing benefits from its unmatched manufacturing capabilities and global research partnerships."", 'That\'s not the only household name on my list of IonQ alternatives today. Did you know that International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has been working on quantum systems for several years, too? Launched into the quantum realm in 2016 through its cloud computing platform, IBM has been at the forefront of making quantum computing accessible to researchers, developers, and organizations worldwide. Its quantum exploration has already produced a single system with 1,121 qubits and a groundbreaking way to ""knit"" smaller quantum modules together into larger systems with exponentially higher processing capacity. Big Blue isn\'t shipping its quantum tools to customers or research partners yet, but provides cloud-based access to its most advanced on-site systems.', ""Broader business model: IBM's transition to a hybrid cloud and AI company was long and uncomfortable -- even painful at times -- but the reformed business model now provides robust revenue growth. Most investors will keep their eyes on IBM's AI prospects over the next few years, while its quantum computing effort pursues its innovative goals in a quiet supporting role."", ""Financial health: With a robust $14 billion in cash from operations and $13.1 billion in cash and equivalents in 2023, IBM's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic investments. This financial stability is crucial as it underpins the company's ambitious R&D initiatives, including its quantum computing adventures."", 'Industry position: Formerly known as a one-stop shop for business-class computing needs, IBM has rewritten its playbook with a sharp focus on high-growth projects like the Red Hat operating system, hybrid cloud services, and AI tools. The company has been around for more than a hundred years and looks poised to compete in the ever-changing IT sector for another century.', ""It's kind of silly to call Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON) the least familiar name under the microscope today, but there you go."", 'The engineering giant has been into the quantum computing game since 2014, long enough to spin off its quantum team in a Cambridge University partnership called Quantinuum three years ago. Honeywell still controls that stand-alone company with a 54% ownership stake, though Quantinuum is going through the rounds of venture capital funding, perhaps preparing to enter the stock market someday. But so far, Quantinuum effectively remains a subsidiary of Honeywell.', ""Broader business model: Honeywell is primarily known for its industrial and aerospace products. The air conditioning thermostat in my kitchen has a Honeywell logo on it, probably alongside a thousand building components I'll never see. The company is a giant of several industries, sharing the common theme of advanced technology."", ""Financial health: Honeywell's diverse industrial presence provides a strong financial foundation, enabling sustained investment in quantum computing technologies. Its cash from operations added up to $5.3 billion last year and Honeywell has $7.9 billion of cash equivalents in the bank."", 'Industry position: As an industrial conglomerate, Honeywell brings a unique perspective to quantum computing, focusing on practical applications in materials science and optimization problems -- as any self-respecting engineer would. Quantinuum\'s official mission is to ""accelerate quantum computing and use its power to positively transform the world.""', ""IonQ offers an exciting opportunity to invest directly in quantum computing's potential. However, Intel, IBM, and Honeywell present more balanced options with far lower business risks. None of these industry giants are going away anytime soon, and I'm not sure you can say the same about IonQ. This hungry upstart must contend with rival solutions from several business legends with far deeper pockets. That's not an easy task."", ""All three of my IonQ alternatives are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) market index. I didn't set out to find Dow members with quantum computing ambitions, but that's where I landed anyway. These companies not only participate in the development of quantum computing but also boast diversified business models that mitigate the quantum industry's high risks."", ""For investors looking to tap into the quantum computing revolution while managing their risk, these three stocks represent a more prudent choice. I didn't buy Intel and IBM shares to gain exposure to quantum computing. Still, I'll gladly accept whatever research progress and future business success they may find in this side gig. And grabbing one or more of these titans looks like the safest way to invest in the quantum computing sector today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Specifically, its moving average score reached a designation of “strong buy.” In terms of oscillators, it landed at “buy.”', 'Analysts, not shockingly, endorse JPM stock with a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 17 buys, five holds and zero sells. Overall, the average price target hits $193.95, implying an upside of 11%. Further, the high-side target reaches up to $238, which comes courtesy of Oppenheimer. This forecast projects growth of over 36%.', 'Looking at JPM’s P&F chart, I see no indication of a compelling upside indicator. However, I don’t see any negative signs either. Looking at a straight chart view, JPM trades robustly above its 50 DMA, which is encouraging. On a fundamental note, the implied economic stability stemming from the strong jobs print should be net bullish for JPM.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'A popular soft-drink giant and an icon of American capitalism, you really can’t go wrong with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). With a predictable business and one that rewards its stakeholders through dividends, it’s no shock that technical indicators rate KO as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. According to TipRanks, KO’s moving average score rates as a “strong buy” while its oscillator score lands as a “buy.”', 'Analysts appreciate the KO, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as six buys, three holds and no sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $64.88, implying growth of over 7%. While that might not sound like much, keep in mind that the company pays a dividend of 3.09%. In addition, the potential projected risk is limited, with a downside target of $60.', 'Looking at KO’s P&F chart, StockCharts notes that it’s showing a low pole reversal. Per the investment resource, this pattern “implies that the supply that was making the prices fall has been absorbed and demand is taking over. The pattern is an alert that higher prices could be seen in the future.”', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A popular big-box retailing giant, Target (NYSE:TGT) incurred many troubles last year due to economic and social challenges. After some dark days, I’ve changed my tune on TGT. It’s good that I did because shares have been moving higher since then. Unsurprisingly, the TipRanks technical analysis screener identifies TGT as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. As with the other ideas, it features a “strong buy” moving average score and a “buy” reading regarding oscillators.', 'Analysts are also believers in the turnaround story, with the consensus view coming in as a moderate buy. However, it must be said that the average price target is conservative at $152.25. That implies only about 5% upside potential. Still, the high-side target clocks in at $180, projecting growth of nearly 24%.', 'Still, the experts may be too conservative. According to TGT’s P&F chart, it’s printing a triple top breakout. According to StockCharts, this pattern implies that “buyers are now creating more demand than there is supply and therefore the prices are breaking out.”', 'That’s a good problem to have if you’re a shareholder.', 'Source: George Sheldon via Shutterstock', 'One of the top cynical beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) soared following the doldrums of 2020. That may be because of the people’s concerns of their suddenly sedentary lifestyles. At least with Dick’s, the retailer could offer a fun mechanism for staying fit. Since September of 2021, though, DKS has been choppy.', 'But here’s the good news. Per TipRanks, DKS may be one of the stocks flashing buy signals. Its moving average score clocks in as a “strong buy.” Curiously, though, its oscillator score landed at only “neutral.” And while analysts are bullish on DKS with a moderate buy view, the average price target sits at $141.29. That implies more than 9% downside risk.', 'So, what gives? Well, the high-side target is $179, which would take DKS to 15% up. Also, its P&F chart shows an ascending triple top breakout. As stated earlier with Amazon, this pattern demonstrates an underlying strength that denotes a possible uptrend.', 'Fundamentally, the strong jobs report should boost discretionary spending. As a result, DKS could be an interesting dark horse.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'A real estate investment trust (REIT), Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) invests primarily in shopping centers. Now, that has caused some concerns among investors. Unfortunately, we’ve all heard about the end of the shopping mall as e-commerce becomes an ingrained component of our culture. Such a headwind puts KIM on the back foot. As a result, KIM is down more than 5% on a year-to-date basis.', 'Adding to the concerns, it slipped more than 10% over the past 52 weeks. However, TipRanks identifies KIM as a “strong buy” opportunity overall based on technical analysis. Individually, it rates very highly in terms of moving averages while its oscillator score comes in as “neutral.” At the same time, analysts rate KIM a moderate buy with an average price target of $23.33. That implies almost 16% upside potential.', 'Two factors make KIM even more compelling as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. First, its P&F chart reveals a possible bear trap in play. Per StockCharts, such a signal could mean a “quick reversal” with higher prices ahead. Second, Kimco offers a forward dividend yield of 4.76%, which is very enticing.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$3.54b', 'US$4.38b', 'US$5.08b', 'US$6.52b', 'US$7.14b', 'US$7.60b', 'US$8.00b', 'US$8.35b', 'US$8.66b', 'US$8.95b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 6.49%', 'Est @ 5.23%', 'Est @ 4.35%', 'Est @ 3.73%', 'Est @ 3.30%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% ', 'US$3.3k', 'US$3.7k', 'US$4.0k', 'US$4.7k', 'US$4.7k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.5k', 'US$4.3k', 'US$4.1k', 'US$3.9k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$42b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.362. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Instead, Visa partners with financial institutions like banks and credit unions by offering access to the Visa-branded payment network (for a fee)."", ""That's a key distinction, as Visa has no credit risk.

These stocks reward you with regular cash payments just for holding them. Moreover, dividends have accounted for the bulk of total returns from the U.S. stock market since 1900, a fact that often gets overlooked in today's growth-oriented market."", 'However, not all dividend stocks are table-pounding buys. Some are much better than others in terms of their quality, growth potential, and risk profile. The best dividend stocks are those that come from companies with a strong competitive advantage, reliable and increasing revenue, and healthy free cash flows.', 'Here are four dividend stocks that are proven wealth creators, making them top buys for the buy-and-hold crowd.', '1. Visa (NYSE: V) is a juggernaut in the digital payments space. As a result, the company has been able to generously reward its shareholders with a stunning dividend growth rate of 15.7% over the past five years.', 'This superb dividend growth rate also appears sustainable due to two key factors. First, Visa has a formidable competitive advantage in the digital payments industry. Second, it is a leader in a market that is growing by double digits annually right now.', ""So, while its yield of 0.75% may not be eye-catching, Visa's ultra-fast dividend growth rate and strong organic growth potential are solid reasons to buy its stock right now."", ""2. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is an oil and gas stalwart. Unlike Visa, ExxonMobil's five-year dividend growth rate of 1.77% isn't anything special. However, the oil and gas titan's stellar 3.73% annualized yield is more than twice that of the average stock listed on the S&P 500 index."", ""Plus, its smart cost-cutting strategies should keep its already robust free-cash-flow generation moving in the right direction, even with challenges from the industry's ongoing shift to renewables. In short, Exxon is a high-yield dividend stock that stands out as a reliable passive income play."", ""3. Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is not just a big box retailer; it's a dividend powerhouse. The company has been rewarding its loyal shareholders with annual dividend increases since 1974, making it one of the most consistent dividend payers in the market. And that's not all."", 'Walmart is also planning to split its stock 3-for-1 later this month, which will make it more accessible and attractive to a wider range of investors. This move could boost its share price and deliver even more value to long-term holders.', ""Some people might overlook Walmart's dividend because of its low 1.35% yield and sluggish growth rate of 1.85% over the past five years. But they would be missing out on a great opportunity. Walmart's business is highly profitable and resilient, and its dividend is a proven commodity. In fact, the retail giant has markedly outperformed the broader market since 1990, thanks in no small part to its robust dividend program."", 'WMT Total Return Level data by YCharts', '4. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) arguably deserves more recognition as a dividend stock. The tech giant has transformed itself into a leader in cloud computing and artificial intelligence, boosting its revenue by a staggering 558% and its earnings by a mind-blowing 2,000% since it initiated its dividend program in 2003.', 'MSFT Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts', ""Compared to those scorching metrics, though, Microsoft's meager 0.71% yield might seem insignificant, but don't let that fool you. Microsoft is a fantastic dividend growth stock."", 'To wit, the company has increased its dividend by an impressive 10.2% annually over the past five years, and its free cash flows have also doubled in that time.', ""That's an amazing combination that should appeal to dividend growth investors.

It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine."", ""We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' See our latest analysis for Snap-on ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows.

The whole point of investing is making money. Dividends are money. Therefore, buying high-yield dividend stocks is a great way to achieve your investing goal.', ""That simplistic line of thinking, however, ignores several more important realities that come with stock picking. The big takeaway is that big dividend yields alone don't tell the whole story. Other questions need to be asked (and answered), like: Can those big dividend payments be sustained? Is the stock in question set to lose more value than its dividend payments are worth? Will that particular pick even be able to outpace inflation in the long run?"", ""Before you go hunting for high yields, even among the market's biggest names, here's what you need to consider."", ""There's no point in beating around the bush -- the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) highest-paying dividend stocks right now are Altria Group (NYSE: MO), Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI), and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), sporting yields of 9.7%, 6.8%, and 6.6% (respectively). Honorable mentions go out to Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) and 3M (NYSE: MMM), both of which aren't too far behind Verizon in terms of yield. In fact, it's possible that, by the time you're reading this, some of those positions will be changed."", 'The overarching question remains, though: Are any or all of these tickers worth stepping into due to their superior dividend yields?', 'In a word, no.', ""Don't misunderstand. Some of these names might be right for you. Take tobacco giant Altria as an example. Although the cigarette business doesn't have much of a long-term future, it's got plenty of years -- maybe even decades -- of cash flow to generate before smoking-cessation efforts make the tobacco business untenable. You're collecting almost 10% per year on your investment in the meantime. Not bad."", ""If you're looking for long-term capital appreciation in addition to income, however, Altria isn't in a great position to offer it. The world understands the tobacco business has little to no growth left to offer. The stock is apt to increasingly reflect this reality as time marches on. What a dividend in the interim, though!"", ""Verizon's slightly more attractive in this regard, but only slightly."", ""Yes, now that people are addicted to mobile phones, they will never go without them. That's why Verizon will forever have a revenue-bearing market to serve. The company is also building a wireless connectivity business meant to serve enterprise-level customers in need of private 5G networks. Straits Research suggests this young industry is set to expand at an annualized pace of nearly 44% through 2031. Wow! That's a serious tailwind for Verizon to plug into."", ""However, private networking is still only a small piece of Verizon's revenue mix. Great growth in this market won't actually meaningfully move the needle for Verizon's total revenue. The wireless market is also highly saturated, though, forcing margin-crimping price wars. In the meantime, the $138 billion worth of long-term debt on the company's books is getting a whole lot more expensive now that interest rates are well up and off of the rock-bottom lows still seen just a couple of years back. Making bigger interest payments further eats into profits."", ""Verizon is hardly doomed, to be clear. Connect the dots, though. The company's margins could be thin for the foreseeable future, with subpar dividend growth in the cards as a result."", ""As for oil and gas middleman Kinder Morgan, there's a little more hope for income-minded investors."", ""If you're not familiar, Kinder Morgan helps the energy industry get oil and gas to where it needs to be. The company owns or has a stake in 82,000 miles of pipelines, 139 oil and gas terminals, and 702 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity. It's also a gas producer, although the bulk of its business is logistics and transportation. This is a business built to support dividend payments, too, since it charges the same delivery fee regardless of the price of the oil and gas being transported through its pipes. Just think of it as a tollbooth."", 'It seems like a two-edged sword -- on the surface. Obviously, the world is still reliant on oil and gas, but renewables are the future. There will come a point in time when we no longer need hydrocarbons.', ""That time is much, much further down the road than many people might believe, however. Although the International Energy Administration expects oil consumption's growth to slow dramatically between now and 2028 before practically peaking by 2030, the agency also expects the world to still be using about as much oil and gas in 2050 as it's using now."", 'This, of course, bodes well for Kinder Morgan.', ""There's a bigger point to be made than the deeper dives into each of these companies' true risks and rewards, of course. That is, stock-picking is more than simply plowing into a new position based solely on one number (in this case, the current dividend yield). The number doesn't tell you much of anything about the company's current health or its forward-looking prospects."", ""Indeed, the number isn't even guaranteed to persist."", 'Take the aforementioned 3M as an example. Although the company has been able to not only pay a quarterly dividend for decades now but raise its payout for 64 consecutive years, soaring legal costs linked to a massive class action lawsuit have some observers wondering if a dividend cut is inevitable if 3M wants to successfully navigate the foreseeable future.', ""With all of that being said, if you're still looking for a high-yielding S&P 500 constituent to plug into here, Kinder Morgan is your best bet. The nature of its tollbooth-like business makes the dividend's underlying cash flow sustainable. And the need for oil and gas isn't going to fade anytime soon. There's also plenty of opportunity for Kinder Morgan to expand its operation in the future, in turn expanding the dividend."", ""Bottom line? Even with dividend stocks, you're buying unique companies in unique situations. You should always take a step back and examine the bigger picture, no matter how big the dividend yield is."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kinder Morgan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kinder Morgan, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Kinder Morgan wasn’t one of them.

To many, the current AI revolution came out of nowhere. But even before the earth-shaking debut of ChatGPT in November 2022, there were early indications AI was turning a corner."", 'Is there another new technology at a pre-breakthrough stage today? Quantum computing may be at that point. In fact, quantum computing leader IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) just announced a technological breakthrough that could pave the way toward commercialization of the technology very soon.', 'While transistor-packed semiconductors such as Nvidia H100s can do a massive amount of computing, each transistor still operates on a binary code of either 1 or 0 to store information.', ""Quantum computing may disrupt even high-end AI classical computing because it can perform far more computations in a shorter amount of time. When a quantum ion is hit with a laser in a vacuum or electromagnetic field, the laser stimulates the ion's electrons, putting the ion in a dual state of both particle and wave. Measuring all the different probabilities of states between 1 and 0 gives quantum systems the ability to do exponentially more calculations than traditional transistors."", 'The problem is, of course, that quantum technology is extremely difficult to pull off. But IonQ just hit a new technological milestone last month that may start to turn some heads.', 'On January 25, IonQ issued a press release noting it had achieved what it calls an ""#AQ 35"" quantum system named Forte one year ahead of schedule.', 'The term #AQ signifies the number of algorithmic qbits, and was a terminology developed by IonQ in conjunction with the largest quantum industry consortium to measure the computing power of quantum systems.', ""But each increasing number doesn't indicate a linear advancement -- it's an exponential advancement. For instance, future #AQ 64 systems wouldn't be 35 times as powerful as last year's #AQ 29 system, it will be roughly 34 billion times as powerful! So as IonQ links up more and more qbits in a system -- a very difficult feat -- the total system's power grows by leaps and bounds."", ""Why is the #AQ 35 system such a big milestone, even relative to last year's #AQ 29 systems? Because #AQ 35 is thought to be the first quantum system threshold sufficiently powerful to outperform traditional computing for certain commercial applications."", 'Quantum computing is thought to be a superior alternative to classic computing when calculating a number of possibilities, combinations, or permutations so large it would take classical systems years to compute all the various scenarios. So various types of machine learning, optimization (such as in global logistics), complex scenario analysis, and material science and drug discovery applications are prime candidates where quantum may lead to breakthroughs.', 'While some of these applications may only be cracked by future systems with #AQ numbers in the thousand-plus range, #AQ 35 is thought to be the first threshold where quantum computing outdoes classical computing AI for applications like autonomous driving, anti-fraud detection, and search ad optimization.', ""So last month's under-the-radar announcement of reaching 35 qbits may be a bigger deal than investors may realize."", 'Currently, IonQ has two large customers, which are essentially either research labs or government entities. These include the U.S. Air Force Research Lab and QuantumBasel in Switzerland. IonQ also just inked a collaboration with Seoul National University in South Korea for joint research.', 'When will quantum computing break through the research stage and make inroads into the private sector, potentially disrupting artificial intelligence winners such as Nvidia?', ""It's hard to say. IonQ has actually done a few pilot projects with private enterprises, including Airbus for airplane design and Hyundai Motors for autonomous vehicles."", ""However, while each of these partnerships commenced over a year ago, there haven't been any recent disclosures on any specific breakthroughs."", ""At least not yet. But with the achievement of #AQ 35 two weeks ago, perhaps the new system will usher in an era of commercial quantum computing and perhaps launch IonQ's stock to more prominence."", 'Do Nvidia investors have anything to fear? That may be a stretch -- even though IonQ specifically and quantum computing generally have disruptive potential, quantum may only disrupt a portion of all computing. Even IonQ forecasts the quantum computing total addressable market will be ""only"" $65 billion by 2030.', ""That's large, but much smaller than the computing industry as a whole. That's probably because quantum may only be cost-effective for applications where it's really needed and traditional computing won't suffice."", ""Nevertheless, whichever company breaks through first and becomes the leader in this emerging field could make investors fortunes. So investors should closely track IonQ's progress in 2024 on the back of its recent #AQ 35 achievement."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?', 'Before you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and IonQ wasn’t one of them.

That's because Visa doesn't issue credit or debit cards. Indeed, contrary to popular belief, Visa doesn't offer customers credit, set rates, or charge fees. Instead, Visa partners with financial institutions like banks and credit unions by offering access to the Visa-branded payment network (for a fee)."", ""That's a key distinction, as Visa has no credit risk. It also means the company's revenue is largely tied to the volume of payments and transactions on its network. "", ""At any rate, Visa's no-nonsense business model has delivered exceptional shareholder gains. Over the last decade, Visa's stock has generated an annualized total return (price appreciation plus dividend payments) of 18.4%."", 'That means $50,000 invested in Visa 10 years ago would be worth $271,000 today -- not too shabby. However, I also have my eye on some spicier picks.', ""Next up is a younger, faster-growing company. It's CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leader in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. While I value Visa for its steady growth, CrowdStrike is all about potential. "", 'The company is growing revenue at a 35% year-over-year rate as of its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Oct. 31, 2023). Moreover, the overall cybersecurity market that CrowdStrike aims to satisfy is growing by leaps and bounds. ', ""In short, that's because cybercrime is booming. Hackers -- seeking money, political retribution, or chaos -- are running amok right now. Large organizations, ranging from large-cap corporations to governments and non-profits, are all scrambling to protect their networks, harden their defenses, and safeguard their data."", 'More to the point, some analysts expect the cybersecurity market to grow by 50% to $274 billion by 2028 -- presenting a significant opportunity for cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike.', ""At any rate, CrowdStrike's stock has rewarded investors since its debut in 2019. Its total return since then is more than 423% or almost 43% annually."", ""In other words, $50,000 invested in CrowdStrike's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on June 12, 2019, would be worth $260,000 as of the time of this writing. "", ""That's an impressive return, and if CrowdStrike shares grow at that rate over the next decade, my hypothetical portfolio would be well on its way to $1 million. "", 'However, I still have one final pick to make.', ""Last, we arrive at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In my opinion, no other stock can match Nvidia's combination of actual results and potential."", ""As for the results, they're plain to see. Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and many others are buying all the Nvidia AI chips they can get their hands on. And yet, the demand seems insatiable because the world can't get enough of artificial intelligence (AI)."", 'For his part, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang put it this way: ""For the very first time, because of generative AI, computer technology is going to impact literally every single industry and every single country.""', 'So, given the massive demand for AI chips, it should come as no surprise that Nvidia has been one of the best stocks to own over the last 10 years.', 'Indeed, a $50,000 investment made in Nvidia shares 10 years ago would now be worth an astronomical $9.2 million as of this writing.', ""It's hard to believe that a similar return is possible for Nvidia shares over the next 10 years, but no one really knows. "", 'One thing is certain: The world is desperate for more AI products, which means more AI chips. Nvidia is currently the market leader, but others, like AMD and Intel, want to catch up.

Investors think the performance will improve, as customers can't get enough of Nvidia's products to power their artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations."", 'The danger for Nvidia isn\'t how the business is doing -- it\'s the pressure that investors are putting on the stock. The higher Nvidia goes before the fundamentals can catch up to the valuation, the greater the risk that Nvidia becomes a ""story stock."" With a 92.6 price-to-earnings ratio, some may argue it already is one.', 'A story stock is a company whose valuation is based entirely on a story, or what it could become in the future rather than what it is today. Tesla did this in 2020 when it posted the incredible 743% return mentioned earlier. But Tesla largely lived up to the hype, as its revenue and bottom-line growth have been incredibly strong. Sure, the business has slowed recently. But overall, it has been an impressive period for Tesla, the company.', 'Tesla the stock, however, is actually down by more than 20% from where it traded at the end of 2020.', ""The stock's more recent underperformance is largely because investors were willing to pay such a high price for Tesla before it delivered its stunning results. When Tesla did that in 2021, 2022, and 2023, investors had already priced that progress in. I fear the same dynamic may play out with Nvidia."", 'Tesla is a perfect example of how a business can deliver excellent results at the same time as its stock is performing poorly, simply because the stock price previously got too far ahead of itself.', ""The tailwinds for Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor industry are stronger than ever. It's just that Nvidia stock is, at least for now, priced for perfection. But that doesn't mean it should be avoided altogether."", 'The Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) is well-suited for investors who feel like they\'ve been caught flat-footed while the AI ascension has zoomed past them. Nvidia makes up 5.3% of the ETF -- a sizable position, but not enough to make or break its performance. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- comprise over 50% of the fund.', ""Unsurprisingly, the Vanguard Growth ETF is at an all-time high, and the valuations of its top components have gotten much more expensive. But for just a 0.04% expense ratio, or 4 cents for every $100 invested, an investor can get exposure to a lot of megacap growth names, including Nvidia. It's a good way to get a starter position in Nvidia without overly committing."", ""At this point, I don't think investors have to fear Nvidia stock will run away from them. In many ways, its big gains are behind it; it's too late to buy Nvidia if you were looking to nearly 5x your money in a little over a year. Aside from getting limited exposure with the Vanguard Growth ETF or a similar fund, I think the best way to approach Nvidia now would be to simply hit the pause button and wait."", ""If the company's fundamentals have improved a year or two from now, but the stock price has languished, then Nvidia will be a far better value (and probably a strong buy). But for now, so many expectations have been pulled forward, leaving too much hot air and room for the stock to fall."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Investors may have been spooked by some commentary from CEO Seifi Ghasemi, who had this dire warning on the last earnings call:', ""I'd just like to caution everybody on the call that the economic situation in China is not as robust as people might think. As you know, we make products that are used instantaneously. We are a great leading indicator. And things are not really that exciting in that part of the world."", ""China is the world's second-largest economy, accounting for nearly 20% of global GDP. If economic conditions get tough in China, it can spell disaster for many company stocks that do business there. Is Air Products sounding the alarm for investors?"", ""From a high-level view, Air Products' stock plunge was due to the company lowering its outlook for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per share. Previously, it was expecting about 13% growth this year. After its first-quarter update (for the period ended in December 2023, as Air Products' fiscal year ends in October), management downgraded adjusted earnings growth expectations to 6% to 9% over 2023."", ""The reason for the downgrade? Ghasemi noted the lackluster outlook for China's economy, and Air Products is specifically feeling the pinch in its helium business. What's the deal with helium?"", ""Helium is obtained during oil and natural gas extraction. As Air Products is a leader in natural gas equipment technology, it's naturally also a top supplier of helium. And helium has become a critical ingredient in all sorts of technology and manufacturing processes."", 'One of the manufacturing processes that uses ample amounts of helium is the production of semiconductor devices. China has been buying lots of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to bolster its domestic chipmaking capabilities. Record shipments of chipmaking machinery were sold to China in 2023 from top suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, and others. As semiconductors have proliferated around the world, helium prices have increased.', ""But now it seems that chip manufacturing activity is tapering off in China. Air Products' largest volume of helium sales goes to China, so the declining helium demand off peak levels (and thus ultimate pricing) is starting to falter too."", ""The short story is this: Air Products' business in China may be indicating what's going on in semiconductor manufacturing, instead of indicating a widespread downturn for the economy overall and impending doom for investors."", ""Of course, the making and sale of electronics has become critical to global economic health, so Air Products' warning on China is worth monitoring. But at this point, this appears to be normal business cyclicality from an industrial giant."", 'Besides, while helium sales in the East are having an effect on Air Products\' profitability right now, the bulk of this business is still tied to the ""energy transition"" economy. That means higher energy consumption derived from sources like liquid natural gas (or LNG, in which Air Products is the top supplier of LNG liquefaction equipment) and the emerging hydrogen energy industry. This core energy operation is still growing, and Air Products is investing heavily ($5 billion to $5.5 billion in capital expenditures this year alone) in support of it.', ""After the latest update, Air Products stock trades for cheaper than it has in years at 21 times trailing 12-month earnings per share, and 15 times on a one-year-forward expected earnings basis. Earnings growth may be slowing, but 2022 and 2023 were an especially strong couple of years. The company has a long track record of steady growth, and now yields a 3.3% annual dividend. I was slowly adding to my position last year, and see no reason to stop now -- even if China's economy is temporarily throttling growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Air Products And Chemicals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Air Products And Chemicals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Air Products And Chemicals wasn’t one of them.

However, investors were willing to overlook the lack of growth as revenue shifted to growth businesses like the direct-to-consumer streaming segment, which was up 15% year over year to $5.5 billion, and the experiences segment, which rose 7% to $9.1 billion.', 'Disney also generated records from its experiences segment for quarterly revenue, operating income, and operating margin.', 'Adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.99 to $1.22 as management slashed its streaming losses from $984 million to $138 million.

It unveiled a partnership with Epic Games, investing $1.5 billion for an equity stake in the Fortnite maker in a move that will bring characters from a wide range of Disney properties to a new games and entertainment universe.

For other entertainment companies, Disney remains an attractive partner.', ""Iger still needs to deliver on the goals above, but the path to get there is becoming increasingly clear. Disney must turn a profit in its direct-to-consumer division, and the company's embrace of a new sports streaming package with Fox and Warner Bros.

Improved fundamentals, the resolution of a major issue, or merely an improvement in investor sentiment can result in a big re-rating to the upside within a reasonable time frame.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'The following seven undervalued stocks to buy all fit within this category.

Shares in the agribusiness giant have started to recover, as investors look into the details of the scandal, and determine that the market’s initial response may have been an overreaction.', 'With the alleged accounting irregularities occurring within a business unit making up less than 10% of the company’s overall revenue, the potential impact of this scandal may be minimal. That’s not to say ADM stock will quickly return to pre-scandal prices immediately, but a steady climb back to prior levels may happen in the months ahead.', 'Beyond recovering from this scandal, a rebound in global food demand/prices will likely help agribusiness stocks like Archer-Daniels-Midland bounce back as well. Trading for just 8 times forward earnings, and with a 3.6% dividend to boot, joining the crowd of contrarian investors snapping up ADM right now could prove profitable.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) may be one of the best undervalued stocks to buy in the pharmaceuticals sector. After sinking more than 35% from its 52-week high, shares in this big pharma firm trade for only 6.6 times earnings.', 'BMY stock also has a forward dividend yield of 4.91%. Sure, on the surface, Bristol-Myers Squibb may seem like a potential value trap. Forecasts call for negative earnings growth this year. The company has also extended its sales ramp-up timeline for new drug products that are needed to replace existing blockbuster drugs experiencing declining sales due to generic competition.', 'Still, with negative sentiment so heavily priced-in, it may not take much to drive a big partial recovery for BMY. Even the potential upside from a partial rebound could exceed downside risk, given the extent in which this pharma stock has been discounted by the market.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Since early 2023, shares in toy and game giant Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) have attempted to make a recovery. But, after experiencing a strong rebound between March and September of last year, the stock has since fallen back by around 31.5%. Chalk this up to uncertainty about Hasbro’s near-term operating performance.', 'However, as I argued when last writing about HAS stock in December, the company’s turnaround efforts could prove successful, shifting sentiment from bearish back to bullish. Turnaround plans have included the sale of non-core businesses to raise cash for de-leveraging purposes. Hasbro has also made efforts to reduce costs through layoffs.', 'If these efforts lead to stronger earnings in the quarters ahead, the stock (at around $50 per share today) could swing back to its 52-week high of $73.58 per share, or even higher. While waiting for the turnaround, you can collect HAS’s 5.72% dividend.', 'Source: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com', 'Admittedly, it may seem odd to include Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) in the “undervalued stocks” category. After all, shares in this China-based electric vehicle (EV) maker trade for 23.3 times forward earnings. Yet given how many of Li’s early-stage competitors, like Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) currently operate at a loss, this valuation appears more-than-reasonable.', 'The valuation of LI stock also appears more-than-reasonable, when you consider the extent in which Li’s earnings could grow in 2024. Consensus calls for earnings growth of around 40.8%, but the high end of forecasts call for earnings to nearly double, from $1.25 to $2.45 per share.', 'While not guaranteed, Li’s strong January 2024 delivery numbers – up 105.8% year-over-year – suggest that achieving such high levels of growth this year is very possible. In turn, this could help LI – down 38% from its 52-week high – make a strong recovery this year.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock', 'Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is another value stock that could experience a rapid recovery. In fact, shares in the media conglomerate could reach higher price far sooner than many of the other stocks discussed above and below.', 'Why? In Wall Street parlance, Paramount Global is “in play.” Media mogul Byron Allen recently made a $14.3 billion bid for the whole company. Not all of Allen’s past media takeover bids have resulted in deals. However, Allen could end up with portions of the company, such as its television assets.', 'Other strategic buyers are interested, including Skydance Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD). Paramount has formed an independent committee to assess possible strategic alternatives like a sale. The Redstone family, who control the company, appears interested in making a deal. If you are interested in taking a speculative position in a potential takeover stock, PARA is one such opportunity.', 'Source: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com', 'Look up The Children’s Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) on a stock screener, and at first it may not seem like it’s one of the undervalued stocks. Based on trailing earnings, shares in this children’s apparel retailer are not cheap. The company has reported heavy losses over the past twelve months.', 'However, as a Seeking Alpha commentator bullish on PLCE stock recently pointed out, The Children’s Place remains on track to reduce debt and make big improvements in profitability. This gives credence to sell-side earnings forecasts, which call for PLCE’s earnings to go from negative 49 cents last fiscal year ending January 2024 to $2.54 per share this fiscal year ending January 2025.', 'Achieving such an earnings recovery will undoubtedly result in a recovery for The Children’s Place shares.

The recent U.S. economic challenges have weighed on RCI’s operating performance. This explains why shares have tumbled over the past year.', 'However, as I argued last month, a post-slowdown recovery may lead to an earnings and stock price rebound. Cooling inflation and lower interest rates may enable RCI to hit forecasts calling for earnings of $6.38 per share next fiscal year ending September 2025.

The company is expanding its sales footprint at a pace that makes it one of the fastest-expanding brands in the fast-food industry. Management plans to launch as many as 165 new locations in 2024, boosting the store base by 20%.', ""There are major trade-offs to investing in a company that's this early in its growth story, though. It's an especially risky proposition in the restaurant industry, which is known for weak profit margins and high rates of failure as consumers' tastes shift from one year to the next."", ""Most investors are better off focusing on established and profitable businesses. Let's take a look at why you might like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) more than the fast-expanding Dutch Bros business right now."", ""It's no exaggeration to say that Mickey D's has the fast-food marketing process all figured out. The company has been serving up its Big Mac sandwich for over 50 years and thrived through several recessions and many shifts in consumer tastes during that time."", ""You don't have to worry about a surprise sales decline seriously hurting this massive global business. In contrast with Dutch Bros and its projected $1.2 billion of revenue in 2024, most Wall Street pros see McDonald's generating $25 billion in the same period. A huge portion of that revenue comes from stable franchise fees, royalty fees, and rent income, too."", ""Profits aren't a concern as they might be with Dutch Bros. In fact, McDonald's is pushing its profitability to new highs toward a blazing 50% of sales (compared to Dutch Bros' 5%). That figure sat at 30% of sales just a decade ago, so McDonald's is still finding ways to squeeze more efficiency out of its global platform."", ""Choosing Starbucks over Dutch Bros isn't going to force you into the growth compromises that you might expect when purchasing an established, mature business. The coffee titan is expanding more quickly at its existing locations right now, after all, having boosted same-store sales by 5% last quarter, compared to Dutch Bros' 4% rate. It has plenty of room to add to its huge store base, as well, despite having blanketed most metro markets with its cafes."", ""Starbucks is pushing into more rural locations, for example, with help from its expanding drive-thru presence. Toss in a thriving international business, and you've got some excellent growth avenues for the coming years.

The platform hosts more than one-billion reviews, helpful for almost any traveler no matter where they're going."", ""However, it's fair to wonder if Tripadvisor is losing its relevance. After all, Alphabet's Google can provide some of the same insights as Tripadvisor. And considering how many people use Google Maps, it might even be easier to check out reviews on Google."", ""I believe this possibility is supported by the numbers. Tripadvisor has reorganized its business over the years so direct comparisons are challenging. However, in 2019 the company's Tripadvisor brand (representing nearly all its sales then) generated revenue of $939 million."", 'By comparison, in 2023 the whole company generated total revenue $813 million through the first three quarters, putting it on pace for just a hair more than $1 billion over the entire year. So growth over the last three years has been quite meager and suggests its best days for growth are over.', ""Growth may be coming to an end for Tripadvisor. But fortunately the company owns a travel platform that's experiencing some of the hottest growth in the entire sector. And it may hold the key to the future success of Tripadvisor stock."", ""Nearly a decade ago, Tripadvisor acquired a platform called Viator. And it appears that Viator's time has finally arrived."", ""Tripadvisor only started breaking out Viator's financial results in 2022, so investors can't track its progress too far back. However, Viator has generated revenue of $576 million through the first three quarters of 2023, which is a 57% increase from the comparable period of 2022."", 'Viator is more similar to Airbnb than it is to Tripadvisor. Third parties list bookable experiences on the Viator platform. Travelers then browse and book. Viator then collects the payment, pays the experience organizer, and keeps a cut for itself much in the same way that Airbnb does business.', ""This is a different business model from Tripadvisor's. Tripadvisor has links for booking hotels on other platforms, and the company is paid per click. The platform also allows the display of ads for which it's paid for impressions (views)."", 'The travel-experience market is a budding opportunity, and Viator appears to be the frontrunner. Airbnb\'s co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky might be a little jealous considering he\'s foreseen this trend for a long time. Way back in 2018, Chesky told USA Today that travel experiences were an ""Amazon-sized opportunity.""', ""Rumor has it that Amazon is pretty big. And indeed, Viator is already a big deal for Tripadvisor. In the third quarter of 2023, revenue from Viator accounted for 46% of the company's total revenue."", ""I love the Tripadvisor stock opportunity today. At less than two times its trailing sales, shares have almost never been cheaper, and they trade well below their historical average. Moreover, the business is very high margin with its gross margin consistently more than 90%. And Viator's surging adoption gives the company an underappreciated growth engine for the long term."", ""That said, there's one glaring concern I have with this company today: Tripadvisor has always been high margin. But despite this advantage, profits have been few and far between over the last several years. And one of the main culprits is how much is spent on sales and marketing."", 'The chart below offers a comparison of Tripadvisor against Airbnb and Booking Holdings. Of these three travel stocks, Tripadvisor currently spends the most on sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue. But of the three, it has the slowest top-line growth right now.', 'My fear is that Tripadvisor might only enjoy top-line growth because it spends heavily to drive traffic to its platform. And if its traffic is truly dependent on this spending, then the company may never be able to generate meaningful profits for shareholders.', ""That said, the older Tripadvisor brand may be more dependent on spending that drives traffic. By contrast, its possible that Viator is gaining enough brand awareness to generate organic traffic, much like Airbnb does. If that's the case, the business could enjoy operating leverage as Viator scales."", ""Assuming this latter scenario plays out, this investment could be really good for shareholders considering that Tripadvisor's market cap is only $3 billion. That's a really cheap valuation if it successfully scales into and profits from this large and growing opportunity in the travel industry."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Tripadvisor right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Tripadvisor, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tripadvisor wasn’t one of them.

It's been a huge winner in the past, and it's also hitting all-time highs. But the shares might still deserve your investment dollars."", ""Is this top financial stock a buy, sell, or hold right now? Let's take a closer look at American Express."", 'Despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that most businesses continue to grapple with, American Express keeps posting stellar financial results. This explains why the stock has climbed 11% this year.', ""Strong spending trends among its cardholders, particularly with the younger client base, as well as in travel and entertainment, helped push sales (net of interest expense) up 11% year over year to $15.8 billion. You would imagine that in uncertain economic climates people would be paring back their spending, but the numbers from AmEx show that this just isn't the case right now."", ""To be clear, there is worrying data out there indicating that credit card debt in the U.S. has never been higher. While this is true, and can be viewed as a significant risk factor, AmEx's default rates are typically well below its banking peers'. That's because this company attracts a more affluent and lower-risk customer. The Q4 charge-off rate of 2% is below pre-pandemic levels."", 'This business is reporting strong bottom-line growth, too. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 27% in the last quarter, thanks to a 31% surge in net interest income. In the current year, executives forecast a 13% to 17% increase in diluted EPS.', 'As we look out even further, American Express should benefit from some key trends that can support solid growth. The popularity of cashless transactions can boost the number of AmEx cardholders and the payment volume that the company handles. Moreover, should inflation be a lingering issue, this business is somewhat insulated, as its revenue is directly tied to spending activity.', ""What makes American Express a special company, and likely a top reason that Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway owns such a sizable stake, is due to the presence of a wide economic moat. This supports the business's success and strong financial performance over the long term by making it difficult for rivals to compete effectively."", 'American Express is a powerful brand in the world of finance. This results in merchants paying higher fees to accept these cards, while cardholders are asked to pay high annual membership dues for access to the top-notch rewards and perks.', 'Perhaps even better, this business possesses network effects. Operating a two-sided platform with those merchants and customers means AmEx has successfully cracked the ""chicken-and-egg"" problem. If another company tried to launch a competing payments network, it would struggle to attract buyers without any places to spend, and vice versa. This protects American Express\'s industry position, minimizing the threat of disruption.', ""Regardless of the wonderful traits a company might have, if investors overpay, returns aren't going to be satisfactory. In this case, shares are trading hands at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.6, which is about in line with the stock's historical five-year average. Consequently, I view the shares as reasonably valued right now."", ""For prospective investors, I believe it's a good time to be a buyer of this stock.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price has flown 126% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock!"", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""During three years of share price growth, Occidental Petroleum moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', 'It is of course excellent to see how Occidental Petroleum has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.', ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Occidental Petroleum's TSR for the last 3 years was 131%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""While the broader market gained around 23% in the last year, Occidental Petroleum shareholders lost 10% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.7% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

That makes it one of Berkshire's top holdings, just behind fellow oil and gas company Chevron (NYSE: CVX)."", ""The Oracle of Omaha has added to his Occidental position on three separate occasions since the start of December. His most recent purchase for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio amounted to about $246 million. That follows purchases of about $589 million and $312 million in December. Meanwhile, Berkshire still owns about $8.5 billion worth of preferred shares in Occidental, which pay an 8% dividend."", ""Here's why Occidental has become Buffett's favorite energy stock\xa0and could soon top Chevron as Berkshire's biggest investment in the industry."", ""Occidental and Chevron are both integrated oil and gas companies. However, where Chevron makes most of its money from downstream operations like refineries and chemical plants, Occidental is heavily invested in drilling oil out of the ground. As a result, Occidental's business is much more closely tied to the price of oil."", ""Its strong position in the Permian Basin gives it a cheap source of oil production. It strengthened that position with the acquisition of Anadarko, supported by Berkshire's $10 billion investment in the company. More recently, it added CrownRock last December, when Buffett started buying up shares again."", ""Occidental's big investments in the Permian Basin have put pressure on its balance sheet. The company now holds a significant amount of debt. Management plans to divest non-core assets to accelerate the paydown of that debt. It did something similar following the Anadarko acquisition in 2019 and the subsequent drop in oil prices in 2020."", ""The moves to add more cheap sources of oil make sense in light of Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub's extreme bullishness on the price of the commodity. For one, she said the CrownRock acquisition will generate an additional $1 billion in cash flow in its first year as long as oil prices remain above $70. That was exactly the spot price of oil at the time of the acquisition, and it's only climbed to the mid-70s since."", 'More recently, Hollub has noted the potential for an oil supply shortage as soon as 2025. A production cut from OPEC combined with growing demand from China will push oil prices higher, she says. As a result, she sees oil climbing to $80 per barrel by the end of the year.', 'Buffett has a lot of confidence in Hollub. He called her ""an extraordinary manager"" at Berkshire\'s 2023 Shareholder meeting in May. After managing the company through the depressed oil prices of 2020 right after acquiring Anadarko, she seems to be up for almost any task.', 'Shares of Occidental have gotten off to a poor start in 2024. While Chevron shares have climbed about 2% since the start of the year, Occidental is down about 3.5%.', 'Moreover, the valuation for Occidental is extremely attractive. Shares currently trade for an enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA) multiple of just 5x. By comparison, Chevron trades for a 6.6x multiple.', ""That said, there's a lot more risk in buying Occidental than competing oil and gas companies. For one, it's heavily reliant on the price of oil. As explained, the bulk of its revenue comes from drilling, not downstream operations. Moreover, Occidental's balance sheet includes substantial levels of debt following the CrownRock acquisition. That leverage puts added pressure on management if oil prices decline in the future, making it less profitable to drill."", ""It's important to note that while Buffett is very confident in the future of Occidental, it's still less than 4% of Berkshire's equity portfolio and an even smaller percentage of the conglomerate's total holdings when you include its cash position and wholly owned subsidiaries. So, remaining diversified is key."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

It's easy to see why. The oil and gas producer owns some of the most valuable acreage in the shale-rich Permian Basin. It's also a leader in the potentially multitrillion-dollar market for decarbonization solutions."", ""Berkshire first invested in Occidental in 2019 as a part of a deal to help finance the latter's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Buffett's investment conglomerate has purchased shares on multiple occasions since then. Berkshire now owns roughly 28% of Occidental's shares, currently valued at more than $14 billion, along with preferred shares and warrants that could allow it to boost its stake in the oil driller."", ""Buffett is no doubt attracted to Occidental's prized assets in the Permian Basin. The company's operations in the oil- and gas-rich region, which spans from West Texas to southeast New Mexico, are well situated to supply the U.S. and international markets with dependable and cost-effective energy."", 'CEO Vicki Hollub has also positioned Occidental to be a leader in the promising area of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The forward-thinking executive wants to help build a global network of direct air capture (DAC) facilities. DAC technology, which can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is expected to play a key role in enabling governments and businesses to achieve their net-zero emissions goals.', 'All told, carbon capture services could become a $4 trillion market by 2050, according to ExxonMobil. Occidental, in turn, believes that its carbon management operations could eventually eclipse its traditional oil and gas businesses.', ""Like Occidental, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of massive global markets. With artificial intelligence (AI) set to boost the functionality of its popular devices, the tech titan's profits are poised to climb from their already stratospheric levels."", 'Buffett is clearly a fan. Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly $170 billion worth of Apple stock -- more than five times as much as its second-largest position.', ""Buffett appreciates Apple's fortress-like balance sheet and staggering profitability. With cash and investments of more than $170 billion as of Dec. 30, 2023, and net income of over $100 billion during the trailing 12 months, the iPhone maker displays an unparalleled level of financial fortitude."", ""Buffett also understands the value of Apple's brand. People trust that -- unlike many other high-tech products -- Apple's devices simply work and are intuitive to use. And once someone buys one of the tech specialist's phones or computers, they tend to remain a loyal customer. These factors give the company a level of pricing power that its rivals do not possess, which helps Apple earn higher profit margins."", ""Moreover, with over 2.2 billion devices in use worldwide, Apple has a huge base of customers who are eager to buy its latest products and services. That allows the company to enter new markets and quickly win sales despite charging premium prices. Investors are likely to see this trend play out once again with the tech giant's recent entrance into the augmented reality headset market following the launch of its innovative Apple Vision Pro device."", 'Apple could also be on the verge of an enormous iPhone upgrade cycle. In September, analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that after more consumers chose to wait longer to buy a new phone in 2023, the average iPhone replacement period stood at an all-time high of 4.4 years. With many of these phones nearing the end of their useful lives, there could be enormous pent-up demand for the iPhone 16 due out later this year.', 'Additionally, in January, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan posited that forthcoming AI-powered features will boost iPhone sales in the coming years. Mohan expects the rising popularity of generative AI applications to drive demand for AI-enabled devices in 2024 and 2025, which should also help to support higher services revenue for Apple.', ""With these powerful growth drivers set to propel the tech leader's profit growth, Apple's stock is a solid buy today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Even though he's not as much a purist as he was in the past, Buffett remains a value investor at heart."", ""It's not surprising, therefore, that his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio includes quite a few stocks with attractive valuations. But one of them stands out more than any. Meet the most ridiculously cheap stock in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio."", ""Dialysis provider DaVita (NYSE: DVA) is the cheapest of the cheap among Buffett's stocks on one key valuation metric. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is only 0.45."", ""To be sure, Buffett owns other stocks with lower forward price-to-earnings ratios than DaVita's multiple of nearly 12.4x. For example, Ally Financial trades at close to 8.9 times forward earnings. Hewlett Packard is even more inexpensive with its forward P/E of a little over 8x. However, the PEG ratios of these stocks are well above DaVita's."", ""There are also a handful of stocks in Berkshire's portfolio with lower forward P/E multiples than DaVita for which financial technology and data company LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, doesn't currently have PEG values. I excluded those stocks from contention."", ""Why do I like the PEG ratio so much? It incorporates companies' growth prospects. LSEG's PEG ratios factor in five years of projected growth. Granted, analysts' growth expectations could be way off. However, using the PEG ratio helps weed out stocks that have low valuations based on their near-term growth but are more expensive looking farther into the future."", ""Why is DaVita's valuation so low? It's not because the stock has performed poorly. DaVita's share price has jumped more than 30% over the last 12 months. That's well above the gains delivered by the S&P 500 during the same period."", ""It's not because healthcare stocks, in general, are especially cheap, either. The average forward P/E for the healthcare sector is 19x, not much lower than the forward earnings multiple of nearly 20.8x for the overall S&P 500. (I used forward P/E values for comparison in this case, by the way, because PEGs by sector weren't available.)"", ""The primary reason behind DaVita's low PEG ratio is that Wall Street expects strong average earnings growth of more than 18% annually from the company over the next five years. In the U.S., kidney disease is the fastest-growing non-infectious disease. This is driving demand for dialysis services."", 'But what about the potential for drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound to slow the dialysis growth rate? That could perhaps occur over a long period of time -- 15 to 20 years or more. However, DaVita projects a minimal impact on dialysis growth over the next 10 years.', ""I think that many value investors will like DaVita. Even if analysts' growth projections are overly optimistic, the stock does appear to be trading at a discount. Income investors will have to look elsewhere, though. DaVita doesn't currently offer a dividend."", 'Some growth investors might be tempted to scoop up shares of DaVita. The overall trends related to kidney dialysis over the next decade seem to be favorable. My view, however, is that there are plenty of other stocks that offer even more compelling growth prospects.', ""Buffett seems to agree.

In its short-term energy outlook published on Feb. 6, the EIA said, ""Although we expect crude oil prices will rise into the mid-$80/barrel range in the coming months, we expect downward price pressures will emerge in 2Q24 as global oil inventories generally increase through the rest of our forecast."" But the EIA doesn\'t expect prices to fall by that much.', 'Its full-year Brent crude oil forecast is $82.42 per barrel in 2024 and $79.48 in 2025. If that forecast is even close to correct, a lot of U.S. exploration and production companies are going to do very, very well. Majors like Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) are two straightforward choices.', 'For investors looking for even higher yields, Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP)\xa0and household appliance company Whirpool (NYSE: WHR) are worth a look.', ""Here's why all four high-yield dividend stocks are worth buying now."", 'Daniel Foelber (Chevron/ExxonMobil): The modern-day oil major is catering to a different kind of investor than decades ago. After getting burned by downturn after downturn, not to mention the drastic underperformance of the energy sector relative to the market over the last decade, investors are demanding stability and surefire returns. In other words, better cost management, more resilience during downturns, less leverage on the balance sheet, and a stable and growing dividend.', 'Chevron and ExxonMobil have answered the call and are giving all of that (and then some) to shareholders. Both companies reported phenomenal results on Feb. 2 -- proving that they can thrive when Brent crude oil prices are around $80 per barrel.', 'Perhaps the simplest way to see how these businesses have improved is to look at their leverage, as evidenced by the debt-to-capital ratio and the total net long-term debt position.', 'As you can see in the chart, Chevron and Exxon have very little net debt. They are funding their operations, future investment, and sizable capital return programs (buybacks and dividends) with operating cash flow.', ""The test going forward will be to not overexpand. ExxonMobil's deal with Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron's deal with Hess look like smart long-term moves. And best of all, they were funded with stock, not cash."", ""If you tuned into the recent earnings calls, it's very clear that the management teams of both companies recognize they can't run these businesses like levered-up regional exploration and production companies, but rather, that investors in the oil patch gravitate toward the majors for their diversification across the value chain, their dividends, and their relative stability."", ""All told, it's been a wake-up call for Chevron, and to a larger extent Exxon, in recent years. Both companies are in a good spot. And as long as they don't start getting complacent and start over-levering again, these stocks should continue to be rock-solid passive income plays."", 'Scott Levine (Brookfield Renewable): While there are likely a variety of reasons why investors may be attracted to Chevron and ExxonMobil, one of them is likely the lower-risk nature of their businesses since they are industry leaders. The same thing can be said about Brookfield Renewable, which includes ample solar, wind, and energy storage assets in its portfolio. Providing investors with a supercharged 5.4% forward dividend yield, Brookfield Renewable is undeniably an appealing option for income investors at the moment.', ""Although high-yield dividend opportunities are compelling, savvy investors know they can also be risky. It's not uncommon for companies to sacrifice their financial well-being to placate investors with hefty distributions."", 'With regard to Brookfield Renewable, however, this is hardly the case. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in funds from operations (FFO), resulting in Brookfield Renewable generating a record $1.67 per share in funds from operations -- enough to cover the $1.35 it returned to investors in the form of dividends.', ""Besides the company's recent performance, the future looks bright as well. Brookfield Renewable plans on raising its distribution by about 5% to 9% annually, representing a circumspect approach since it forecast 10% FFO-per-unit growth from 2023 through 2028."", ""Lee Samaha (Whirlpool): As long as interest rates remain relatively high, the U.S. housing market will be under pressure, and as long as the housing market is under pressure, so will discretionary spending on Whirlpool's household appliances."", ""There's no way around that fact for Whirlpool investors. Indeed, management's outlook for 2024 is for flat like-for-like sales growth and flat earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin in 2023. Moreover, its sales momentum appears to be deteriorating as management was forced to pull forward promotional activity (at the expense of profit margins) to try to reduce inventory."", ""It's not a great outlook. Then again, that's why the stock trades at less than 8 times what Wall Street analysts have penciled in for earnings in 2024 and has a 6.3% dividend yield."", ""However, Whirlpool isn't just a deep-value stock; management is actively improving the underlying business. Around $800 million of costs were taken out in 2023, and management plans to take out an additional $300 million to $400 million in 2024."", ""In addition, Whirlpool is on track to combine its low-margin European business with a subsidiary of Arcelik in creating a new company, of which Whirlpool will own 25%. The deal will improve Whirlpool's overall margins and allow it to focus on its core U.S. market alongside growth markets like Latin America."", ""Meanwhile, if and when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Whirlpool's end markets will improve.

This indicates the need for more pipelines to send LNG to export terminals.', 'Fresh Investments Create Demand: The clean-burning nature and wide availability of natural gas across the United States are driving demand. At present 187 million Americans use natural gas. The distribution network will continue to transport natural gas to all parts of the United States. With five new LNG export terminals being developed in the United States, there should be increased demand for natural gas pipeline services to transfer the gas from production areas to these terminals.', 'Per the EIA, once completed, the five new LNG projects will increase the combined export capacity by 9.7 Bcf/d by 2025. Per Playbook.AGA.org, one residential customer signs up for natural gas service every minute and 80 businesses add natural gas service each day. As production and demand for natural gas increase, more pipelines will be required to safely transfer the commodity to end-users.', 'Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators.', 'However, in its last four meetings, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate, and there is a possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 would be a positive for utility operators who are planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Utility Gas Distribution industry — a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector — currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #169, which places it in the bottom 32% of the 250 Zacks industries.

To skip our detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', ""It's no secret that the global community today is facing one of the greatest challenges imaginable in the form of the global climate crisis. With global temperatures on the rise and emissions adding fuel to the fire, climate activists have been on the offensive, trying to call attention to the gravity of the climate crisis and what it may mean for future generations. In the midst of this growing concern regarding the planet and climate change, many businesses are attempting to push forward a renewable energy agenda, with investors taking note. As such, many renewable energy companies are beginning to occupy more of investors' portfolios than they ever did before, making this area of energy an important and increasingly popular space to keep an eye on."", 'An example of an increasingly popular renewable energy company comes in the form of Avangrid, Inc. (NYSE:AGR). This American company has just been recognized by JUST Capital in its JUST 100 Companies list - a list ranking the best corporate citizens of the US. Avangrid, Inc. (NYSE:AGR) has ranked first among utilities in the 2024 JUST 100 list, and number 12 overall. The company\'s CEO, Pedro Azagra Blazquez, joined CNBC\'s ""Squawk Box"" on February 7 to discuss Avangrid, Inc.\'s (NYSE:AGR) position in the renewable energy space and overarching trends within the sector. On being asked about the impact of government funding on the success of the renewable energy sector, Blazquez said the following:', '""Part of the development has to be helped, that already happens. But also, for part of the assets you do PPAs, you go straight to the market, you have customers, big customers, you know, people that you interview quite often, we have PPAs with them as well. So, you have a combination of just the market but also some help from the production point of view, for the major projects we are doing.""', 'On the hurdles faced by renewable energy companies in the industry these days, Blazquez made the following comments:', '""The first one is permitting. I mean, the amount of permitting you need, it takes years. It takes probably five, eight years, for an offshore wind park. It takes three, four, five years to do an offshore park of solar. The permitting is critical, so that\'s one of the issues. The second one is... what I would call litigation. I think in the US, everybody litigates. It\'s quite normal to have litigation for everything. That also delays the projects. So, from our point of view, it\'s not access to capital. It\'s just predictability and permitting. Regulation is key. If you change regulation every year, thing\'s will not work. If you have a predictable framework, then things will be invested, and you\'ll have reality in the assets.""', 'The importance of predictable regulations in the renewable energy space cannot be highlighted enough, as investors are pouring billions of dollars into the space. For such an inflow of capital to continue, predictability in regulation will be key, as Blazquez put it.', ""On January 18, Mark Carney, the Chairman of Brookfield Asset Management and United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, joined CNBC to discuss the scope of sustainability in investors' agendas this year. Here's what he had to say:"", '""It [sustainability] hasn\'t slipped down the agenda for investors. If you look at the growth in investment in clean energy, it grew by 50% last year, and not from a small base. In 2022, it was $1.2 trillion, so that means it got to $1.8 trillion dollars. That\'s almost twice as much investment as in conventional energy. So there\'s a huge surge in investment in clean energy, in EVs, in the whole supply chain.""', ""Carney later moved on to discuss the role Brookfield Asset Management is playing in the renewable energy space, and the importance of the US government placing a higher priority on clean energy. Here's what he had to say:"", '""Brookfield does a number of things but it\'s one of the biggest investors, developers of renewable energy around the world, and those are all economic decisions. And so when we look at new power around the world, and again, I\'m gonna appeal to the AI revolution that\'s just beginning, all of that demands clean energy alongside. For the data centers, for the compute, that comes with the AI explosion. Now, over 90% of the investment, the ads worldwide, were clean energy. That\'s the future, that\'s where the investment is, and that is not investment, whether it\'s wind, solar, batteries, that require subsidies. What\'s more at issue, more at risk, are the next phase of climate technologies. Think hydrogen, carbon capture, and storage, which are areas where the United States could world leaders. But if the US isn\'t world leaders in that, somebody else is going to be. And those countries are going to grab that market share, and the returns of that are going to be felt over following decades, long after whoever wins the next US presidential election.""', ""In light of the above, it's apparent that clean energy stocks such as\xa0General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) are going to be occupying a more important position in investing portfolios. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best renewable energy stocks to buy according to hedge funds.
