Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Verisk Surpasses Q1 EstimatesVerisk Analytics Inc. reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results.Adjusted earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) were $1.29 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% and our estimates by 10.3%. This was due to strong segmental revenue growth and core operating leverage. Adjusted earnings decreased 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues of $651.6 million surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.1% and our estimate by 3.4% but decreased 16% from the year-ago figure. The reduced top line can be correlated to the sale of the company’s environmental health and safety business (""3E"") and the Financial Services segment.Segment DetailsThe Insurance segment’s revenues grew 11.1% on a reported basis and 9.8% on an OCC basis in the first quarter.Underwriting and rating revenues saw an uptick of 10.7% to $460.5 million. Claim revenues increased to $191.1 million, indicating an increase of 12.1% on a year-over-year basis.With the Energy and Specialized Markets segment qualified as discontinued operations, no revenues were reported from the segment. Verisk Financial Services was sold in April 2022 and no revenues for the segment are accounted for.Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1% on a year-over-year basis to $340.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was at 52.2%, increasing 210 basis points from the year-ago figure.Net cash generated from operating activities was $365.3 million.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVerisk is part of the Zacks Business - Information Services industry.

However, decreasing trading revenues and elevated expenses are near-term headwinds.Supported by higher rates, Schwab’s net interest margin (NIM) is expected to improve in the quarters ahead. After slashing rates thrice in 2019, the central bank cut interest rates to near-zero in March 2020, which hurt the company’s margins. Nevertheless, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, SCHW’s margins are expected to no longer be under pressure. In 2022, NIM improved to 1.78%. We project NIM to improve to 2.12% in 2023, 2.36% in 2024 and to 2.98% in 2025.SCHW continues to benefit from aggressive efforts to increase its client base in advisory solutions. While the company’s advice solution revenues declined in the first quarter of 2023, the same witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2% over the last six years (2017-2022).The buyouts of USAA’s Investment Management Company, Wasmer, Schroeder &amp; Company, LLC and Motif’s technology and intellectual property helped diversify revenues. Although it lowered fees on certain advice solution products, revenues from the same increased as average client asset balances improved.As of Mar 31, 2023, Schwab had cash and cash equivalents of $49.2 billion and total debt of $72.7 billion. The company remains focused on maintaining a low-cost capital structure, which has been able to support its capital deployments. In January, it announced a 14% hike in its quarterly dividend, followed by one hike in July 2022. Although the company has paused share buybacks in 2023, it is expected to continue to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployments.However, continuously mounting expenses are expected to hurt SCHW’s bottom line. Expenses witnessed a CAGR of 16.8% over the last seven years (2016-2022), mainly due to a rise in compensation and benefit costs, and acquisitions. The uptrend persisted in the first quarter of 2023. An increase in costs associated with compensation and regulatory spending, as well as strategic buyouts, are expected to keep total expenses elevated. We project total expenses to witness a CAGR of 3.2% by 2025.Schwab’s trading revenues are expected to be under pressure in the near term, given the uncertain market conditions. While the company’s trading revenues witnessed a CAGR of 41.2% over the six-year period ended 2022, the same declined in 2022 and the first three months of 2023. It has been focusing on enhancing trading revenues by undertaking several initiatives, which, along with the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, are likely to result in some improvement in trading income. However, per our estimates, trading revenues are expected to decline 12.9% in 2023.In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 36.1% compared with the industry's 19.3% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBanks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can jump directly to 5 Best Retirement Communities in Florida Near the Beach. Retirement Communities in FloridaThe U.S. Census Bureau notes that the largest percentage of seniors in the United States is in Florida, making up 21% of the population. The sunshine state is a top retirement destination for retirees all around the globe. While there are plenty of amazing places to retire in Florida, many senior citizens are particularly interested retiring near the Floridian beaches. As of today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that more than 40% of the U.S. population resides in coastal counties.This number is only likely to grow as boomers retire by the millions, a phenomenon largely referred to as the baby boomer retirement wave. Health Place notes that summer and the beach can also be good for your health, a reasonable justification for retirees who wish to flock to the coast. The study finds that individuals who live near coastal areas have better physical and mental health than those who don’t.The migration dynamics of older Americans reveal the same patterns, and evidently, retirees are considering the sunshine state of Florida for their golden years. However, with the inflation looming and limited nest eggs, retiring near the coast in Florida may seem like a distant dream. As noted by Vanguard, Americans have only $141,542 saved up for retirement on average. Even worse, median retirement balances stand at $35,345.Smart retirees, however, are figuring out how to make it work. They know the best places in Florida where they can retire on a budget, have saved adequately throughout the years, and consider longevity planning. According to CNBC, retirees need to do more than build a comfortable nest egg for their retirement.Since there is a 50% chance that Americans aged 65 today may last till age 85, they should also consider how they will live in the old years, go about their daily tasks, and also their social circle. Many senior housing companies offer senior living options that can be considered. Affordable beachfront retirement communities, in particular, can offer a good social circle, an inexpensive lifestyle, and lots of amazing coastal experiences.Story continuesAccording to the U.S. News &amp; World Report, the top reasonable beach cities include Pensacola, Daytona Beach, and Fort Walton Beach. Latitude Margaritaville in Daytona Beach and Del Webb Subbridge in St. Cloud are two options to explore within these affordable locations.After an eventful day in the water, residents can fine dine in at the many restaurant chains in Florida, such as Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI). Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) has many fine-dining restaurant chains spread throughout the state that Floridians can enjoy. Some examples of restaurants by Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) include Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, amongst others. There are also Publix Super Market Chains, one of the state's biggest supermarket chains.Retirees particularly worried about hurricanes can also migrate to the Tampa Bay Area. The region is among the best places to retire in Florida without hurricanes, prticularly the communities in Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus Counties. Other safe cities include Lake City, Orlando, Kissimmee, and Sanford. All in all, Florida has loads of activities and ideal locations for retirees to spend their golden years the best way possible.Savings for a Beach RetirementThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) conducted a study that shows that Americans will need at least $1.7 million on average for a comfortable retirement. In this regard, CNBC notes that potential retirees need to start saving as early as their 20s. Retirees can plan and protect their futures by considering retirement annuities and life insurance products like those offered by Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (NYSE:FNF).For retirees looking for safe stocks, many Vanguard funds for retirement are recommended by retirement experts too. One such fund popular within the retirement communities online is Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund. This fund is for those planning to retire between 2058 and 2062.Other top retirement funds include Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF, Vanguard Growth and Income Fund, among others. Employees can also open retirement accounts with their employers, such as 401(k) plans offered by Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (NYSE:FNF), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and others.Other retirement plans offered by firms such as Merrill Edge, Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (NYSE:FNF), and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) include profit-sharing plans, defined contribution plans, traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and others. For large nest eggs, saving at least 15% of pre-tax income during the early years of your career is recommended.If you are nearing retirement and are looking for the best retirement communities near the beach, our list of top communities can help you decide.16 Best Retirement Communities in Florida Near the BeachPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyTo determine the 16 best retirement communities in Florida near the beach, we have used 5 (1,2,3,4,5) sources.

The project, which is expected to commence in 2026, will help Louisiana achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.Nucor uses a recycling-based production method to make cleaner steel. This means that Nucor’s steel mills generate about two-thirds less than the CO2 of extractive blast furnace steelmaking plants. The latest deal is crucial to Nucor’s decarbonization strategy and will result in some of the lowest embodied carbon DRI in North America.Nucor is one of the first steel companies to disclose its Scope 3 emission-reduction goals. The agreement improves Nucor’s position as a sustainability leader, and builds on its plan to produce steel and steel products with low embodied carbon.Oil and gas companies are getting actively involved in CCS projects, as it offers a transition pathway for the rapid and effective reduction of CO2 emissions beyond what can be achieved by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels. Thus, the use of CCS in reducing industrial emissions offers an excellent opportunity.ExxonMobil is one of the most hydrocarbon-focused companies among Western oil producers. Unlike its peers, the company has stayed away from renewable energy. ExxonMobil’s energy transition plan primarily focuses on reducing emissions within its operations.The deal shows ExxonMobil’s commitment to reducing emissions from hard-to-abate industries and marks an important step forward in its efforts to benefit from carbon burial. In 2022, the company launched a low-carbon business to address the growing urgency to reduce emissions.Price PerformanceShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

6,0ef19433-07da-33f4-8536-22dad54a4088,UNM,2023-06-03,5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-impressive-ev-114200621.html,1685706120,STORY,"['AIG', 'KOP', 'ENS', 'UNM']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.  American International Group, Inc. AIG, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, Koppers Holdings Inc. KOP and UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the seven stocks that passed the screen:American International Group is a leading global insurance organization, providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services.

(NASDAQ:QRVO)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-qorvo-190807477.html,1685732887,STORY,['QRVO'],"[Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$103 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$89.69. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Qorvo's current trading price of US$98.43 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Qorvo’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Qorvo Is Qorvo Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Qorvo today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $119.61, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Qorvo’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Qorvo look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Qorvo's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in QRVO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QRVO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Qorvo, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

8,437f5037-662a-3d73-bbcf-02acdd8a920f,QRVO,2023-06-03,Qorvo (QRVO) Up 4.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-qrvo-4-7-since-153141429.html,1685719901,STORY,['QRVO'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Qorvo (QRVO). Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qorvo due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Qorvo Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Top-Line Decline Y/YQorvo reported healthy fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the bottom and the top line surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite inventory-reduction efforts and several design wins, sluggish demand trends in the end markets and the underutilization of production capacity led to a top-line decline year over year.Net IncomeGAAP net loss in the reported quarter was $138.4 million or a loss of $1.39 per share against a net income of $212.3 million or $1.95 per share in the prior-year quarter. The steep decline was caused by lower net sales during the quarter.Non-GAAP earnings in the reported quarter were $25.7 million or 26 cents per share compared with $339.6 million or $3.12 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 14 cents.For fiscal 2023, Qorvo recorded a GAAP net income of $103.1 million or an income of $1 per share compared with $1,033.3 million or $9.26 per share in fiscal 2022.RevenuesQuarterly revenues declined to $632.7 million from $1,166.2 million owing to soft demand trends. However, the revenues exceeded the midpoint of the guidance. In spite of efforts to reduce channel inventory levels, end market weakness and underutilization of production capacity affected margins. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $621 million.In fiscal 2023, revenues aggregated $3,569.4 million compared with $4,645.7 million reported in fiscal 2022.Net sales in High-Performance Analog (HPA) were supported by modest growth in power devices and defense markets. In the HPA segment, the company secured significant design wins for various technologies, including multiple RF components and BAW-based multiplexers. The Power devices business gained from silicon carbide inverter orders for residential and industrial solar applications. Multiple design wins in aerospace, battery management, defense radar, electric vehicles and renewable energy systems boosted the sales growth from this segment.Revenues from Connectivity and Sensors Group were dented by inventory digestion and low demand for Wi-Fi enabled products and cellular IoT. However, strength in automotive connectivity, indoor navigation, smart home, sensor business, automotive smart interiors and enhanced human machine interfaces partially reversed this declining trend.In Advance Cellular, Qorvo's sequential expansion in Android revenue was driven by multiple design wins with several major smartphone players.Story continuesOther DetailsOn a GAAP basis, gross profit declined to $114.7 million from $570.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin declined to 41.3% from 52% reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was $33.8 million compared with $377.2 million in prior-year quarter. The decline was propelled by high restructuring related charges and stock-based compensation.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityAs of Mar 31, 2023, QRVO had $808.8 million in cash and cash equivalents with $2,048.1 million of long-term debt compared with respective tallies of $972.6 million and $2,047.1 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow at the end of the March quarter was $31.3 million, with a capital expenditure of $34 million.OutlookFor first-quarter fiscal 2024, management expects revenues in the range of $620-660 million. Despite weakness in end markets, management expects easing of channel inventory and multiple design wins will support the top line. Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated at 41.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share are likely to be in the vicinity of 15 cents. The company expects non-GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $10-12 million in the June quarter.For fiscal 2024, management expects revenues to be higher than fiscal 2023 levels with a non-GAAP gross margin of 44%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 29.17% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Qorvo has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Qorvo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Cintas Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.33bUS$1.57bUS$1.84bUS$1.98bUS$2.06bUS$2.22bUS$2.33bUS$2.42bUS$2.51bUS$2.58bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.91%Est @ 4.07%Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$23bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$37b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$482, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cintas as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.917. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CintasStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Commercial Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

But after it divested its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom, the number slipped to $100 billion in the year to Jan. 31, 2023.McKenna in April first announced the expectation of doubling Walmart's foreign GMV. She expressed continued confidence on Friday even as the International Monetary Fund revised down its global economic growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024, citing persistent inflation.Walmart's business model has evolved over the past few years, with a greater focus on omni-channel - a strategy that ties together its e-commerce business, delivery services, advertising and marketplace business. McKenna said Walmart's huge size and technological breadth will give it the leverage to scale this strategy more quickly.McKenna said she expects Walmart's growth to come from implementing the omni-channel strategy globally, scaling existing and new marketplaces in the 19 foreign countries in which it operates, and building a complementary business ""ecosystem"" like the one it has in Mexico.Story continuesBesides selling everyday products through brick-and-mortar stores in Mexico, Walmart offers financial services through its Cashi app, telecom services through BAIT and has now started offering healthcare services in the country.Walmart's omni-channel efforts have been a boon for the retailer as recession fears push more Americans to seek bargains in groceries. Inflation continues to be persistent in dry groceries, the company said. With more of family budgets being spent on food, Walmart and other retailers are rethinking how they price apparel, home and other discretionary products or are resorting to more discounts.To prod customers to open up their wallets, McMillon told reporters, the company will offer low prices for the upcoming back-to-school season. Walmart will be focused on low prices for notebooks or pens or pencils and will offer a lot more quantity and alternatives that shoppers can choose according to their budget, McMillon added.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

Dividend growers become top choices for investors, especially during bearish markets, because of their ability to generate stable cash flows and return profits to shareholders. When the market was down from December 1999 to March 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points per month, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend growth is one of the most important aspects of dividend investing. It is often associated with high-quality companies that have sustainable business models and solid financial health. In addition to this, companies with proven track records of dividend growth help protect during inflationary periods. For these reasons, investors often gravitate towards some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive.

It’s easy to get lured in by their charm, as the rock-bottom prices can be hard to resist.However, as the saying goes, “You get what you pay for,” and this rings true for some purchases made at dollar stores. GOBankingRates talked to retail experts to find out which purchases from dollar stores buyers almost always regret.MilkJulie Ramhold, a consumer analyst with DealNews.com, said milk is often a bad deal at Dollar Tree.“A 32-ounce carton of milk is $1.25, which works out to four cents per ounce,” Ramhold said. “But, if you shop at a store like Walmart, you can get a full gallon (128 ounces) for around $2.93 or so, which is two cents per ounce. In order to get a full gallon of milk from Dollar Tree, you’d have to buy four cartons and spend $5 for a gallon overall.”Not only is it a bad value, Ramhold said, but the milk is in shelf-stable cartons, which may mean you can’t find them in store and thus have to purchase them online, which means you’ll have to purchase a minimum of 12 for a cost of $15.For less expensive alternatives, generics are a good way to go and Walmart’s Great Value brand or Target’s Good &amp; Gather brand are both recognizable and much better deals.Take Our Poll: Who Has Given You the Best Money Advice You Have Ever Received?Electronic AccessoriesGiven that you’ve invested so much money in your electronic devices, it’s not always a great idea to trust a charger cord purchased from the Dollar Store.“It might seem like a great deal,” said Amy Weiher, founder and creative director at Weiher Creative, but she said it’s not. “You don’t know the manufacturer that produces the insanely cheap cords and you run the risk of zapping your phone or tablet.”Story continuesAndhi Ermawan, a professional product tester and the founder of MyProsAndCons.com, agreed.“A few years back, I picked up a pack of USB cables from a dollar store,” he said. “Can you imagine how fantastic it felt to get five cables for the price of one? But, fast-forward a few weeks and every single one had stopped working. Cheap manufacturing and low-quality materials meant they weren’t just a waste of a dollar; they were a waste of time. Better yet, they put my devices at risk of damage.”Name-Brand CerealAt Dollar Tree, you can find Honey Nut Cheerios and other varieties. However, according to Ramhold, these cereal pouches are priced at $1.25 each for a mere 3.5 ounces, which she considers a remarkably poor value.Crunching the numbers, that equates to 36 cents per ounce. However, a savvy shopper can head to Walmart and snag a 32-ounce resealable bag of the same cereal for just $6.77, amounting to a mere 21 cents per ounce.Not only does this alternative offer a more cost-effective solution, it also eliminates concerns about the cereal going stale, as you can store it conveniently or opt for resealable packaging. Ultimately, opting for the larger bag is a wiser choice that guarantees a better deal for your money.Cleaning ProductsAccording to Ermawan, purchasing cleaning supplies from the dollar store is not the best idea.“Once, in an effort to save some money, I opted for a generic window cleaner,” he said. “And let’s just say, it was more water than cleaner. The smears it left behind on my windows were a clear reminder that cheaper isn’t always better.”Instead, experts advise buying name-brand cleaning supplies in bulk from warehouse stores like Costco, where you can almost always get a good price.Pampa Strawberry Fruit Spread“This is an item I’d avoid altogether as it’s basically a sugar bomb,” Ramhold said. “The first two ingredients are sugar and water, followed by strawberry pulp, fruit pectin, artificial flavor, caramel color, sodium benzoate, distilled monoglyceride and red #40.” It’s a decent deal at 19 ounces for just $1.25, but the quality just isn’t there.For a better alternative, she recommended that consumers head to Walmart and purchase the Great Value Squeezable Strawberry Fruit Spread, which comes in a 20-ounce bottle. Although it’s priced slightly higher at $2.92, the ingredients are better.This product lists strawberries as the main ingredient, followed by corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup and sugar — indicating a sweeter taste. However, it also contains fruit pectin, citric acid, grape juice concentrate for color and natural flavor. Overall, the ingredient list is less concerning than that of the Pampa brand, even considering the sugar content.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Vote for Your Favorite3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Dollar Store Purchases Buyers Almost Always Regret]"

The acquiree adopts a systematic approach to gain an in-depth understanding of clients’ businesses and offers a detailed study of their risk profile.Thus, with the expertise of SOLV, MMA will be able to boost client service and data-driven insights thereby leading to the devising of advanced risk management strategies. This, in turn, is likely to equip MMA to cater more effectively to its client base. MMA remains quite active on the acquisition front that it hadstarted back in 2009. Since then, MMA has purchased over 100 agencies. Clark Insurance, CS Insurance Strategies, Steinberg &amp; Associates, McDonald-Zaring Insurance were some of the organizations that had been acquired by MMA last year.Such an active buyout strategy has boosted the capabilities of MMA, which in turn, is likely to boost commissions received in return for the company’s services. The sound performance of MMA usually adds strength to the performance of the Marsh sub-unit.Marsh and Guy Carpenter form part of the segment that usually contributes the most to the overall revenues of Marsh &amp; McLennan - Risk and Insurance Services. The segment accounted for 65.6% of MMC's total revenues in the first quarter of 2023.Acquisitions are one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan, which has helped it to expand product offerings, benefit customers and strengthen its global presence. Pursuing buyouts within its different operating units has enabled MMC to delve into new geographies, expand within the existing locations, explore new businesses and specialize within its current businesses. After expending $572 million on acquisitions in 2022, MMC remains quite active on the buyback front so far this year. It spent $263 million on buyouts in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesAnother recent buyout of MMC has been undertaken by the Guy Carpenter unit of Marsh. It has agreed to acquire an Israeli independent reinsurance broker, Re Solutions. This acquisition is expected to solidify Marsh &amp; McLennan’s presence across Israel.Shares of Marsh &amp; McLennan have gained 5.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 1.7% growth.

To see more of these stocks, you can take a look at the 5 Best Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Stocks to Buy.The past few years have been challenging for most industries, with a global pandemic on the loose followed by rising inflation and geopolitical tensions. Companies that have managed to adapt to the rapidly transforming economic environment have managed to hold on, while many others have struggled and been brought to the point of bankruptcy. Insurance companies have not been spared, being faced with macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. However, the industry has managed to remain strong through 2022 and well into 2023, according to several outlook reports on the global insurance industry for 2023.A Bright Future for the Insurance IndustryAccording to one such outlook report published by Deloitte in June, insurance companies that have managed to transition during the pandemic to be able to host remote workforces and virtual customer and distributor engagement seem to be well-positioned to profit in the face of the many challenges they are facing. It has been noted in the report that reliance on advanced technology and digital infrastructure will take insurance companies a long way in meeting their goals and turning a profit. However, they must also retain their creativity in adapting to the new environment while pledging their support to sustainability priorities like climate risk, diversity and inclusion, and social equity. In a market where customers and consumers are easily swayed by socioeconomic issues, most companies are beginning to have to deal with more socially aware and concerned customers. Hence, by focusing more on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, insurance companies can continue to retain their profitability in today's uncertain market.An example of ESG priorities having an impact on the insurance industry comes with the London insurance market. According to the Deloitte report, this market could double in size by covering the global transition to green energy for policyholders who want to achieve net zero carbon emissions. According to the London &amp; International Insurance Brokers' Association (LIIBA), by 2023, buyers around the world are expected to spend about $125 billion in insurance-related transition costs. This figure alone speaks volumes about the vast potential within the ESG space, which insurance companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), and Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) can harness and utilize for their growth.Story continuesThe Property and Casualty Insurance MarketAccording to another outlook report published by McKinsey &amp; Company in March, personal property and casualty insurance has seen an annual growth of 3% between 2019 and 2022. This growth was witnessed despite the sector slowing down during the pandemic. According to the report, in 2022, the insurance industry's gross written premium (GWP) crossed the $6.5 trillion mark, and about one-third of its total revenues were derived from property and casualty insurance. However, a quick study of this sector within the broader insurance industry shows that personal property and casualty insurance is restricted to a local level, requiring insurance companies within this space to maintain a strong presence within specific regions.According to the McKinsey report, the market for property and casualty insurance is concentrated and restricted to the top five insurers operating in the US. These companies thus claim 56% and 61% of the five-year growth and pre-tax income, respectively, while they make up only about 48% of the total market share within the property and casualty insurance space. However, this concentration is not limited to the US alone. The report shows that this trend is replicated across most geographical areas, including Italy, France, Japan, and many other countries.While this market concentration remains the reality for most regions when it comes to their personal property and casualty insurance sectors, it cannot be denied that this sector remains a strong and resilient part of their economies to date. Its continued growth and profitability have led to many investors continuing to pour investments into companies operating within this space. As such, we have compiled a list of the best property and casualty insurance stocks to buy today.Best Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Stocks to BuyAigars Reinholds/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 10 best property and casualty insurance stocks to buy.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 of the most popular property and casualty insurance stocks among elite hedge funds.

The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE:THG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE:THG) is a provider of property and casualty insurance products and services.

Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) is a diverse financial holding company based in Glen Allen, Virginia. It engages in marketing and underwriting specialty insurance products, including property and casualty insurance products.With one Buy rating placed on Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL), analysts on Wall Street see the stock as a Moderate Buy. They have placed an average price target of $1,600 on the shares, which were trading at $1,316.18 on May 25. This gives Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) an upside potential of 21.46%.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 23 hedge funds long Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL). Their total stake value was $1.1 billion.Investment management firm, Davis Advisers, mentioned the company in its 2022 annual investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“As the relative risk/reward trade-off has shifted back toward our bank holdings, the fund has reallocated some capital away from P&amp;C insurance, though it still remains a meaningful position at 17%. A closer look at one of those holdings, Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) Corporation, illustrates why. Referred to by some as a “mini-Berkshire Hathaway,” Markel allocates its capital between writing P&amp;C insurance, investing in publicly traded stocks, purchasing controlling interest in private companies and repurchasing its own stock. Such flexibility conveys an advantage over those who limit themselves to one or two of those options. It also complicates the analysis of the company by investors, and despite its $18 billion market capitalization, Markel is covered by relatively few brokerage analysts. Insurance companies in general earn two streams of profits: the profit (loss) from underwriting clients’ risks, and the investment income generated from assets financed with the float provided by their customers (and their own capital). Markel has a demonstrated record as a highly competent underwriter, illustrated by management’s targeted underwriting margin of 10% in the medium-term, an outcome that would translate into an attractive mid-teens return on equity if it were conventionally structured.But Markel is not conventional: It carries far more equity capital than its insurance operations need on a standalone basis, and that excess is allocated to stocks and owned private companies. Markel is projected to earn $1.25 billion of net income in 20236, but this metric only captures the dividends received on its $8 billion stock portfolio. The underlying companies in that portfolio—which include Berkshire Hathaway, Deere &amp; Co., Home Depot and Alphabet, among others—earn perhaps $350 million more than they pay out in dividends.7 Moreover, these companies are reinvesting much of that into their own businesses at attractive rates of return, which over time will materialize into stock price appreciation. Adjusting Markel’s reported earnings for these retained earnings would decrease its 2023 valuation multiple from 14 times to 11 times. Furthermore, the contribution to this adjusted measure of earnings from these stocks and from the approximate $2 billion invested in private companies is roughly 45% of the total. These are non-financial businesses that generally command higher valuation multiples than typical financial companies.…” (Click here to read the full text)6. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.

24,62d48dc5-fdaf-3c81-9812-b3c4301e8b68,MET,2023-06-03,Why Is MetLife (MET) Down 6.9% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-metlife-met-down-6-153125778.html,1685719885,STORY,['MET'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for MetLife (MET). Shares have lost about 6.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MetLife due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.MetLife Q1 Earnings Miss on Lower Investment IncomeMetLife reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted operating earnings of $1.52 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85. The bottom line declined 25% year over year and significantly missed our guidance.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $16,126 million, which decreased 7.7% year over year. The top line missed the consensus mark by 4.1% and our estimate of $16,306.6 million.The weak first-quarter results were caused by reduced returns, lower investment income despite a high interest rate environment and rising expenses. Reduced profit levels from Asia and MetLife Holdings businesses were concerning. The negatives were partially offset by volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S., EMEA and Latin America businesses.Behind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,541 million, up 3% year over year. Adjusted net investment income fell 8% year over year to $4,606 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to incurring variable investment loss stemming from decreased private equity returns.Total expenses of $15,131 million jumped from $13,470 million a year ago, despite lower policyholder benefits and claims, primarily due to incurring market risk benefit remeasurement losses. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 20%.Net income plunged 99% year over year to $14 million, due to net investment losses. Adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, deteriorated 440 bps year over year to 11.3%.Story continuesSegmental PerformancesU.S.: The segment reported adjusted earnings of $707 million, which increased 7% year over year in the first quarter due to higher volume, recurring interest margins and favorable underwriting, partly offset by reduced variable investment income. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2%. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT of $6,718 million, rose 4% year over year.Asia: Adjusted earnings in the segment amounted to $280 million, which fell 53% year over year in the quarter under review and missed the consensus mark by 25.6%, due to reduced variable investment income. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues declined 9% year over year to $1,794 million in the first quarter.Latin America: Adjusted earnings of $215 million increased 59% from a year ago and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.7%, due to volume growth, favorable underwriting and recurring investment margins, partially offset by reduced variable investment income. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues advanced 32% year over year to $1,372 million in the segment, due to growing sales.EMEA: The segment’s adjusted earnings were $60 million, which increased 9% at reported basis and 30% at cc basis year over year in the first quarter, on the back of growing volumes and recurring interest margins. However, it marginally missed the consensus mark. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues of $581 million declined 3% year over year. On a cc basis, the same was up 5% year over year due to sales growth.MetLife Holdings: Adjusted earnings in the segment slumped 55% year over year to $158 million due to decreased variable investment income. The reported figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 39.5%. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues fell 8% year over year to $959 million in the quarter under review.Corporate &amp; Other: Adjusted loss of $236 million widened from the prior-year quarter’s loss of $105 million.Financial Update (as of Mar 31, 2023)MetLife exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $18,456 million, which decreased from $20,195 million at 2022-end. Total assets of $674.3 billion increased from $663.1 billion in first-quarter 2022 end.Long-term debt totaled $14,622 million, marginally down from $14,647 million at 2022-end. It also had a short-term debt of $168 million. Total equity of $32,423 million increased from $30,125 million at 2022-end.Capital Deployment UpdateMetLife bought back shares worth $800 million during the first quarter and an additional $223 million in April.OutlookEarlier, the company stated that it expects pre-tax variable investment income to be around $2 billion for 2023. Corporate &amp; Other adjusted losses were expected within $650-$750 million for the year. The effective tax rate was projected in the range of 22-24%. MET expects its MetLife Holdings’ adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues to decline 12-14% in 2023 and then by 6-8% per annum. It expects to generate adjusted earnings of $1-$1.2 billion in 2023 from this segment.It stated that within three years, the company targets adjusted return on equity within 13-15%. It intends to keep free cash flows within the 65-75% range of adjusted earnings. Further, it is aiming at a direct expense ratio of 12.6%. In the near term, MET expects its group benefits’ adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues to grow 4-6% per annum.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, MetLife has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, MetLife has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMetLife is part of the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry. Over the past month, Prudential (PRU), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Prudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +77.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.Prudential has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

However, it's possible that Saudi Arabia brings a more assertive stance to the table this weekend in response to one key supply dynamic that's disrupting the cartel's plans to push prices higher.""The OPEC+ meeting on June 4 should be pivotal,"" investor Louis Nevallier wrote in a note on Friday. ""[R]ussia has been pumping increasing volumes of cheap heavy crude oil onto world markets, which has been undermining Saudi Arabia's efforts to boost prices."" Nevallier said that he expects a ""very assertive"" Saudi Arabia to show up to the meeting.Russia keeps flooding the marketRussia pledged in April to cut output by 500,000 barrels a day, but since then, there's been little evidence that crude flows have ebbed, and certain customers are buying more Russian crude than ever.

They're dragging prices below a key level needed for Saudi Arabia to fund big projects, and Riyadh is growing annoyed, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal this week.Story continuesThe report said the country's budget needs international oil prices to stay above $81 a barrel. Currently, Brent crude is hovering around $75.70 a barrel, and that's even after prices have gained in recent days as the US debt ceiling deal neared the finish line and US employment surprised to the upside in May.With prices under pressure, sources say it is possible that Saudi Arabia demands further cuts on Sunday. But Russia is unlikely to agree to that given its claim that it is already abiding by the voluntary move to slash output by 500,000 a day barrels earlier in the spring. It also badly needs the money, as energy exports are its biggest lifeline in funding its war on Ukraine.The June 4 meeting comes at the start of summer driving season for many countries, as well. In the US, gas prices rose about $0.03 per gallon over the Memorial Day weekend as Americans hit the road.After the previous round of OPEC cuts, analysts predicted that pain at the pump would be felt as the year went on with millions of barrels a day removed from the market. Any decision on supply this weekend could impact drivers for the rest of the year.In April, analysts said to brace for oil to spike to $100 a barrel on the last round of OPEC cuts.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

She noted that it earned $5.2 billion in revenue during 2022's second quarter and that “I’ll probably regret that at the end of the second quarter this year.""Pinto and Fraser became the latest of several big bank executives this week to warn about weakness on Wall Street after a rough start to the year.Most major banks that advise on mergers or IPO underwriting reported drops in fee revenue during the first quarter. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman Sachs (GS), followed by a 25% drop at Citigroup and a 20% drop at Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan saw investment banking revenue down 19%.Many of these banks decided to eliminate more positions this year, according to media reports.

It added Mexico in January 2022.Another part of the strategy is to take Banamex, its consumer bank in Mexico, public. It halted a plan to sell the unit, which is Mexico’s fourth largest bank.""I think it became pretty clear to us that the right route forward for our shareholders was to go down the dual path, down the IPO path, and we made that decision,"" Fraser said of the Banamex IPO.

Sales and trading revenues (excluding net DVA) were up 9% from the prior-year quarter. Fixed-income trading fees rose 29%, while equity trading income decreased 19%.However, total IB fees tanked 24.1%, reflecting the weak industry-wide performance of the underwriting business. Advisory fees plunged 28.7%.Over the past six months, shares of BAC have declined 19.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 11.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Bank of America carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesOur TakeThe current challenging economic environment has led to a persistent slowdown in the IB business. Factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession have acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions.Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers have crashed. For the same reasons, IPOs, follow-up equity issuances and bond issuances have dried up.Thus, similar to BofA, Morgan Stanley’s MS trading and IB outlook looks bleak for the near term.Per Morgan Stanley’s co-president, Andy Saperstein, the firm expects a year-over-year decline in its trading and IB revenues in the second quarter of 2023.Saperstein believes that because of a more challenging economic environment, Morgan Stanley’s sales and trading “results will be notably down year over year versus a strong second quarter last year,” while “investment banking is also very challenged.""Because of this challenging economic environment, Morgan Stanley has been compelled to reconsider its headcount. MS has been considering cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts that the company announced earlier.Similarly, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.Like MS and BAC, Citigroup C has been taking steps in its IB and wealth management divisions.This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, slashing hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.In its IB division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in deal-making. In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), has upgraded nine miles of a high-voltage power line in Carroll and Harrison counties in Ohio to strengthen the regional transmission system. The second phase of a larger 64-mile transmission line project, the rebuilt segment will enhance service reliability for Ohio Edison customers, improve system resiliency and accommodate increasing customer demand for electricity in the future.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The enhanced 138-kilovolt power line spans the Perry Township area of Carroll County and the Rumley Township and Archer Township areas of Harrison County. The approximately $50 million project involved replacing 57 wood pole structures with new steel structures and installing larger wires that can carry more electrical load. The larger wires can accommodate greater customer demand and the future connection of generation sources to the grid.""With these infrastructure upgrades, our transmission lines can better withstand the effects of severe weather, reducing the number of service interruptions experienced by customers in eastern Ohio,"" said Carl Bridenbaugh, FirstEnergy's vice president of Transmission. ""The work will also help advance development in the region to meet the growing demand for safe and reliable power for many years to come.""The segment was completed in late May and is the second in a series of projects that will rebuild 64 miles of transmission line over the next few years between a substation in Columbiana County and a substation in Belmont County, Ohio. The upgrade of the first 13-mile segment, located in the West Township area of Columbiana County and the August Township and Washington Township areas of Carroll County, was completed in January.The project is part of Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features. Through 2022, FirstEnergy has invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future initiative.Story continuesATSI provides transmission services in Ohio and in the western portion of Pennsylvania and owns or maintains more than 8,100 miles of transmission lines, substations and other facilities.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

However, stock dropped 7% upon the report owed to the fact that capital expenditures were higher than expected.Its shares are under pressure as customers are backing away from consulting deals with the software giant experiencing its slowest pace of growth in 13 years. Salesforce is another tech powerhouse that integrated AI tools into its business, but it is behind its rivals Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google.First Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended on April 30th, revenue amounted to $8.25 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus of $8.18 billion. But the revenue rise of 11% was overshadowed by a 36% rise in capital expenditures that amounted to $243 million, greatly topping by StreetAccount consensus of $205 million. The resulting net income amounted to $199 million, or 20 cents per share, rising from last year’s quarter when it amounted to $28 million, or 3 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.69 per share, below Refinitiv’s estimated of $1.61 per share.Second Quarter GuidanceAdjusted earnings were guided in the range between $1.89 and $1.90 per share on the back of a revenue range between $8.51 billion and $8.53 billion. Analysts gathered by Refinitiv guided for adjusted earnings of $1.70 on revenue of $8.49 billion.2024 ForecastWith the revenue forecast remaining intact, adjusted earnings were lifted compared to the guidance provided in March. They are now expected in the range between $7.41 and $7.43 per share on $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion in revenue. Refinitiv’s poll of analysts guided for a fiscal year revenue $34.65 billion with resulting adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share. As CEO Marc Benioff stated, with the operating margin for the quarter significantly exceeding the target, it is now called at 28% for the fiscal year, compared to 27% guided back in March.Story continuesChallengesChief Operating Officer Brian Millham noted the trend of clients taking longer to close deals and are looking at them more carefully. Also, professional service businesses are seeing a weakened demand for multiyear transformations as consumers are more interested on quick wins and strategies that bring value as soon as possible. In response, Salesforce is making efforts to automate the sales process and improve the productivity of its salespeople. Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver expects those issues to remain.The AI Race Against Microsoft And GoogleDuring the reported quarter, Salesforce revealed it is following Microsoft’s footsteps as it announced an AI tool its salespeople will use. Einstein GPT is a generative artificial intelligence technology designed to help salespeople, marketers and customer-service agents be more efficient at their jobs. Even the mighty Google got threatened by ChatGPT, as instead of “googling” questions on Google, one can just ask the ChatGPT. Although Google launched Bard AI in response, it was actually one of the first in the conversational game but it missed the boat by launching its own consumer product based on Lamda. Google is hoping to turn things around with Bard which is powered by the language model, but Microsoft is the one troubling Salesforce as besides AI tools, it is its main competitor with Dynamics 365. But, CEO Marc Benioff promises a revelation through Salesforce’s AI-enhanced products that will be added to one of the company’s most recently acquired assets, the messaging platform Slack.All in all, Salesforce reported a decent quarter with a profit rise of 68% year-to-date by the market close. With AI claimed to be the company’s biggest assets, Salesforce promises to be a worthy rival to Microsoft and Google in this arena.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The stock made a huge run up from 2011 to 2019, more than 10’xing over that time.Now that VRSN has had some time to cool off, and grow into its valuation, it should be ready for another bull run soon. Moreover, the presence of catalysts driving positive earnings revisions and an attractive valuation further contribute to the breakout potential.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewVRSN is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 32x, which is above the industry average of 30x, and below its five-year median of 37x.

The company, founded in 1981 and headquartered in France, offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative products and services that cater to various industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and life sciences.Dassault Systemes' flagship software, CATIA, is widely recognized as a leading design and modeling tool, while its other offerings, such as SOLIDWORKS and SIMULIA, provide advanced simulation and virtual testing capabilities.

Current quarter earnings have been upgraded by 11% and are expected to grow 7% YoY. FY23 earnings have been revised 9% higher and are expected to climb 9% YoY.Additionally, current quarter sales are expected to grow 8.8% YoY and FY23 sales are projected to grow 10% YoY. These are extremely steady numbers for a $60 billion company.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDASTY is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 37.5x, which is above the industry average, and in line with its 10-year median. Dassault Systemes clearly trades at a premium valuation; however, it is for good reason.Dassault Systemes’ applications are the leader in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) and Engineering software. It is estimated that it owns the largest share in the market at 17% and increased that share by 8.3% over the last year. DASTY has over 300,000 customers in more than 140 countries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThere is no doubt that Salesforce is a powerhouse in the stock market, but with the incredible run it has gone on, it may be time to look for value elsewhere.

(NYSE:CRM) Current Share Price Momentum?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-fundamentals-negative-impact-salesforce-130023235.html,1685710823,STORY,['CRM'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) stock increased significantly by 14% over the past three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Salesforce's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Salesforce How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:0.7% = US$379m ÷ US$57b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.01 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 0.7% ROEIt is quite clear that Salesforce's ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 11%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Salesforce over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Salesforce's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 20% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is CRM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether CRM is currently mispriced by the market.Is Salesforce Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. This makes us question why the company is retaining so much of its profits and still generating almost no growth? So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Salesforce. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Sealed Air's shares before the 8th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.80 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Sealed Air stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $39.72. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Sealed Air's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Sealed Air paying out a modest 29% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Sealed Air generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 31% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Sealed Air has grown its earnings rapidly, up 55% a year for the past five years. Sealed Air is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Sealed Air has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.4% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineIs Sealed Air worth buying for its dividend? Sealed Air has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Sealed Air is facing.

Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Oil due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marathon Oil Reports Better-Than-Expected Q1 EarningsMarathon Oil Corporation reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted net income per share of 67 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. The outperformance reflects higher domestic oil and gas production.However, the company’s bottom line fell from the year-ago adjusted profit of $1.02 due to weaker oil realizations in the United States and higher overall costs.The company reported revenues of $1.7 billion, which came 4.4% above the consensus mark but fell 4.2% from the year-ago sales of $1.8 billion.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, MRO executed $334 million in share repurchases in the first quarter.Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 396,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 345,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $425 million, down from $661 million in the year-ago period due to lower oil realizations and higher costs, partly offset by stronger production.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $74.69 per barrel were lower than the year-earlier level of $94.43. Additionally, natural gas liquids average price realizations decreased 35% to $24.27 a barrel. Finally, average realized natural gas prices plunged 38.4% year over year to $2.95 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $5.82 per BOE, representing a 4.1% year-over-year rise.Net production of 341,000 BOE/d was up 21.4% from first-quarter 2022. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 52% oil, or 176,000 barrels per day (bpd).Significantly higher year-over-year production from Eagle Ford favorably affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was partly offset by lower volumes from the Bakken area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 144,000 BOE/d, surging 80% from the level in first-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 94,000 BOE/d compared with 118,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Oklahoma output came in at 54,000 BOE/d, up from the year-ago level of 52,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $89 million compared with $115 million in the year-ago period due to lower output.Marathon reported production available for sale of 55,000 BOE/d, down from 64,000 Boe/d in first-quarter 2022.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $58.57 per barrel reflected a 1.8% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2022.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $1.1 billion, $127 million higher than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $942 million for the first quarter, down 26.4% from a year ago.As of Mar 31, 2023, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $178 million and long-term debt of 5.7 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 33.4.Marathon Oil spent $601 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $309 million in adjusted free cash flow.2023 GuidanceMarathon has maintained its budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and $2 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d, up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day. Assuming $80 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -10.42% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Marathon Oil has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerMarathon Oil is part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry. Over the past month, Antero Midstream Corporation (AM), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.Antero Midstream Corporation reported revenues of $259.48 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.8%. EPS of $0.21 for the same period compares with $0.19 a year ago.For the current quarter, Antero Midstream Corporation is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter.

To explore similar stocks, you can take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market.""The Winners Make No Sense""On May 9, CNBC's Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, dived into the current market dynamics to try and unravel the perplexing trends and developments we've been seeing unfold in the market so far in 2023. While bears have been whispering that a ""financial storm"" has been brewing and has ""snuck up on us,"" with a debt ceiling crisis and economic recession on the horizon, Cramer notes that the market still has not ""cratered."" Everyone seems to be confused about how the market has been ""hanging in there."" To deal with this confusion, Cramer went through several financial chart to try and spot what the ""strategists might be missing."" The answer he came to was that the stocks and sectors that have been rising seem to ""make no sense."" In fact, ""they aren't supposed to be on top all at once"" at all.Noting this perplexing phenomenon, Cramer then begins to go over various sectors and companies that had been performing well in May. While they included big-tech names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) alongside major drug companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), they also included industrials, housing, travel and leisure, and consumer packaged goods companies. With such a wide range of positively-performing sectors, especially those that are generally not up all together at the same time, Cramer began to break down what has been setting each sector apart in 2023, leading to its success.Cramer's Thoughts on Industrials and Housing StocksIn answering the question behind the success of industrials stocks even after the Fed has raised ""rates by 500 basis points in 14 months,"" Cramer noted that most leaders in this industry ""are involved in aerospace, or decarbonization, or both. He explained that the aerospace industry, being cyclical in nature and hosting ""so much pent up demand,"" is one of the key factors driving the growth being several industrials stocks. These include companies that are suppliers for ""Boeing or Air Bus, like General Electric.""Story continuesMoving on from industrials, Cramer delves deep into the housing industry and notes that historically, housing stocks ""should be at their 52-week-lows, not highs"" because ""when the Fed raises rates aggressively, these stocks are supposed to get hammered."" However, considering the ""tremendous housing shortage"" in the US, this industry has actually been incredibly successful so far in 2023. Homebuilders have also apparently ""raised prices by a gigantic amount, roughly 25% on average over the past two years."" According to Cramer, this trend has become pronounced in the housing industry because the rising demand for housing in the US has reduced the need for housing companies to offer lower prices to their customers.""Healthcare Is Running""Another industry whose success Cramer sees as an anomaly is the healthcare industry. Cramer noted that stocks operating in this sector are usually ""classic slow-down stocks that shouldn't be running at the same time as the industrials and the housing stocks,"" but this doesn't seem to be the case this year. The reason behind this development seems to be the ""new product cycles"" many drug companies are enjoying in 2023. There's also the ""emerging turn in medical devices"" as the pandemic has died down. According to Cramer, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals ""deferred non-urgent surgeries,"" so now, with the pandemic out of the way, demand for these surgeries and the devices required for them has ""come back with a vengeance.""""Pent-up demand"" is also the key factor behind the surprising success of travel and leisure stocks, according to Cramer. He noted that ""we're in a weird post-pandemic moment where everybody feels long on money and short on time."" This sense of urgency that many people in the US may feel best explains the perplexing case of the travel and leisure industry, which ""should be faltering at this stage"" but isn't.In short, Cramer helped explain the confusing market reality on his show by holding up a microscope to the performance of the companies in these industries. Considering these factors, we decided to cover the top stocks out of the ones Cramer mentioned on Mad Money.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we watched Jim Cramer's Mad Money episode from May 9, when the host gave a rundown on what stocks and sectors have been climbing the market so far in 2023. Cramer went through a range of names, including industrial companies, housing corporations, drug companies, consumer packaged goods stocks, and big tech. Of these names, we selected those that have been the most popular among hedge funds in 2023, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. We shortlisted the top ten based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, and ranked them using this metric, from the lowest to the highest number.Stocks Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks mentioned by Cramer in his ""big-cap tech"" stocks list. These were the stocks he believes have been confusing the market with their performance so far this year because they've been rising.As of June 2, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up 42.72% year-to-date.Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer raised his price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares from $800 to $900 on June 2. The analyst also has an Outperform rating on the stock.Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was spotted in the portfolios of 72 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value was $3.5 billion.The most prominent shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of the first quarter was Citadel Investment Group, holding 1.1 million shares in the company.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the quarter following the company’s solid fourth quarter 2022 results. This was driven by better-than-expected results in both its semiconductor solutions, networking and storage segments. The company also provided first quarter guidance that was ahead of consensus as well as 2023 commentary that expects earnings momentum to continue due to a strong product cycle.”9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72There were 72 hedge funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.According to Cramer, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a drug company that is offering ""diabetes drugs that could be revolutionary weight loss treatments."" Because of such products, the stock ""would be going up under a strong or weak economy.""Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is up 19.59% year-to-date as of June 2.On May 26, Wells Fargo analysts raised their price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) from $440 to $500 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Fred Alger Management made the following comment about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.”Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a stock that has performed well in the current market conditions.8. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73As of June 2, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is up by 11.06% year-to-date.An Outperform rating was held on Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shares on May 25 by Ambrish Srivastava at BMO Capital. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.Analog Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADI) in the first quarter. Their total stake value came up to $4.9 billion.Generation Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 5.1 million shares.Here's what  First Pacific Advisors said about Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock price declined in the first half of 2022, along with its semiconductor peers. That sector has since rebounded, lifting ADI with it. We believe ADI is a well-run company and a secular grower, which should augur well for its future. However, given that it operates in a cyclical industry, we will not be surprised when its shares periodically trade down.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Carter Gould, an analyst at Barclays, holds an Overweight rating on Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares as of May 1. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $128 to $130.All major drug names on the market, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), are ""enjoying new product cycles,"" according to Cramer. He believes this is driving their growth at the time.Over the past year, Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) was found among the 13F holdings of 75 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a stock that Cramer thinks has high potential.6. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a consumer packaged goods stock that has been surging because, like many others, its costs decreased ""while the prices stayed the same,"" according to Cramer.On April 26, Lauren Lieberman reiterated an Overweight rating on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shares while raising her price target on the stock from $160 to $167.Bridgewater Associates was the most prominent shareholder in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the first quarter, holding 4.9 million shares.

And so we've had risk-on environment now for weeks, and we've held critical support.So the question is, are we going to go into a bull market? I would say we're still very much in a trading range. We're just looking outside of the 2023 range so far by the fact that we've gotten over 4,200 in this high. But that doesn't mean it can't stop at, let's say, last August high at 4,300 or even go higher. The question is, are we really going to go into an economic growth or is this simply the sigh of relief that with all the bearish stuff that could have happened didn't happen and so people are coming back into the market.SEANA SMITH: Michel, if we do see the Fed actually raise rates here at their meeting in just under two weeks from now, is that going to be enough to halt some of this momentum that we are seeing in the market at least today?Story continuesMICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, I don't really necessarily believe that they will hike. I think as you guys were talking about in the very beginning, the labor report today was so mixed. And basically, you have the Fed funds rate and the CPI rate close together.And historically, May tends to be the peak in rates that they may actually either pause here or skip. And that could actually present a new round of problems with inflation as we get into the second half of the year. So the Fed may actually be-- even with 1/4% raise, I don't think they're going to do it. I mean, it's hard for me to fathom it right now.DIANE KING HALL: Michele, I just want to go back to-- you mentioned like stocks have been in this range. You call it this trading range that we're seeing. But today kind of paints a different picture. I mean, again, the S&amp;P 500 flirting with that 4292 level, which would be the breakout range. I mean, there's this phrase that they use on Wall Street, the trend is your friend. So you can't really-- I mean, can you fight this trend right now.MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, you're looking at the S&amp;P. But also, you have to look at the small caps here, right? So today was the first day that the Russell 2000 was able to get through 1800. Now, can it hold? I mean, that's really going to be a key right here.And it's almost like this flip to value and to some basic materials that have been beat up, to consumer staples that have been beat up, even the whole consumer space that really basically held major support but hasn't bounced that much remains the question in terms of what the S&amp;P and even the NASDAQ, which we exploded off of AI can do going forward.So I've got my eyes in there because that's really where you're going to get the picture, the real picture of what's happening in the US as far as growth in industrials, manufacturers, and what the consumers are going to do.SEANA SMITH: Michele, you just mentioned some of the movement that we've seen in the NASDAQ. A lot of that obviously coming from the rally that we've seen in so many of these AI names. And we take a look at the narrow market breadth. I think a lot of investors out there are trying to question or trying to figure out whether or not we have seen a top in the NASDAQ at least for now. What do you think?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, for now, possibly. It certainly seems that little tired. And the ratio got stretched between the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ stocks. And obviously the race into AI was prevalent and incredible, actually. But overall, it would be healthy to see a correction in NASDAQ. And we actually started to see a little bit red in the semiconductor space today, which I found really interesting.Because semis were part of the why we held on to even staying from dropping precipitously in the market over the last month or so. So SMH was leading then NASDAQ caught up, and you have stocks like Apple really going on there. But this question of 10 stocks leading the market, it's healthier if we pull back a little bit there and see the rotation into some of these areas. But that hasn't exactly been proven out because we've had this great one day rally today. We need more evidence.DIANE KING HALL: Right. We have had this great one day rally today, Michele. But again, you have these inflows into tech. You'd say 10. Bank of America put out a note talking about the magnificent seven. I mean, in terms of what's ahead for the summer, are we expecting to see more inflows in those these mega-cap tech stocks?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: It's very possible. Let's put it this way, these companies are leading the charge in AI. Will they get it saturated to some point? To a degree. I like to actually compare it almost to like Tesla in the EV space compared to all the other companies that are making EVs, right? Tesla is just the king. No doubt about it. You can see it reflected in the stock price compared to something like Ford.But that doesn't necessarily mean that Tesla will not come down and Ford will come up. And I think it's the same thing. Nvidia can sell off, maybe even Microsoft or Amazon or some of these companies that have really been leading the charge. But at the same time, you're seeing companies like match.com announce that they're using AI. And that's going to be the rub for AI is that it's really an everyday use that's being widespread and will be more and more adopted.So we could see some leadership change as far as how much Nvidia goes compared to, let's say, Advanced Micro Devices. But overall, that space will continue to grow over time. But remember, fundamentals and technicals don't always agree, right? So things get overdone, PE, and things can come off. And I still think we have to look at inflation. People have stopped talking about it. I'm still really focused on it.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Michele, you mentioned earlier just some of the new rounds of problems that we could potentially see with inflation. What more specifically are you anticipating or warning about over the coming months?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, there's a couple of things going on now that people should be paying attention to. One is Russia. Even though Ukraine has had some victories lately, Russia is talking about pulling back in terms of allowing ships to go into the Black Sea to export grain. And so we have mother nature on top of that, which is already put stress on a lot of the grain crops, even in the United States, but also in Australia and Brazil and China. So if you combine those two, that can spark another round of food inflation.With oil, we also have OPEC+ meeting this week. Could they cut back on supply more? It's possible. But oil has dropped, but it also held key support X factor. The dollar, BRICS. People think that Brexit is just a fantasy, but it seems the stories get stronger and stronger. Dollar's strong right now, but we have to keep our eyes there.And shipping and supply chain. Panama Canal today reported that the water levels are so low because of drought that they now have to reduce the weight that the ships are carrying, number one. And number two is the cost of the freight that's going through is rising. These are all things that can bubble up at any time. So I wouldn't get too complacent on the inflation front right now. Not to mention the precious metals have really held up pretty well, even if they've come off from the highs.DIANE KING HALL: I want to quickly just get back to oil. We're in really it looks like a risk-on environment today. You have both WTI and Brent crude up a little over 2% today. So what are you expecting out of OPEC? Are you expecting more production cuts? What are you looking for?MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Well, I actually think that-- well, there's a couple of other things, by the way. The Saudis are buying cheaper oil from Russia and then selling to the EU at higher prices. So it's kind of an arbitrage there. And maybe that will relax some of their need for that oil money. But it's very possible. Don't forget, they've been warning.They've been saying, bears, be careful because we're meeting. And they're not allowing any press into the meeting or at least not the big press release people like like a Bloomberg or a Reuters. So at this point now, I would say we have to watch price. It's always about price, right? That's what we've learned in this lesson now to this point.And now if we can get over $80 a barrel, particularly in the Brent crude, I think that means that whatever OPEC+ decides to do, we're starting to see constraints on supply. And everybody was discounting China as a big demand, but China is not exactly as bad a shape as people would like to think. China's very forward-thinking, and they could come back also and put a strain on that supply with higher demand.SEANA SMITH: And oil prices moving up just over 2% here ahead of this weekend's meeting. Michele Schneider, thanks so much. Have a great weekend.MICHELE SCHNEIDER: Thank you too.]"

However, stock dropped 7% upon the report owed to the fact that capital expenditures were higher than expected.Its shares are under pressure as customers are backing away from consulting deals with the software giant experiencing its slowest pace of growth in 13 years. Salesforce is another tech powerhouse that integrated AI tools into its business, but it is behind its rivals Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google.First Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended on April 30th, revenue amounted to $8.25 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus of $8.18 billion. But the revenue rise of 11% was overshadowed by a 36% rise in capital expenditures that amounted to $243 million, greatly topping by StreetAccount consensus of $205 million. The resulting net income amounted to $199 million, or 20 cents per share, rising from last year’s quarter when it amounted to $28 million, or 3 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $1.69 per share, below Refinitiv’s estimated of $1.61 per share.Second Quarter GuidanceAdjusted earnings were guided in the range between $1.89 and $1.90 per share on the back of a revenue range between $8.51 billion and $8.53 billion. Analysts gathered by Refinitiv guided for adjusted earnings of $1.70 on revenue of $8.49 billion.2024 ForecastWith the revenue forecast remaining intact, adjusted earnings were lifted compared to the guidance provided in March. They are now expected in the range between $7.41 and $7.43 per share on $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion in revenue. Refinitiv’s poll of analysts guided for a fiscal year revenue $34.65 billion with resulting adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share. As CEO Marc Benioff stated, with the operating margin for the quarter significantly exceeding the target, it is now called at 28% for the fiscal year, compared to 27% guided back in March.Story continuesChallengesChief Operating Officer Brian Millham noted the trend of clients taking longer to close deals and are looking at them more carefully. Also, professional service businesses are seeing a weakened demand for multiyear transformations as consumers are more interested on quick wins and strategies that bring value as soon as possible. In response, Salesforce is making efforts to automate the sales process and improve the productivity of its salespeople. Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver expects those issues to remain.The AI Race Against Microsoft And GoogleDuring the reported quarter, Salesforce revealed it is following Microsoft’s footsteps as it announced an AI tool its salespeople will use. Einstein GPT is a generative artificial intelligence technology designed to help salespeople, marketers and customer-service agents be more efficient at their jobs. Even the mighty Google got threatened by ChatGPT, as instead of “googling” questions on Google, one can just ask the ChatGPT. Although Google launched Bard AI in response, it was actually one of the first in the conversational game but it missed the boat by launching its own consumer product based on Lamda. Google is hoping to turn things around with Bard which is powered by the language model, but Microsoft is the one troubling Salesforce as besides AI tools, it is its main competitor with Dynamics 365. But, CEO Marc Benioff promises a revelation through Salesforce’s AI-enhanced products that will be added to one of the company’s most recently acquired assets, the messaging platform Slack.All in all, Salesforce reported a decent quarter with a profit rise of 68% year-to-date by the market close. With AI claimed to be the company’s biggest assets, Salesforce promises to be a worthy rival to Microsoft and Google in this arena.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Yet, a fluctuating weak U.S. macroeconomic environment might hamper the company’s margin. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Walgreens Boots has outperformed the industry. The stock has lost 29.8% compared with the industry’s 30.1% decline.Walgreens Boots exited second-quarter fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s U.S. Healthcare business expanded, led by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution.The company continues to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, having administered 2.4 million vaccinations in the reported quarter. It reinstated its 2023 earnings per share guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.The intensifying competition in the U.S. pharmacy retail drugstore market has compelled Walgreens Boots to diversify its product offerings through new partnerships.In April 2023, Walgreens entered into a partnership with Dublin-based biotech company, Prothena Corporation. The collaboration aims to accelerate patient identification and recruitment for Prothena’s ongoing ASCENT-2 multiple ascending dose clinical trial.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

In March 2023, Walgreens, in partnership with DoorDash and Uber, announced free, same-day Rx delivery of medications for the prevention and treatment of HIV.On the flip side, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Pharmacy sales were affected by a 3.5% headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. The International segment was also impacted by an adverse currency impact of 7.5% in the second quarter.Story continuesMoreover, in the last few years, a slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots’ margins. In addition, of late, increased reimbursement pressure and generic drug cost inflation have been hampering Walgreens’ margin significantly.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit fell 8.5% year over year. Gross margin contracted 260 bps to 20.2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 5.6%.Added to this, Walgreens Boots faces headwinds in the form of increased competition and tough industry conditions. Even though the company continues to grab market share from other traditional drugstore retailers, major mass merchants such as Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses and enjoying a fair market share. Notably, the retail wing of CVS Caremark witnessed a record market share gain following the termination of the Walgreens-Express Scripts contract.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Haemonetics HAE, Lantheus LNTH and Neuronetics STIM.

(NASDAQ:XEL) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Xcel Energy Is Xcel Energy Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$331.0m-US$1.70b-US$1.69bUS$53.0mUS$935.0mUS$1.52bUS$2.19bUS$2.88bUS$3.54bUS$4.13bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 62.39%Est @ 44.31%Est @ 31.65%Est @ 22.79%Est @ 16.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$310-US$1.5k-US$1.4kUS$40.6US$671US$1.0kUS$1.4kUS$1.7kUS$1.9kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.3bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$89bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$89b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$46bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$52b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.6, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xcel Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Xcel EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Xcel Energy, there are three fundamental factors you should assess:Risks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Xcel Energy (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does XEL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

She noted that it earned $5.2 billion in revenue during 2022's second quarter and that “I’ll probably regret that at the end of the second quarter this year.""Pinto and Fraser became the latest of several big bank executives this week to warn about weakness on Wall Street after a rough start to the year.Most major banks that advise on mergers or IPO underwriting reported drops in fee revenue during the first quarter. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman Sachs (GS), followed by a 25% drop at Citigroup and a 20% drop at Bank of America (BAC). JPMorgan saw investment banking revenue down 19%.Many of these banks decided to eliminate more positions this year, according to media reports.

Citigroup and Bank of America are making smaller reductions of a few hundred jobs each.Goldman Sachs Chief Operating Officer John Waldron said Thursday the bank is planning for a total of $1 billion in expense cuts, including new layoffs. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said his bank's investment banking fees are flat, though it has gained market share.Story continues“The good news is it's not moving around down much. It's just sort of bumping along that level,” said Moynihan, who pointed out the bank has been able to keep employee reductions low by redeploying workers into other areas for the bank.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser.

It added Mexico in January 2022.Another part of the strategy is to take Banamex, its consumer bank in Mexico, public. It halted a plan to sell the unit, which is Mexico’s fourth largest bank.""I think it became pretty clear to us that the right route forward for our shareholders was to go down the dual path, down the IPO path, and we made that decision,"" Fraser said of the Banamex IPO.

Customers have struggled for weeks to retrieve amounts as high as $100,000 stranded in Apple Savings accounts, according to the Wall Street Journal.The explanation for the delays is reasonable – at least, by the bizarre standards of the traditional finance system. In many cases the frozen funds were under “security review” – that is, Goldman is making sure its depositors aren’t engaged in criminal money laundering.This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The absurdity of this is layered and nuanced, like a souffle of clumsy, anti-customer banking practices. One trigger for such a bank security review, you see, is making a large deposit into a new account. But Apple has been heavily marketing the above-average interest rate on its savings service (4.15%), so it shouldn’t be a surprise people are depositing large amounts – which is also kind of what normal people do with a savings account already? And the savings service was only launched a few weeks ago, so all of the accounts are new.In other words, if you followed Apple’s marketing cues and opened a big new savings account managed by Goldman, the default assumption baked into the system appears to be that you are a money launderer whose funds must be frozen immediately and indefinitely.This becomes even more of a dystopian nightmare when you look at the specific people targeted by Goldman’s hamfisted anti-money laundering effort.One victim who spoke to the Journal was Antonio Sanchez, a Grammy-winning musician who has collaborated with Dave Matthews and Trent Reznor. This is a person who a quick Google search and phone call could easily have determined is unlikely to be a money launderer. But instead Sanchez, like the other customers profiled, wound up fighting through a Kafkaesque customer service maze for weeks, trying to pry loose a frozen $100,000 intended for a down payment on a house. Sanchez wound up having to borrow money from his mother-in-law: truly, a nightmare beyond nightmares.Story continuesAnd if you’re not a Grammy winner? Well, that’s certainly not going to improve how you’re treated. The one solution that worked for a few of the profiled customers was ... getting the Wall Street Journal to call Goldman about their issues. That customer service solution is not available to most of us.Goldman Sachs is not a retail-focused bank, and has struggled acutely with its efforts to serve smaller customers. But the incident also tracks a larger shift in traditional banking away from any kind of meaningful customer service, towards an increasingly automated, disinterested and even hostile approach to its piddling retail depositors.See also: Fractional Reserve Banking Is a Fraud (but It's Genius) | OpinionWhat makes this anti-customer bias truly toxic, though, is that it’s combined with an utterly opaque anti-money laundering regime that seems to have uncontested effective control over every bank deposit in the United States. Make one wrong move – something that looks even vaguely suspicious to a mute algorithm or an underpaid data analyst – and suddenly your property is “under review,” until they say otherwise.That suspicious activity apparently now includes “opening a bank account” and “depositing money in it.”So ask yourself this. When your bank doesn’t care who you are, and has the power to freeze your funds any time, without explanation, for an indefinite period … is that money really yours at all?]"

As a pure front-end play, Nova has the highest margins relative to Onto and Camtek, the analyst told investors in a research note.Story continuesWhere Does NVMI Fit In the Semi/AI Ecology?Metrology is the science of measurement and nowhere is precision more needed than in the ""nanosphere"" of chip manufacture. A nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter, and this is the distance of measurement for engineering transistors onto an integrated circuit (IC) board or card.Chips have been plunging below 10nm for the past few years as Moore's Law gets new life from GPU pioneers like NVIDIA. For comparison, the coronavirus is about 50nm.I explained some of this in my Top Stock Picks video about Nova on Tuesday, where I also suggested that this little engineer of Semi precision and purity may be an acquisition target for larger wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research or KLA.For less than $10 billion, any of these $50-100 billion Semi engineers could ""bolt-on"" Nova and secure their dominance in precision purity manufacturing.You Can't Spell Innovation Sans NOVABe sure to watch the video I made Tuesday (link here) to see inside the world of precision Semi manufacture.Until you do, here was a recent press release from NOVA that highlights their expertise...Rehovot, Israel, December 20, 2022 – Nova (Nasdaq: NVMI) announced today that a leading global logic manufacturer recently selected Nova ELIPSON™ for next-generation integrated circuit (IC) development.Nova ELIPSON™ was chosen for its ability to perform in-die characterization of stress, strain, and defectivity in next-generation devices, rapidly and with unparalleled sensitivity. The solution utilizes advanced Raman spectroscopy technology to extract materials properties of in-die structures, by fast and non-destructive means. The platform has consistently proven its ability to solve a wide range of materials metrology challenges in various segments and steps.“This selection by one of the world’s leading semiconductor logic manufacturers demonstrates the growing value of Nova’s innovative materials metrology portfolio,” stated Eitan Oppenhaim, Nova’s president and CEO. “The increasing complexity of device architecture demands solutions that push the envelope and address the unique challenges our customers are facing. In this complex process fabrication environment, Nova’s unique materials portfolio is becoming critical to the successful manufacturing of next-generation devices.”This is one example of how sales growth is returning for this small player in the $10 trillion market for AI.Disclosure: I own shares of NVMI, NVDA, and CDNS for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Bear of the Day:Micron Technology (MU) became a Zacks #5 Rank this spring as EPS estimates collapsed for the current fiscal year, which ends in August, from a loss of $2.28 to a loss of $4.71.That earnings drawdown would represent a 156% annual decline for the ""megalodon of memory"" if it unfolds as projected.What many investors don't realize is how integral Micron memory innovations are to the AI revolution across multiple platforms including mobile, autos, medicine, robotics and the datacenter.Besides the traditional volatility of commoditized memory chips and supply chain constraints, which delivered a 189% EPS miss for the February quarter, Micron has been dealing with higher pressure from China.Sales restrictions on Micron's products in China can be seen as a retaliatory action by the red state against the U.S. government's increasing restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology.Here's an excerpt from our May 22 reporting...Micron Faces Restrictions for Selling Products in ChinaMicron has been imposed with a trade restriction by the Cyberspace Administration of China on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. In a statement, China’s cybersecurity regulator revealed that the U.S.-based memory chipmaker has failed to pass a cybersecurity review, which it had initiated in late March 2023.The development can be seen as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government against the U.S. government’s increasing restrictions on Chinese access to critical and more advanced semiconductor technology.In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, the Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.The tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.In late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.The memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.But MU is not the only semiconductor company that has been impacted by the tech war between the world’s two largest economies.On Aug 31, 2022, NVIDIA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.The new licensing requirements will also be implied for any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will fall under export restrictions.Bottom line: MU appears a strong value near $65 as it trades under 4X forward sales projections of $20 billion. We just need to see how this cycle plays out with new pressure from China. The Zacks Rank will let you know.Additional content:3 Stocks to Buy for the Long TermMost investors have heard and read about Warren Buffett and his successful strategy of investing for the long term. And most also know how unnerving it gets when your holdings drop in value even as you patiently look to the horizon. Therefore, no matter how rewarding it may ultimately turn out to be, this game is not for everyone.But just suppose you were one of these patient folks: how should you go about doing this? What are the basic steps to follow or things to keep in mind?First, do your research. This includes looking at the company's financial statements, reading analyst reports and following news about the company. The goal is to have a clear understanding about the company's business model, industry position, financial performance, competitive advantages and growth prospects.Second, evaluate the financial health. Examine the company's financial statements, checking for things like revenue growth, profitability, debt levels and cash flow. Look for consistent revenue and earnings growth, a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow generation.Third, consider industry trends. Analyze the industry's growth potential, competitive landscape and any potential risks or challenges. Look for industries with favorable long-term prospects and companies that are well-positioned within those industries.Fourth, assess the stock's valuation relative to its intrinsic value. You could use valuation metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, or discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Look for stocks that are trading at a reasonable or discounted valuation compared to their potential.Fifth, diversify. The importance of a diverse portfolio can't be overstressed. Your portfolio should be balanced across growth profiles and risk profiles; between steady, mature industries and fast growing industries. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of any individual stock's performance on your overall portfolio.Sixth, rebalance your portfolio. Just because you’re holding stocks for the long term doesn’t mean that you stop monitoring and reviewing. You must make adjustments when things play out differently from what you were expecting. Also, you may need to sell a few stocks for your cash needs and compensate with other purchases. It’s important to follow closely all developments related to the stocks you’re holding. Rebalancing your portfolio helps you stay in touch with your long-term investment objectives.Finally, don't panic-sell. The stock market is volatile and there will be times when the market takes a downturn. It's important to stay calm. If you sell your stocks when the market is down, you're likely to lock in your losses. Patience pays, as long as the long-term investment story remains.Here’s a quick formula to evaluate long-term holdings:Using the Zacks stock ranking system, identify #1 (Strong Buy) rated stocks. Check their performance over the last few years. Ideally, you should be looking at revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. But a good average earnings growth rate (say at least 10%) could serve as a proxy. Add to this the analyst- expected growth rate for the next 3-5 years (if the growth rate is at least same as in the last 3-5 years, it’s an indication of steady growth for a prolonged period of time). So we can keep this too at a minimum of 10%. If such a company also pays a dividend, all the better.One stock that passes all these tests is Graco Inc. This provider of equipment and systems used to measure, move, control, spray and dispense fluid and powder materials supplies industrial manufacturers.The reason it looks so good now is that it has a five-year historical record of 10.6% earnings growth. Analysts expect the company to grow its earnings by 10% on average in the next 3-5 years, And in the current year, it is expected to grow 16.2%. It also pays a small dividend that yields 1.23%.Another stock on this list is Lifetime Brands, Inc., which is known for its kitchenware, tableware and other household products.The company has seen earnings growth of 54.9% in the last five years and is expected to grow at 14.0% over the next five years. This year alone it will grow 93.6%. To top it all, its dividend yields a very decent 3.47%.Similarly, American International Group, Inc., which offers insurance products for commercial, institutional and individual customers primarily in North America, has grown 30.5% in the last five years and is expected to grow 10.0% in the next five. It is currently expected to grow 44.6% this year. Its dividend yields 2.42%.All of these stocks carry a Zacks #1 rank, indicating upside potential even in the near term.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

70,6ac5a58c-72d2-3b80-ad2e-6fed089ac4a3,AIG,2023-06-03,5 Low Price-to-Sales Stocks That Can Uplift Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-price-sales-stocks-115900055.html,1685707140,STORY,"['AIG', 'MT', 'PAM', 'PAGS']","[Investment in stocks after the analysis of the valuation metrics is considered one of the best practices. When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profit.What’s Price-to-Sales Ratio?While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. Therefore, a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Barnes Group Inc. B, American International Group AIG, ArcelorMittal MT, PagSeguro Digital PAGS and Pampa Energia S.A. PAM are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening:Barnes is a global diversified manufacturer and provider of highly engineered products, innovative solutions, and differentiated industrial technologies.

71,0ef19433-07da-33f4-8536-22dad54a4088,AIG,2023-06-03,5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-impressive-ev-114200621.html,1685706120,STORY,"['AIG', 'KOP', 'ENS', 'UNM']","[The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation.  American International Group, Inc. AIG, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, Koppers Holdings Inc. KOP and UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.  EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are our five picks out of the seven stocks that passed the screen:American International Group is a leading global insurance organization, providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services.

ILMN recently unveiled new PrimateAI-3D — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm which identifies disease-causing genetic mutations in patients. PrimateAI-3D will be made broadly available to the genomics community integrated across Illumina Connected Software.The National Institutes of Health estimate that the annual production of genomic data is reaching 40 billion gigabytes. To make discoveries that will expand knowledge of human health and promote precision medicine, it is essential to be able to share, analyse and interpret genetic data.The latest development will fortify Illumina’s goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing market globally.More on PrimateAI-3DMillions of genetic variations exist in each individual, which contribute to individual variances in health and illness risk. However, the majority of these variations are unknown in function. PrimateAI-3D solves a crucial issue that prevents the successful use of personalized genomic medicine by highlighting disease-causing variations with unmatched accuracy.PrimateAI-3D uses deep neural network designs like ChatGPT and AlphaFold to attain its cutting-edge performance. It is trained on genomic sequences rather than human language.The outcome is a deep neural network that can identify disease-causing variants with higher accuracy in all six clinical cohorts examined and generate personalized predictions of genetic disease risk that have been verified in a cohort of nearly half a million individuals.PrimateAI-3D – Unlocking New PotentialPrimateAI-3D's integration of cutting-edge AI technology with the most sophisticated DNA sequencing capabilities is fascinating. The vital work being done to improve patient care might be tremendously accelerated if physicians and researchers were assisted in handling the enormous genetic data that is being generated from the company’s platforms.A vital step towards the equitable application of genetic-based precision medicine for diverse, non-European populations, PrimateAI-3D also significantly increased the accuracy of genetic risk prediction, enabling the first demonstration of polygenic risk scores that were largely unaffected by ancestry bias.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBy unravelling the causes of complex genetic disorders like diabetes, heart disease and autoimmune diseases, the application of the most recent advancements in AI to genomics provides noteworthy prospects for Illumina in genetic risk prediction and medication target identification.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global genomics market size was valued at $28.1 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.5% up to 2030.Given the market potential, Illumina latest development is well-timed.Recent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Illumina collaborated with African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) to develop a training academy. The collaboration is intended to increase Africa’s genomics capacity. The collaboration is built on the organizations’ shared goals to expand sequencing capabilities and capacity for all people in Africa. It will impact every area of precision medicine, from drug development to cancer screening, therapy selection and monitoring.In April 2023, Illumina partnered with the Detroit-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization, Henry Ford Health, to assess the impact of comprehensive genomic testing on cardiovascular disease. A series of implementation and clinical studies will be conducted at The Lisa and Christopher Jeffries Center for Precision Medicine and the Center for Individualized and Genomic Medicine Research at Henry Ford Health.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of the company have declined 14.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 5.4%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIllumina currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism, led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its product development activities, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and production bottlenecks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 152.7% compared with 1% growth of the industry and the 3.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $3.21 billion. The company projects 10.1% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and broke even in the other two, the average surprise being 3.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. On its first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, PacBio’s management stated that the Revio system had been reviving legacy PacBio customers' interest in leveraging long-reads.

From dry cleaners to restaurants and even the real estate sector, the work stoppage from 11,500 writers has jolted businesses that rely on income from the industry to make a living.And a prolonged strike threatens to spread the impact beyond the region.“With the increase in different kinds of filmed productions due to all of the new demand from streaming and film incentives being a great deal more robust now than they were in the last strike, the overall impact of the strike will be felt in places like Georgia, New York, and elsewhere in ways that it was more confined to California last time,” said Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute.Workers and supporters of the Writers Guild of America protest outside Warner Bros. Studios after union negotiators called a strike for film and television writers, in Burbank, California, U.S., May 2, 2023. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni (Mario Anzuoni / reuters)A 'longer, colder' strikeIn North Hollywood, where Pam and Jim Elyea own a prop house called History for Hire, history feels like it’s repeating itself.Their business has supplied props to movie productions for nearly 40 years, including the cameras for Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” and military gear for “Platoon.” The last time the WGA went on strike in 2007, the Elyeas delayed buying their own warehouse, using the money saved up to keep the business afloat instead.Pam Elyea said this strike feels “longer, colder.”“There's not a lot of other options for us,"" she said. ""So what we do during this time when we're shut down is we work on our stock, we maintain it, but every week we're losing money. Every month we're losing money on this. And we really estimate the strike will at least go on to the end of September, possibly the end of the year.”If the last writers' strike, which began in 2007 and ended in 2008, is any indication, a prolonged strike is likely to result in significant job losses and weigh on the region’s growth. The 100-day strike contributed to 37,700 job cuts and $2.1 billion in losses, according to a Milken Institute study conducted by Klowden. That accelerated the onset of California’s recession in 2008 in the midst of the subprime mortgage crisis that triggered the global financial crisis.Story continuesNearly a month into the current strike, a growing list of shows and films have already halted production. But it’s too early to say what the full impact will be, Klowden said.“The secondary effect of the strike can often be delayed,” he said. “A number of those businesses were already hit hard by the pandemic, and an extended strike might force them to close down entirely.”'There are terrible costs'The proliferation of streaming services is at the core of the strike. Chris Keyser, co-chair of WGA’s Negotiating Committee, said tech companies such as Netflix (NFLX) have fundamentally altered the way in which writers are paid, employing them for “the fewest amount of weeks, for the least amount of money they can pay” while maximizing output.“A bunch of tech companies came in during the streaming era and imposed a kind of efficiency and productivity onto the creative process that doesn’t make any sense,” Keyser said. “They pay us by the week and say, give us your great idea and go home. Doesn’t work anymore.”Striking writers rally in front of Netflix offices, Wednesday, May 3, 2023, in Los Angeles. Television and movie writers launched a strike Tuesday in a fight over fair pay in the streaming era. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Writers are seeking increases in minimum pay, along with better residuals, which are similar to royalty payments, from streaming services. They’re also calling for strict limits on any content produced by artificial intelligence.Keyser said AMPTP has yet to come to the table on key issues to compensate writers fairly, even as Hollywood studios rack up profits.“If we don’t negotiate for this now, when we come back in three years, it may be too late,” Keyser said. “Yes, there are costs to it. There are terrible costs. We are painfully aware of those costs. The companies should come back and talk to us.”In a statement to Yahoo Finance, the AMPTP said: “Member companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods.”Stalled negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild, which has already authorized a strike, and the Directors Guild of America, which has yet to reach its own deal with the AMPTP, may complicate the timeline for any resolution.Danny Tolli, a veteran writer and strike captain, said he’s hanging on to two additional jobs unrelated to the studios in preparation for the long haul.“I'm facing some financial hardships, but it's important to be out here,” he said from outside the Netflix building on Sunset Boulevard. “Given where I was before the strike, it wasn't a dangerous gamble to go on strike. I was already seeing my career as a writer evaporate. I knew that this was important.”Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A similar letter was sent to Comcast (CMCSA), the parent company of NBCUniversal, ahead of its annual shareholder meeting next week.According to the proposal, Sarandos' 2023 pay package would include up to $40 million in base salary, coupled with performance bonuses and stock options. Peters, who was named co-CEO earlier this year after Reed Hastings stepped down from the position, would receive up to $34.6 million.Hastings, who now serves as Netflix's executive chairman, would earn about $3 million for the year.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 11: (L-R) Netflix Co-Ceo Ted Sarandos, Netflix Film Chairman Scott Stuber, and Netflix Co-Ceo Greg Peters attend the Netflix Oscar Nominee Celebration at Sunset Tower Hotel on March 11, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

It’s clear that investors don't believe this management team is worth $160+ million a year,"" the WGA continued, adding: ""Netflix’s board needs to spend less time thinking up ways to pay its executive team more money and instead address the writers' strike that is delaying major shows like 'Stranger Things.'""Hollywood writers began a strike on May 2 in protest of higher wages and other demands amid the streaming boom. That set off a production shutdown across the entire industry.Story continuesThe WGA had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Sony.Moody's has warned that some media companies could see credit ratings suffer as a result of the strike.Netflix will meet with its board to discuss the pay package following the failed vote; however, the board could still approve the plans despite the disapproval from shareholders.Shares of the streaming platform have been booming recently.

The regulator also wants at least 50 seconds of anti-tobacco disclaimers, including an audio-visual, at the start and middle of each program.Amazon and other companies found it impossible to edit the films in three months and decided to consult lawyers and protest.Filmmaker Dylan Mohan Gray flagged the new Indian rules as ""harassment,"" as it did not regulate murder, war, and highly violent crime scenes similarly.India is a hot market for streaming giants, and executives fear business impact and higher costs.Price Action: NFLX shares traded lower by 1.22% at $398.22 on the last check Friday.Photo by Ivan Marc via ShutterstockDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Sarandos will also be paid $20 million in stock, and has the potential to earn a bonus worth up to $17 million. Peters will receive $17.3 million in stock as well as up to $14.3 million in bonuses.Hastings, meanwhile, will reportedly be paid a $500,000 salary and $2.5 million in stock this year after giving up the top job.Shareholders withheld support for the 2023 executive compensation packages, however, backing calls from striking writers to vote down the proposals.It is not yet clear how much the vote failed by, with the final tally to be included in an upcoming SEC filing.A spokesperson for Netflix was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Fortune.The result came just days after WGA West president Meredith Stiehm wrote an open letter to Netflix shareholders to urge they vote against the looming “say on pay” vote. She argued that approving the executive pay deals would be inappropriate in light of the ongoing situation.“While investors have long taken issue with Netflix's executive pay, the compensation structure is more egregious against the backdrop of the strike,” she wrote. Story continues“Shareholders should send a message to Netflix that if the company could afford to spend $166 million on executive compensation last year, it can afford to pay the estimated $68 million per year that writers are asking for in contract improvements and put an end to the disruptive strike,” she added, while noting that the company’s content pipeline was blocked until negotiations with the WGA were settled.Stiehm also wrote a similar letter to shareholders of Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. Comcast is scheduled to hold its own shareholder meeting on June 7.Following Thursday's shareholder vote, the WGA said in a series of tweets that Netflix needed to ""spend less time thinking up ways to pay its executive team more money and instead address the writers' strike that is delaying major shows like Stranger Things.""""It’s time for Netflix to pay writers fairly for the valuable content they create,"" the organization said.Members of the Writers Guild of America, who write and produce some of the world’s biggest movies and television shows, have been on strike for five weeks over pay and streaming services’ use of smaller writing staffs. Even before the writers’ strike, Netflix was struggling to secure approval for huge compensation deals it wanted to offer its senior leaders.At last year’s shareholder meeting, only 27% of shareholders backed Netflix’s executive compensation plan. Top executives at the firm saw their compensation jump in 2022 from a year earlier.Comparatively, in 2021, more than half of shareholders approved the deals offered to top executive officers at Netflix.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This is because inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand. This was prominent in Costco Wholesale Corporation’s COST sales results for May.May Sales DisappointCostco’s net sales increased 1.2% to $18.45 billion for the retail month of May from $18.23 billion last year. However, the rate of growth decelerated from the improvement of 3% witnessed in April.Comparable sales for the retail month of May — the four-week period ended May 28, 2023 — declined 0.3%. This followed an increase of 1.4% registered in April. Comparable sales for May reflected a decline of 1.5% in the United States but an increase of 0.5% and 5.5% in Canada and Other International locations, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExcluding the impacts of changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange, comparable sales for the month under discussion rose 3.3% on improvements of 1.7%, 7.9% and 6.4% in the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively.We note that Costco’s comparable e-commerce sales fell 7.6% year over year. Excluding the impact of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the same declined 7% year over year.ConclusionOne of the widely recognized names in the industry, Costco has been providing its members with quality goods and services. The company, which is among the biggest winners amid the pandemic, sells products at discounted prices to draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience. However, being a consumer-centric company, the warehouse retailer is not fully immune to headwinds impacting consumers’ spending activity.We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 12.3% so far in the year against the Retail – Discount Stores industry’s decline of 1.1%.Story continues3 Picks You Can’t Miss Out OnHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and General Mills GIS.Kroger, which operates as a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Public Service Enterprise Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.079 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$49b - US$5.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Public Service Enterprise Group has an ROCE of 7.9%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 5.0% generated by the Integrated Utilities industry, it's much better. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Public Service Enterprise Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Public Service Enterprise Group.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsPublic Service Enterprise Group has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 22% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesOur Take On Public Service Enterprise Group's ROCETo bring it all together, Public Service Enterprise Group has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Considering the stock has delivered 38% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you'd like to know more about Public Service Enterprise Group, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is significant.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

After declining 11.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why WYNN Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of WYNN shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.12. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for WYNN has increased 61.8%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, WYNN currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

It affects how we think, feel, and act. Additionally, all areas of our lives are impacted by mental health including our relationships, work, and physical health. Despite its importance, mental health is often misunderstood and viewed as taboo, leading many individuals to suffer in silence or avoid getting help. By highlighting available resources, we hope to raise awareness and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health.First aid that's more than a band-aidOne of the main goals of the Mental Health First Aid at Work program from the National Council for Mental Wellbeing is to remove barriers for those seeking help. This is accomplished by increasing awareness and understanding of mental illnesses. Mental Health First Aiders (MHFAs) learn to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental health and substance use challenges. The goal of the program is to equip aiders with an action plan and other essential tools so that more people can get the support they need.The courses include details on risk factors, warning signs, information on a variety of mental illnesses, a five-step action plan, and where to turn for help. Each course is formatted with hands-on activities and real-life applications. While MHFAs are ready to support individuals that may be experiencing mental health or substance abuse challenges, they do not diagnose conditions or provide medical treatments.Mental Health First Aiders at NRGSafety and well-being are a part of our Power Values; this not only includes physical well-being but also psychological well-being. The MHFA program is essential to putting that into action. It nurtures a positive environment and creates a safe space to talk. MHFAs can encourage colleagues with their training and connect them with appropriate employee or community resources. The program is also beneficial for early intervention or recognizing warning signs in someone who might be struggling.Story continuesCurrently, over 100 NRG teammates are certified MHFAs and ready to help any colleague that needs it. We interviewed three of NRG's MHFAs to learn more about why they chose to get certified and how the program has positively affected them.Kimberly Carpenter, Senior Director of NRG Business Marketing and Customer Experience, joined the program during the COVID-19 pandemic after seeing people experiencing a lot of mental stress. ""For me, it was the perfect opportunity to learn and be available to my team and others within the company. I wanted to be a resource because I knew that people were struggling during that time,"" she says.Since joining the MHFA program, Carpenter has been able to use her training at work. When a situation arises, she observes the warning signs a coworker presents and takes action. To her, ""knowing the signs to look for and being in tune with your team members to notice nuances and differences"" are important skills for everyone to have when identifying that someone needs help.For Lucas Spangler, Senior Manager of Commercialization, the MHFA program gave him the skills and language to have important conversations about mental health. He thinks MHFAs and EMTs share similarities saying, ""EMTs show up at a site, stabilize the person, and get them to a hospital. The Mental Health First Aider is doing the same thing for mental health. They understand and acknowledge that something is going on, then recommend the person to professional resources.""Approaching the conversation from a non-judgmental way and sharing similar personal experiences are a few ways Spangler connects with a coworker that's facing mental health challenges. He asks questions like ""Is it alright if I follow up with you in a few days?"" or ""Would you like me to do a bit of research for you?"" to gauge the best way to support someone and find them the right care.Rachel Gessel, a proposal writer for NRG Business, became an MHFA to learn how to react when people share that they've been through something difficult. She also joined to practice better care for herself saying, ""in order to show up as our best physically, mentally, and emotionally at home and work, we have to take care of ourselves.""The MHFA program really changed Gessel's perspective on mental health. ""I learned that mental health challenges are just like physical challenges because healing is possible. Prior to receiving the training, I just thought once you were mentally unwell it never went away, but now I know that is incorrect,"" she says.All three MHFAs discussed the importance of finding ways to take breaks and improve your mental well-being daily. They recommend activities such as reading, exercising, gardening, unplugging, meditating, but most importantly doing what works best for you.Supporting your total well-beingMuch like with physical health, mental health gets better with activities. Set aside time for mindfulness every day and prioritize self-care. Checking on those around you and getting involved with mental health initiatives are other great practices.We are here to support our employees, customers, and communities with mental health resources. Remember, you are not alone. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, seeking help is the first step and can lend you skills that lead to long-term well-being. ""Our best resources are those who see us every day. Find that person you trust enough to be able to say, ‘I'm struggling, can you help me?',"" recommends Spangler.For more information on how you can become an MHFA, visit the official website.If you are experiencing a suicidal crisis or emotional distress, please call or text the 24-hour Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/nrg-energyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758885/Why-Mental-Health-First-Aiders-Are-Essential-in-the-Workplace]"

The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.05%, as of May 29. It is among the best dividend aristocrat stocks on our list.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the leading stakeholder of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) with 400 million shares at the end of Q1 2023. Overall, 61 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company, with a collective value of over $24.8 billion.Here is what Rown Street had to say about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter.“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Patterson Companies (PDCO). PDCO is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 11.14, which compares to its industry's average of 17.62. Over the past 52 weeks, PDCO's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.07 and as low as 10.21, with a median of 11.83.Investors should also recognize that PDCO has a P/B ratio of 2.32. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 6.50. Over the past 12 months, PDCO's P/B has been as high as 2.98 and as low as 2.25, with a median of 2.59.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PDCO has a P/S ratio of 0.4. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.92.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that PDCO has a P/CF ratio of 9.19. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PDCO's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 21.12. PDCO's P/CF has been as high as 11.14 and as low as 8.53, with a median of 9.68, all within the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Patterson Companies's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PDCO looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have added about 6.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Verisk Surpasses Q1 EstimatesVerisk Analytics Inc. reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2023 results.Adjusted earnings (excluding 92 cents from non-recurring items) were $1.29 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% and our estimates by 10.3%. This was due to strong segmental revenue growth and core operating leverage. Adjusted earnings decreased 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.Total revenues of $651.6 million surpassed the consensus estimate by 3.1% and our estimate by 3.4% but decreased 16% from the year-ago figure. The reduced top line can be correlated to the sale of the company’s environmental health and safety business (""3E"") and the Financial Services segment.Segment DetailsThe Insurance segment’s revenues grew 11.1% on a reported basis and 9.8% on an OCC basis in the first quarter.Underwriting and rating revenues saw an uptick of 10.7% to $460.5 million. Claim revenues increased to $191.1 million, indicating an increase of 12.1% on a year-over-year basis.With the Energy and Specialized Markets segment qualified as discontinued operations, no revenues were reported from the segment. Verisk Financial Services was sold in April 2022 and no revenues for the segment are accounted for.Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1% on a year-over-year basis to $340.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was at 52.2%, increasing 210 basis points from the year-ago figure.Net cash generated from operating activities was $365.3 million. The free cash flow generated during the quarter was $304.1 million.Story continues2023 GuidanceThe company expects revenues to be in the range of $2.59-$2.63 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the band of $1.37-$1.42 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the band of 53-54%. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated to be between $5.2 and $5.5.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Verisk has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVerisk is part of the Zacks Business - Information Services industry. Over the past month, S&amp;P Global (SPGI), a stock from the same industry, has gained 6.2%.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Qualcomm Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates on Lower RevenuesQualcomm reported weak second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and soft recovery in China, resulting in lower-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line missed the same despite the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. Shares declined sharply post earnings release owing to a soft outlook due to limited market visibility and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter declined to $1,704 million or $1.52 per share from $2,934 million or $2.57 per share in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $2,420 million or $2.15 per share compared with $3,661 million or $3.21 per share in the year-ago quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues owing to soft demand trends. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.RevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal second quarter were $9,275 million compared with $11,164 million in the prior-year quarter. Despite solid automotive revenues, the top line decreased on soft demand patterns and elevated inventory levels owing to market uncertainty and macroeconomic woes. High inflationary pressures and soft economic recovery in China further compounded the problems. However, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector.Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $9,268 million compared with $11,158 million in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly revenues beat the consensus mark of $9,080 million.Story continuesSegment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) declined 17% year over year to $7,942 million, as strength in the automotive platform was more than offset by lower demand in handsets and channel inventory drawdown within the IoT business. Despite solid potential in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets, the company witnessed lower demand owing to an uncertain landscape.Automotive revenues rose 20% to $447 million, while handset and IoT revenues were down 17% and 24%, respectively, to $6,105 million and $1,390 million. EBT margin for the QCT segment decreased to 27% from 35%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,290 million, down 18% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. EBT margin declined to 68% from 73%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $1,457 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal second quarter compared with $2,698 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for the first half of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $4,552 million and $4,755 million. At quarter-end, the company had $3,488 million in cash and cash equivalents and $15,486 million of long-term debt. The company repurchased 7 million shares for $903 million during the quarter.Q3 GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $8.1-$8.9 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory. Management expects the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, high inflation and a slower recovery in China to adversely impact demand as customers remain cautious with their purchasing decisions, further leading to inflated inventory levels. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $1.70-$1.90 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.24-$1.44 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.35 billion. For QCT, the company anticipates revenues between $6.9 billion and $7.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.21% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qualcomm has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerQualcomm belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry. Another stock from the same industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR), has gained 7.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Juniper reported revenues of $1.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.4%. EPS of $0.48 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.Juniper is expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9%.Juniper has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

Consider PulteGroup (PHM),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-fast-paced-momentum-stock-125004977.html,1685710204,STORY,['PHM'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 1.4% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this homebuilder well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PHM meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 23.6% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PHM is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.34. This indicates that the stock moves 34% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PHM has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PHM earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PHM is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PHM is currently trading at 0.90 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 90 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PHM appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PHM, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen.

With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Johnson &amp; Johnson, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Johnson &amp; Johnson?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Johnson &amp; Johnson. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.2% and 5.0% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Johnson &amp; JohnsonWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Johnson &amp; Johnson in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$356m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 35% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Johnson &amp; Johnson   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks are garnering investors’ attention in 2023 as the stock market recovers from its bear market lows seen last year. There are several studies showing the effectiveness of dividend investing. For example, Heartland Advisors conducted one such research which showed that from 1802 to 2002, dividends represented 5.8% of the full 7.9% total annualized return of the stock market, including dividend growth. The study also cited London Business School’s research, which showed that the average real return across 17 countries from 1900 to 2005 stood at 5%, while the average dividend yield of those countries came in at 4.5% during this period.Dividend investing may seem a simple strategy on the surface, but there are many dimensions to consider in order to generate regular income through these stocks. Reinvesting dividends is one of the most popular ways to accelerate income through the power of compounding. Since 1960, reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the S&amp;P 500’s total returns, as we reported in our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know. We further mentioned data in the article which showed that the broad market’s annual average return over the past 50 years came in at 7.58%, which grew to 10.51% by reinvesting dividends. Additionally, dividends can contribute to investors’ overall performance and reduce volatility because of their defensive nature. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC last year about the importance of dividend stocks. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Essentially, dividends can improve your performance by a third without doing anything. You can add octane to your performance just by owning dividend-paying stocks.”Story continuesThis is to be noted that last year was one of the best years for dividend stocks as they outperformed the market by a wide margin. Moreover, companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid a record amount to shareholders in dividends.While dividend payment frequencies can vary among different companies, some of them choose to distribute dividends on an annual basis. The decision to pay annual dividends may be influenced by the respective company’s financial stability, profitability, and cash flow. In addition to this, businesses in certain industries or stages of growth may opt for annual dividends to provide a substantial return to shareholders while retaining more capital for reinvestment. While major companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) pay dividends on a quarterly basis, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks that offer annual dividends.14 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend companies that pay dividends just once a year to shareholders.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive.

At the final analysis of the study, KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR=0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.98]; two-sided p value=0.0324), with a median OS of 17.3 months (95% CI, 14.4-21.3) versus 16.1 months (95% CI, 13.1-18.2) for chemotherapy alone. These late-breaking data are being presented today during an oral abstract session at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (abstract #LBA8505) and are being discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230603005005/en/""Patients with pleural mesothelioma are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, when the five year survival rate is only 12% and curative surgery is not an option,"" said Dr. Lesley Seymour, Director of the Investigational New Drug program at CCTG, and Senior Investigator for IND.227. ""The addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-pemetrexed in our study resulted in significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rates compared to platinum-pemetrexed alone, regardless of PD-L1 expression. This regimen represents a potential new treatment option for patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma.""""These results support the potential of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as a new first-line option for patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma, who currently have limited treatment options,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""These data demonstrate our commitment to improving outcomes for patients with different types of thoracic cancer through our expansive clinical development program and research evaluating KEYTRUDA in new, difficult-to-treat tumors.""Story continuesStudy design and additional data from IND.227/KEYNOTE-483IND.227/KEYNOTE-483 is a randomized, open-label Phase 2/3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02784171) sponsored and conducted by CCTG in collaboration with National Cancer Institute of Naples (NCIN) and Intergroupe Francophone de Cancérologie Thoracique (IFCT). Merck provided KEYTRUDA and support for the trial. The trial evaluated KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with unresected advanced pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint of the study is OS, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) modified for mesothelioma, safety and quality of life. The Phase 3 part of the trial enrolled 440 patients who were randomized to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] for up to 35 cycles) plus pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 Q3W for six cycles) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Q3W for six cycles; carboplatin substitution [AUC 5-6 Q3W for six cycles] was permitted), orPemetrexed and cisplatin (carboplatin substitution was permitted) alone.PFS was also significantly improved for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (HR=0.80 [95%CI, 0.65-0.99], two-sided p value = 0.0372; median PFS 7.13 months versus 7.16 months respectively). At 12 months, the estimated PFS rate was 26% for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy versus 17% for chemotherapy alone. The ORR was significantly higher for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (62% versus 38%, p&lt;0.0001).The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy in this study was consistent with previously reported studies. Adverse events related to study treatment of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 27% of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy arm, and 15% of patients on the chemotherapy-alone arm. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events in the KEYTRUDA arm were fatigue (7%), nausea (5%) and febrile neutropenia (5%); the corresponding values for the chemotherapy arm were 6%, 1% and 1%. KEYTRUDA-related adverse events resulting in discontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy.About mesotheliomaMesothelioma is a type of cancer that starts in the linings of certain parts of the body, including the chest, abdomen, heart and testicles. Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 30,000 new cases of mesothelioma diagnosed and more than 26,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Pleural mesothelioma, which develops in the lining of the lungs, is the most common form of mesothelioma, accounting for about 75% of all cases. Pleural mesothelioma often progresses rapidly, and the five-year survival rate is only 12%. Although incidence of mesothelioma has gradually declined in the U.S., continued use of and exposure to asbestos around the world has resulted in increasing global rates of this aggressive disease.About the Canadian Cancer Trials GroupThe Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) is a cancer clinical trials research cooperative that develops, conducts and analyses phase I-III trials to test anti-cancer and supportive therapies at over 85 hospitals and cancer centres across Canada and internationally. From their operations centre at Queen's University, CCTG has supported more than 600 trials enrolling 100,000 patients from 40 countries on 6 continents through a global network of 20,000 investigators and clinical trial staff. CCTG is a national program of the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) and their aim is to improve survival and quality of life for all people with cancer. CCTG IND.227 was supported by a grant from CCS (707213). For further information, please visit the CCTG website: www.cctg.ca.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

To explore similar stocks, you can take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market.""The Winners Make No Sense""On May 9, CNBC's Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, dived into the current market dynamics to try and unravel the perplexing trends and developments we've been seeing unfold in the market so far in 2023. While bears have been whispering that a ""financial storm"" has been brewing and has ""snuck up on us,"" with a debt ceiling crisis and economic recession on the horizon, Cramer notes that the market still has not ""cratered."" Everyone seems to be confused about how the market has been ""hanging in there."" To deal with this confusion, Cramer went through several financial chart to try and spot what the ""strategists might be missing."" The answer he came to was that the stocks and sectors that have been rising seem to ""make no sense."" In fact, ""they aren't supposed to be on top all at once"" at all.Noting this perplexing phenomenon, Cramer then begins to go over various sectors and companies that had been performing well in May. While they included big-tech names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) alongside major drug companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), they also included industrials, housing, travel and leisure, and consumer packaged goods companies. With such a wide range of positively-performing sectors, especially those that are generally not up all together at the same time, Cramer began to break down what has been setting each sector apart in 2023, leading to its success.Cramer's Thoughts on Industrials and Housing StocksIn answering the question behind the success of industrials stocks even after the Fed has raised ""rates by 500 basis points in 14 months,"" Cramer noted that most leaders in this industry ""are involved in aerospace, or decarbonization, or both. He explained that the aerospace industry, being cyclical in nature and hosting ""so much pent up demand,"" is one of the key factors driving the growth being several industrials stocks. These include companies that are suppliers for ""Boeing or Air Bus, like General Electric.""Story continuesMoving on from industrials, Cramer delves deep into the housing industry and notes that historically, housing stocks ""should be at their 52-week-lows, not highs"" because ""when the Fed raises rates aggressively, these stocks are supposed to get hammered."" However, considering the ""tremendous housing shortage"" in the US, this industry has actually been incredibly successful so far in 2023. Homebuilders have also apparently ""raised prices by a gigantic amount, roughly 25% on average over the past two years."" According to Cramer, this trend has become pronounced in the housing industry because the rising demand for housing in the US has reduced the need for housing companies to offer lower prices to their customers.""Healthcare Is Running""Another industry whose success Cramer sees as an anomaly is the healthcare industry. Cramer noted that stocks operating in this sector are usually ""classic slow-down stocks that shouldn't be running at the same time as the industrials and the housing stocks,"" but this doesn't seem to be the case this year. The reason behind this development seems to be the ""new product cycles"" many drug companies are enjoying in 2023. There's also the ""emerging turn in medical devices"" as the pandemic has died down. According to Cramer, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals ""deferred non-urgent surgeries,"" so now, with the pandemic out of the way, demand for these surgeries and the devices required for them has ""come back with a vengeance.""""Pent-up demand"" is also the key factor behind the surprising success of travel and leisure stocks, according to Cramer. He noted that ""we're in a weird post-pandemic moment where everybody feels long on money and short on time."" This sense of urgency that many people in the US may feel best explains the perplexing case of the travel and leisure industry, which ""should be faltering at this stage"" but isn't.In short, Cramer helped explain the confusing market reality on his show by holding up a microscope to the performance of the companies in these industries. Considering these factors, we decided to cover the top stocks out of the ones Cramer mentioned on Mad Money.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we watched Jim Cramer's Mad Money episode from May 9, when the host gave a rundown on what stocks and sectors have been climbing the market so far in 2023. Cramer went through a range of names, including industrial companies, housing corporations, drug companies, consumer packaged goods stocks, and big tech. Of these names, we selected those that have been the most popular among hedge funds in 2023, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. We shortlisted the top ten based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, and ranked them using this metric, from the lowest to the highest number.Stocks Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks mentioned by Cramer in his ""big-cap tech"" stocks list. These were the stocks he believes have been confusing the market with their performance so far this year because they've been rising.As of June 2, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up 42.72% year-to-date.Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer raised his price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares from $800 to $900 on June 2. The analyst also has an Outperform rating on the stock.Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was spotted in the portfolios of 72 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value was $3.5 billion.The most prominent shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of the first quarter was Citadel Investment Group, holding 1.1 million shares in the company.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the quarter following the company’s solid fourth quarter 2022 results. This was driven by better-than-expected results in both its semiconductor solutions, networking and storage segments. The company also provided first quarter guidance that was ahead of consensus as well as 2023 commentary that expects earnings momentum to continue due to a strong product cycle.”9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72There were 72 hedge funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.According to Cramer, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a drug company that is offering ""diabetes drugs that could be revolutionary weight loss treatments."" Because of such products, the stock ""would be going up under a strong or weak economy.""Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is up 19.59% year-to-date as of June 2.On May 26, Wells Fargo analysts raised their price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) from $440 to $500 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Fred Alger Management made the following comment about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.”Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a stock that has performed well in the current market conditions.8. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73As of June 2, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is up by 11.06% year-to-date.An Outperform rating was held on Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shares on May 25 by Ambrish Srivastava at BMO Capital. The analyst also placed a $200 price target on the stock.Analog Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADI) in the first quarter. Their total stake value came up to $4.9 billion.Generation Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 5.1 million shares.Here's what  First Pacific Advisors said about Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock price declined in the first half of 2022, along with its semiconductor peers. That sector has since rebounded, lifting ADI with it. We believe ADI is a well-run company and a secular grower, which should augur well for its future. However, given that it operates in a cyclical industry, we will not be surprised when its shares periodically trade down.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Carter Gould, an analyst at Barclays, holds an Overweight rating on Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares as of May 1.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a consumer packaged goods stock that has been surging because, like many others, its costs decreased ""while the prices stayed the same,"" according to Cramer.On April 26, Lauren Lieberman reiterated an Overweight rating on The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shares while raising her price target on the stock from $160 to $167.Bridgewater Associates was the most prominent shareholder in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) at the end of the first quarter, holding 4.9 million shares.

(NYSE:WMB) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 87% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-companies-inc-nyse-wmb-160809228.html,1685722089,STORY,['WMB'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Williams Companies' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Williams Companies, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Williams Companies?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Williams Companies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Williams Companies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Williams Companies. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.9% and 7.0% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Williams CompaniesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that The Williams Companies, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$135m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Williams Companies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(The) (WMB). Shares have added about 0% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Williams Companies, Inc. (The) due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Williams Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Outpace EstimatesThe Williams Companies reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The bottom line also outdid the year-ago period’s reported figure of 41 cents. The outperformance was due to higher-than-expected contributions from one major segment — Northeast G&amp;P. Adjusted EBITDA from the segment totaled $470 million, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $453 million. The figure also increased 12.4% on a year-over-year basis.Williams’ revenues of $3.1 billion in the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion. The top line also outperformed the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.5 billion, which could be attributed to increased revenues from service.Key TakeawaysAdjusted EBITDA was $1.79 billion in the quarter under review, an increase of 18.5% from the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.51 billion, up 39.8% from that recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022.Segmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $728 million, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. This was largely driven by much higher service revenues from Transco’s recent in-service Leidy South expansion project.West: This segment registered an adjusted EBITDA of $286 million, 10% higher than $260 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. The improvement resulted from contributions from Trace Midstream and the benefits of realized gains on natural gas hedges.Northeast G&amp;P: Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was $470 million, up 12.4% from the prior-year quarter’s $418 million. This uptick can be attributed to higher volumes at Ohio Valley Midstream, Marcellus South and Cardinal.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated an adjusted EBITDA of 231 million compared with $65 million in the year-ago quarter. The upside reflects higher commodity marketing margins and a $390-million net favorable change in unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetTotal costs and expenses amounted to $1.72 billion in the reported quarter.Total capital expenditure was $525 million compared with $316 million a year ago. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $477 million, and a long-term debt of $22.79 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 61.4%.2023 GuidanceWMB expects its full-year adjusted EBITDA to be $6.4-$6.8 billion. Growth capital spending is anticipated to be $1.6-$1.9 billion. Williams expects to achieve a leverage ratio mid-point of 3.65. This, along with the scope of generating a positive free cash flow after dividends and capital expenditure (excluding the Trace acquisition of approximately $950 million), offers financial flexibility. The dividend guidance for 2023 increased 5.3% on an annualized basis to $1.79 from $1.70 in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Williams Companies, Inc.

126,c4f0ca66-a9c3-397d-b8ce-a955c74d2223,BA,2023-06-03,Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is threatened by new design flaws,Quartz,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeings-starliner-spacecraft-threatened-design-175600917.html,1685728560,STORY,['BA'],"[Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on the launch pad in 2021.If you want to imagine an engineer’s nightmare, here it goes: You’ve spent nearly a decade building a spacecraft, testing and re-testing the vehicle to ensure it can survive the extreme conditions onboard a rocket to orbit. Now, you’re preparing to launch NASA astronauts into space in a month.Then, someone comes up to you. Do you remember the tape—the tape we wrapped around all the wires hidden behind panels in the spacecraft, to protect them from shorting out? Hundreds of feet of tape? Turns out that tape is flammable. We’re going to have to disassemble the whole spacecraft to see where it is and how to fix it, or else risk a potentially disastrous fire.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesOh, and by the way, we also found out that a key link in the parachutes that bring the capsule down for a safe landing are made of a material that’s too weak for our safety standards. We’ll have to re-do that, too.All this happened over the past week to Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft program, sending Mark Nappi, the executive in charge, to CEO Dave Calhoun to get permission to stand down from an already long-delayed crew flight test.Boeing was tapped to build this vehicle by NASA in 2014, alongside rival SpaceX. Elon Musk’s company delivered its Dragon crew vehicle in 2020, and since then it has flown eight times to orbit, carrying government astronauts and private passengers.Boeing’s troubled Starliner development hit another snagIn contrast, Boeing’s program has lurched from problem to problem. Delays and the need to re-do a failed flight test have cost the company $585 million, since its original $4.2 billion fixed-price contract with NASA doesn’t allow for overages. Engineers may still need to redesign the Starliner’s  propulsion system: The valves that regulate the flow of fuel through the system have malfunctioned in the past, and while Boeing says changes in the way it loads fuel can prevent the problem, changing the system might make more sense.Story continuesLast week, NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), said the space agency should stand up an independent review of Starliner to ensure that it will be safe enough to carry people. Steve Stich, the NASA official responsible for Starliner development, said that NASA engineers embedded with Boeing’s Starliner team will convene with the NASA’s chief engineer to offer an independent assessment of the program.Boeing was criticized for failing to perform comprehensive testing before the failure of its first flight test. The discovery of two new safety issues just weeks before a crewed test flight isn’t a great development. On one hand, the process in place caught these risks, and Boeing communicated about them transparently. On the other hand, these problems are years old.“I have seen a tremendous change in Boeing culture since the first orbital flight test,” Stich told reporters yesterday. “I wouldn’t go indict the NASA or Boeing safety process because we have these late findings.”Nappi argued that Boeing’s safety culture had always been strong, but conceded “there was a certain sense of optimism when some of the designs were done, some of the processes were created many years ago, that led to some of these things creeping their way through the system.”What’s next for Starliner?Nappi said his team would need to further assess the problems with the wiring tape and the parachute links before it could determine when a new test flight is possible. While the space agency and its contractor didn’t rule out a test flight later this year, the potential work needed to fix the problems—which might include additional parachute drop tests—mean that test flight might not come until 2024.That’s an issue for NASA, which “desperately needs a second provider of crew transportation,” according to Stich. SpaceX’s current monopoly on human spaceflight in the western world means it can drive up prices: While the company’s first flights for NASA were estimated at $55 million per seat, additional contracts to fly astronauts have come in at $70 million per astronaut. Boeing’s seats will cost more for the duration of the ISS’s expected lifespan, but lowering the cost of getting people to orbit in the future will require multiple providers.Boeing, which had a critical roles in the Space Shuttle and is the prime contractor for the International Space Station, has seen its space businesses face significant headwinds. Its speciality on the satellite side—building large, bespoke satellites—is seen as a business in decline, and its joint venture with Lockheed Martin to build rockets, United Launch Alliance, is reportedly up for sale.Analysts say that Boeing may not be able to recoup its losses on the Starliner program under the NASA contract, and may also face challenges winning private human spaceflight business. Nappi insisted that there was no thought at Boeing about abandoning Starliner, and said discussions were ongoing about how to use the spacecraft more in the future by adapting its design to fly on rockets besides the soon-to-be-retired Atlas V.“We know there are growing pains in developing a vehicle,” said Nappi. “This is just part of the business.”More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

ILMN recently unveiled new PrimateAI-3D — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm which identifies disease-causing genetic mutations in patients. PrimateAI-3D will be made broadly available to the genomics community integrated across Illumina Connected Software.The National Institutes of Health estimate that the annual production of genomic data is reaching 40 billion gigabytes. To make discoveries that will expand knowledge of human health and promote precision medicine, it is essential to be able to share, analyse and interpret genetic data.The latest development will fortify Illumina’s goals to strengthen its foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing market globally.More on PrimateAI-3DMillions of genetic variations exist in each individual, which contribute to individual variances in health and illness risk. However, the majority of these variations are unknown in function. PrimateAI-3D solves a crucial issue that prevents the successful use of personalized genomic medicine by highlighting disease-causing variations with unmatched accuracy.PrimateAI-3D uses deep neural network designs like ChatGPT and AlphaFold to attain its cutting-edge performance. It is trained on genomic sequences rather than human language.The outcome is a deep neural network that can identify disease-causing variants with higher accuracy in all six clinical cohorts examined and generate personalized predictions of genetic disease risk that have been verified in a cohort of nearly half a million individuals.PrimateAI-3D – Unlocking New PotentialPrimateAI-3D's integration of cutting-edge AI technology with the most sophisticated DNA sequencing capabilities is fascinating. The vital work being done to improve patient care might be tremendously accelerated if physicians and researchers were assisted in handling the enormous genetic data that is being generated from the company’s platforms.A vital step towards the equitable application of genetic-based precision medicine for diverse, non-European populations, PrimateAI-3D also significantly increased the accuracy of genetic risk prediction, enabling the first demonstration of polygenic risk scores that were largely unaffected by ancestry bias.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBy unravelling the causes of complex genetic disorders like diabetes, heart disease and autoimmune diseases, the application of the most recent advancements in AI to genomics provides noteworthy prospects for Illumina in genetic risk prediction and medication target identification.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global genomics market size was valued at $28.1 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 16.5% up to 2030.Given the market potential, Illumina latest development is well-timed.Recent DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Illumina collaborated with African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) to develop a training academy.

Shares have lost about 9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Horizon Therapeutics due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Horizon Q1 Earnings and Revenues Miss EstimatesHorizon Therapeutics reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly revenues of $832 million declined 6% year over year, owing mostly to the seasonal impact on Tepezza sales, which the company typically sees with its infused medicines in the first quarter of each year. Revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $896 million.Quarter in DetailHorizon reported financial results in the single segment, owing to the wind-down of the inflammation business, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022.In the unified segment, Tepezza sales construed 48.7% of the net sales amounting to $405.3 million (down 19%), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $493 million. Per management, the field-force expansion initiated late in 2022 has not yet substantially benefitted net sales.Krystexxa sales rose 33% year over year to $187 million.Ravicti sales were $90.3 million in the quarter, up 15% year over year.Procysbi sales were $50.5 million in the quarter, up 2% year over year.Uplizna sales were $53.8 million in the quarter, up 77% year over year.Actimmune sales were $29.1 million in the quarter, down 7% year over year.Research and development expenses were $134.1 million, up 30% from the year-ago quarter.

(OLED). Shares have added about 9.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Universal Display due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Display Beats Q1 Earnings Estimates, Revenues FalterUniversal Display reported mixed first-quarter 2023 results, with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line beating the same by a penny. Despite ongoing innovation initiatives, the company reported lower revenues year over year primarily driven by a decline in material sales stemming from weakness in the global economy.Net IncomeNet income during the reported quarter was $39.8 million or 83 cents per share compared with $50 million or $1.05 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The year over year decline was primarily induced by lower net sales in the quarter.RevenuesTotal revenues declined to $130.5 million from $150.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Uncertainty in the global economy and decline in material sales led to year over year revenue contraction. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $136 million.Material sales revenue stood at $70.2 million, down from $86.7 million a year ago. Green emitter sales were $54 million down from $66 million, while red emitter sales declined to $16 million from $20 million.  The royalty and license fees generated revenues of $55.2 million compared with $59.8 million in the prior-year quarter due to lower unit material volume. The contract research services generated revenues of $5.1 million, up from $4 million in the prior-year quarter.Other DetailsGross profit in the first quarter was $97.5 million compared with $117.3 million in the prior-year period with respective margins of 75% and 78%. Underutilization in the Shannon facility and an increase in inventory provision led to the decline. Operating income was $45.4 million compared with $62.3 million in the prior-year quarter, with an operating margin of 35% and 41%, respectively.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn the quarter, Universal Display generated $47.6 million from operating activities compared with $52.6 million in the prior-year period. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $158.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $60.2 in retirement plan benefit liability.OutlookFor 2023, management expects revenues to be in the range of $550-$600 million. Despite macroeconomic challenges, management expects increase in OLED adoption and healthy growth in the coming years driven by the company’s ongoing investment in innovation and infrastructure development.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.85% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Universal Display has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Universal Display has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerUniversal Display is part of the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Components industry. Over the past month, TE Connectivity (TEL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.7%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.TE Connectivity reported revenues of $4.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.8%.

141,d019c1be-cb5b-39cd-b7a9-37fd8d72bf84,NKE,2023-06-03,Michael Jordan's 'Air Jordan' championship sneakers could each rake in $1 million in Sotheby's private sale,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/michael-jordans-air-jordan-championship-110016818.html,1685790016,VIDEO,['NKE'],"[Michael Jordan's championship game-worn shoes are now on public display ahead of a private sale as Sotheby's expands its white-glove treatment to a younger, growing streetwear and modern collectibles segment.The ""Dynasty Collection"" includes six individual sneakers, originally designed and released by Nike (NKE), that Michael Jordan wore during each of his NBA Finals championship-clinching games for the Chicago Bulls during the 1990s. The exhibition runs through June 7 — coinciding with the 2023 NBA Finals best of 7 series.The coveted memorabilia doesn't have a price tag or seller detail publicly available yet, but estimates suggest just one of the shoes could fetch offers north of $1 million, based on sales of comparable sports collectibles.Video Transcript- Sotheby's is known for generating eye-popping sales across a range of ultra rare art, luxury goods, and property. The streetwear and modern collectibles arm of the business is now the platform for the sale of what it's dubbed ""The Dynasty Collection"" which consists of one Air Jordan shoe from each of Michael Jordan's six championship-clinching NBA Finals games.Yahoo Finance had the opportunity to go hands on-- with white gloves, of course-- to discuss the shoes once worn by ""His Airness.""What's going on, everyone. Yahoo Finance here with Brahm Wachter who is Sotheby's head of streetwear and modern collectibles. Talk to us about your segment within Sotheby's. What type of growth have you seen?BRAHM WACHTER: Well, Sotheby's luxury as an overall did over $2.3 billion in sale last year. Streetwear and modern collectibles did about 50 million. An in our offerings, about 90% of the lots were sold.- Who are the buyers that you hear from and the interest that you hear from as well?BRAHM WACHTER: Our buyers typically are younger, so they typically range 20 to 40. They're sort of titans of industry, so usually successful in finance, successful in real estate, advertising, marketing. They have either a passion for sports memorabilia, collectibles, or they just have a passion for-- for deadstock sneakers.Story continues- So I did walk in off the street. I saw this exhibition. I said, Brahm, I want to purchase like here and now today. How much do I need to be ready to potentially pony up?BRAHM WACHTER: Obviously we've got six unbelievable sneakers here. And so, you know, the sky's the limit.We've noticed that in terms of sports collectibles over the last year, even given the economic turmoil at a high level, the market is doing really well. We sold, less than a year ago, Michael Jordan's jersey from Game 1 of the 1998 NBA Finals for $10.1 million.Shortly thereafter, we sold the LeBron jersey from Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals for $3.7 million. And then we later sold a Kobe jersey for just about $6 million. And so what we're seeing is for the highest end collectibles, for the best sports memorabilia, and really the most iconic moments of different athletes' careers, the market really has been quite strong. And we haven't seen really a sign of that slowing down.]"

149,23e9c7da-f442-317f-8a39-6f69ff8a9f26,WFC,2023-06-03,"FDIC-Insured Banks' Q1 Earnings Up on Higher NII, Two Banks Fail",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fdic-insured-banks-q1-earnings-121500953.html,1685708100,STORY,"['BAC', 'C', 'WFC', 'JPM']","[The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported first-quarter 2023 earnings of $79.8 billion, jumping 33.6% year over year. The increase was primarily attributable to a solid improvement in net interest income, which more than offset the rise in provisions and non-interest expenses.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the March-ended quarter. Though such banks constitute only 3% of the total number of FDIC-insured institutes, these account for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Some of the notable names in this space are JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC.At present, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A rise in net operating revenues driven by solid growth in net interest income and an increase in non-interest income acted as a major tailwind. Also, higher interest rates and decent loan demand offered support.Nonetheless, banks’ earnings were adversely impacted by higher provisions on expectations of a deteriorating operating backdrop. Further, a rise in non-interest expenses and lower deposit balance were headwinds.Community banks, constituting 91% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported a net income of $7 billion, up 6.1% year over year.The return on average assets in first-quarter 2023 rose to 1.36% from 1.16% as of Mar 31, 2022.Net Operating Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseNet operating revenues came in at $261.7 billion, up 21.9% year over year.Net interest income (NII) was $175.7 billion, increasing 27.3% year over year.Net interest margin (NIM) jumped 77 basis points (bps) to 3.31%, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25%. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also witnessed an increase in NIM.Non-interest income grew 12.2% to $86 billion.Total non-interest expenses were $141.3 billion, increasing 5.6%. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation expenses.Despite the rise in expenses, the banking industry recorded a fall in efficiency ratio to 53% in the first quarter from 62% in the prior-year quarter. This was mainly attributable to “strong growth in net interest income.”Story continuesCredit Quality DeterioratingNet charge-offs (NCOs) for loans and leases were $12.4 billion, surging 97.5% year over year. NCO rate was 0.41% in the first quarter, up 19 bps from the prior-year quarter. Despite the increase, the NCO rate was below the pre-pandemic average of 0.48%.Provisions for credit losses were $20.7 billion during the first quarter, up substantially from $5.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Several lenders, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, reported higher provisions.Loans &amp; Deposits FallAs of Mar 31, 2023, total loans and leases were $12.21 trillion, which declined marginally from the prior quarter. This was majorly due to loans transferred to the FDIC as receiver and a seasonal fall in credit card loan balances.Total deposits amounted to $18.74 trillion, down 2.5% sequentially, mainly due to an 8.3% decrease in uninsured deposits. This marked the largest fall on a quarterly basis and the fourth consecutive quarterly decline.  As of Mar 31, 2023, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance decreased 9.5% from the December 2022 level to $116.1 billion. A decline in the DIF was largely due to loss provisions because of the failure of two banks and amounts set aside for the anticipated failure of First Republic Bank.Two Bank Failures, One New BankDuring the reported quarter, two banks – Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – failed, while one new bank was added. Further, 31 banks were absorbed following mergers.As of Mar 31, 2023, the number of ‘problem’ banks was 45, up from 41 in the prior quarter. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions increased to $58 billion from $47.5 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.ConclusionThe FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, said, “The banking industry continues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, slower economic growth, and geopolitical uncertainty. Credit quality and profitability may weaken due to these risks and may result in a further tightening of loan underwriting, slower loan growth, higher provision expenses, and liquidity constraints.”Though rising deposit costs will weigh on banks’ top-line growth, higher interest rates and decent loan demand will offer much-needed support going forward. Also, banks have been changing the revenue mix toward non-interest sources, which are likely to provide additional support to revenues. Nonetheless, a worsening macroeconomic environment is expected to weigh on banks’ financials in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share, indicating a change of +71.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.79 points to a change of +52.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.75 indicates a change of -0.7% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $20.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +18.7%. The $80.31 billion and $78.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.8% and -2.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.96%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.45%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 2.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 5.41%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the drugmaker had lost 0.55% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Medical sector's loss of 3.5% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.53% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Pfizer as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Pfizer to post earnings of $0.63 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 69.12%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.01 billion, down 49.51% from the prior-year quarter.PFE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.35 per share and revenue of $68.1 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -49.09% and -32.13%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.4% lower within the past month. Pfizer is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Pfizer has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.36 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 14.56, so we one might conclude that Pfizer is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, PFE's PEG ratio is currently 1.26. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.65 as of yesterday's close.The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103, putting it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The European Commission approved Novartis’ (NVS) IL-17A inhibitor, Cosentyx, for a new indication — hidradenitis suppurativa. J&amp;J JNJ submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking approval for a single-tablet combination therapy of Opsumit for the long-term treatment of PAH. Sanofi’s SNY phase II study on a novel pipeline candidate, frexalimab, for treating relapsing multiple sclerosis met the primary endpoint.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approves Pfizer’s RSV Vaccine for Older Adults: The FDA approved Pfizer’s RSV vaccine called Abrysvo (RSVpreF) for older adults. The vaccine is approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in individuals 60 years and older. The FDA approval for the RSV vaccine for older adults was based on data from the RENOIR study, which had enrolled approximately 37,000 participants. In February, the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted in favor of RSVpreF for older adults. The committee voted 7 to 4 on safety and 7 to 4 on effectiveness.Pfizer has also developed an RSV vaccine for infants through maternal immunization. The vaccine candidate is under FDA review, with a decision expected in August. Pfizer’s RSV vaccine candidate is also under review for both older adults and maternal immunization in Europe.Pfizer’s pivotal phase III study evaluating its novel anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, marstacimab for treating hemophilia A and B patients without inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX, met its primary endpoints. Data from the study demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with marstacimab led to a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR) compared to prophylaxis and on-demand intravenous regimens in the abovementioned patient group. Study participants, who received factor replacement therapy in the six-month lead-in period, achieved a 92% reduction in bleeds upon switching to marstacimab. Data from the BASIS study also showed the superiority of marstacimab over the prophylaxis regimen, achieving a 35% reduction in ABR.Story continuesAstraZeneca Discontinues Studies on Brazikumab: AstraZeneca announced that it is discontinuing the Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) studies on its an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, brazikumab. The candidate was being developed in a phase IIb/III INTREPID study in CD and the phase II EXPEDITION study in UC under the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development program. AstraZeneca has decided to discontinue the IBD development program on brazikumab as it believes the competitive landscape is evolving while the regulatory timeline of brazikumab has been delayed. AstraZeneca had acquired global rights to brazikumab from erstwhile Allergan, which the latter had divested in connection with its 2020 merger with AbbVie. AbbVie was funding the ongoing brazikumab study but it will now end.The FDA approved AstraZeneca and partner Merck’s Lynparza for expanded use in first-line prostate cancer. The FDA approved Lynparza in combination with J&amp;J’s Zytiga (abiraterone) and corticosteroid prednisone or prednisolone for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated mCRPC, based on data from the PROpel study. In the PROpel study, the Lynparza combination led to improved radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival in the subgroup of patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC.In April, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 11 to 1, with one abstention, in favor of approving Lynparza for the abovementioned expanded use in prostate cancer. The committee voted in favor of the FDA restricting the use of the Lynparza combination to these BRCA-mutated mCRPC patients, and not give approval for a broad range of patients with mCRPC. The FDA followed the advisory committee’s opinion.Lynparza is already approved in the European Union and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC, based on the PROpel study. In the United States, Lynparza is presently approved for homologous recombination repair gene-mutated mCRPC patients who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone based on the phase III PROfound study.Sanofi’s Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Study on Frexalimab Meets Goal: Sanofi announced data from a phase II study on its novel investigational anti-CD40L antibody, frexalimab (SAR441344) in relapsing multiple sclerosis at the annual meeting of the 2023 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). The data showed that frexalimab significantly reduced disease activity in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.Following 12 weeks of treatment with a higher dose of frexalimab, patients experienced an 89% reduction in the number of new gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) T1-lesions, compared with placebo, thereby meeting the study’s primary endpoint. A reduction of 79% in GdE T1-lesions was observed in the lower-dose treatment arm compared with placebo. Additionally, reductions were also observed in new or enlarging T2-lesions and total GdE T1-lesions in both treatment arms.Based on positive data from the phase II study, Sanofi plans to begin pivotal late-stage studies on frexalimab in multiple sclerosis in early 2024. Sanofi claims frexalimab has a unique mechanism of action as it blocks the CD40/CD40L costimulatory pathway to control MS disease activity without lymphocyte depletion.J&amp;J Seeks Approval for Single-Tablet Combo for PAH: J&amp;J submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA seeking approval for a single-tablet combination therapy of macitentan 10mg and tadalafil 40mg (M/T STCT) for the long-term treatment of PAH. J&amp;J markets macitentan 10mg under the brand name Opsumit as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of PAH. The NDA is based on positive data from J&amp;J’s phase III DUE study, which demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics (blood flow through pulmonary blood vessels) upon treatment with M/T STCT, compared to macitentan and tadalafil monotherapies in the abovementioned PAH patient population. J&amp;J believes M/T STCT has the potential to improve patient convenience by reducing their pill burden.EU Approval for Novartis’ Cosentyx for Hidradenitis Suppurativa: The European Commission approved Novartis’ drug Cosentyx for treating hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The European approval was based on data from a phase III study, which showed that treatment with Cosentyx led to rapid symptom relief from as early as Week 4, with response rates continuing to improve up to 1 year. A similar regulatory application seeking approval for Cosentyx for hidradenitis suppurativa indication is under review in the United States, with an FDA decision expected later this year. Cosentyx is presently approved for six inflammatory indications like psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis and two subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 0.58% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, Lilly rose the most (up 2.2%), while AbbVie declined the most (3.7%).In the past six months, Lilly has risen the most (18.2%), while Pfizer has declined the most (25.1%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: FDA Nod to ABBV’s Rinvoq for New Indication &amp; Other Updates)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Dividend growers become top choices for investors, especially during bearish markets, because of their ability to generate stable cash flows and return profits to shareholders. When the market was down from December 1999 to March 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points per month, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend growth is one of the most important aspects of dividend investing. It is often associated with high-quality companies that have sustainable business models and solid financial health. In addition to this, companies with proven track records of dividend growth help protect during inflationary periods. For these reasons, investors often gravitate towards some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). These companies have demonstrated strong profitability through the years, which has contributed to their ability to raise their payouts regularly.

In comparison, dividend cutters underperformed and delivered an annual average return of 3.4%.Also read: Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According to AnalystsVarious studies have shown the outperformance of reliable dividend stocks relative to other equities. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, dividend growers delivered a 12.07% annual average return from March 1972 to March 2020, compared with an 11.50% annualized return of the S&amp;P 500.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive.

A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said it has not yet set a date for the strike vote.This action comes months after pilots at Delta Air Lines ratified a contract that includes over $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.Industry officials say Delta's new contract has become a benchmark for contract negotiations in North America.""We have offered our pilots an industry leading deal and we're actively working with ALPA to reach an agreement,"" a United Airlines spokesperson said, adding that United flights will continue to operate as planned as the negotiation process continues.A move towards a strike vote is a bargaining tactic unions have been using in contract negotiations, and a strike mandate does not mean pilots will walk off the job.United's contract came up for renewal in 2019 and negotiations have been underway for five years. Last year, its pilots overwhelmingly voted against a tentative contract, which the union said fell short of what members were seeking. Since then, United pilots have been protesting for a better deal.(Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Gokul Pisharody; Editing by William Mallard)]"

(NYSE:PNC) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-ownership-shares-pnc-financial-143355237.html,1685716435,STORY,['PNC'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies PNC Financial Services Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 23 shareholders own 51% of the company Insiders have been selling lately If you want to know who really controls The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PNC Financial Services Group. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that PNC Financial Services Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of PNC Financial Services Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PNC Financial Services Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 5.1% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$181m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in PNC Financial Services Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PNC Financial Services Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for PNC Financial Services Group   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises. The company's largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company, with ownership of 23%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.4% of common stock, and A. Wilhelmsen Capital AS holds about 5.9% of the company stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Royal Caribbean CruisesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$90m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Equity OwnershipPrivate equity firms hold a 5.9% stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some investors might be encouraged by this, since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively, those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 4.5%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Royal Caribbean Cruises better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

To explore similar stocks, you can take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market.""The Winners Make No Sense""On May 9, CNBC's Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, dived into the current market dynamics to try and unravel the perplexing trends and developments we've been seeing unfold in the market so far in 2023. While bears have been whispering that a ""financial storm"" has been brewing and has ""snuck up on us,"" with a debt ceiling crisis and economic recession on the horizon, Cramer notes that the market still has not ""cratered."" Everyone seems to be confused about how the market has been ""hanging in there."" To deal with this confusion, Cramer went through several financial chart to try and spot what the ""strategists might be missing."" The answer he came to was that the stocks and sectors that have been rising seem to ""make no sense."" In fact, ""they aren't supposed to be on top all at once"" at all.Noting this perplexing phenomenon, Cramer then begins to go over various sectors and companies that had been performing well in May. While they included big-tech names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) alongside major drug companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), they also included industrials, housing, travel and leisure, and consumer packaged goods companies. With such a wide range of positively-performing sectors, especially those that are generally not up all together at the same time, Cramer began to break down what has been setting each sector apart in 2023, leading to its success.Cramer's Thoughts on Industrials and Housing StocksIn answering the question behind the success of industrials stocks even after the Fed has raised ""rates by 500 basis points in 14 months,"" Cramer noted that most leaders in this industry ""are involved in aerospace, or decarbonization, or both. He explained that the aerospace industry, being cyclical in nature and hosting ""so much pent up demand,"" is one of the key factors driving the growth being several industrials stocks. These include companies that are suppliers for ""Boeing or Air Bus, like General Electric.""Story continuesMoving on from industrials, Cramer delves deep into the housing industry and notes that historically, housing stocks ""should be at their 52-week-lows, not highs"" because ""when the Fed raises rates aggressively, these stocks are supposed to get hammered."" However, considering the ""tremendous housing shortage"" in the US, this industry has actually been incredibly successful so far in 2023. Homebuilders have also apparently ""raised prices by a gigantic amount, roughly 25% on average over the past two years."" According to Cramer, this trend has become pronounced in the housing industry because the rising demand for housing in the US has reduced the need for housing companies to offer lower prices to their customers.""Healthcare Is Running""Another industry whose success Cramer sees as an anomaly is the healthcare industry. Cramer noted that stocks operating in this sector are usually ""classic slow-down stocks that shouldn't be running at the same time as the industrials and the housing stocks,"" but this doesn't seem to be the case this year. The reason behind this development seems to be the ""new product cycles"" many drug companies are enjoying in 2023. There's also the ""emerging turn in medical devices"" as the pandemic has died down. According to Cramer, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals ""deferred non-urgent surgeries,"" so now, with the pandemic out of the way, demand for these surgeries and the devices required for them has ""come back with a vengeance.""""Pent-up demand"" is also the key factor behind the surprising success of travel and leisure stocks, according to Cramer. He noted that ""we're in a weird post-pandemic moment where everybody feels long on money and short on time."" This sense of urgency that many people in the US may feel best explains the perplexing case of the travel and leisure industry, which ""should be faltering at this stage"" but isn't.In short, Cramer helped explain the confusing market reality on his show by holding up a microscope to the performance of the companies in these industries. Considering these factors, we decided to cover the top stocks out of the ones Cramer mentioned on Mad Money.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we watched Jim Cramer's Mad Money episode from May 9, when the host gave a rundown on what stocks and sectors have been climbing the market so far in 2023. Cramer went through a range of names, including industrial companies, housing corporations, drug companies, consumer packaged goods stocks, and big tech. Of these names, we selected those that have been the most popular among hedge funds in 2023, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter. We shortlisted the top ten based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, and ranked them using this metric, from the lowest to the highest number.Stocks Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks mentioned by Cramer in his ""big-cap tech"" stocks list. These were the stocks he believes have been confusing the market with their performance so far this year because they've been rising.As of June 2, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up 42.72% year-to-date.Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer raised his price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares from $800 to $900 on June 2. The analyst also has an Outperform rating on the stock.Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was spotted in the portfolios of 72 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value was $3.5 billion.The most prominent shareholder in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) at the end of the first quarter was Citadel Investment Group, holding 1.1 million shares in the company.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC mentioned Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) contributed to performance in the quarter following the company’s solid fourth quarter 2022 results. This was driven by better-than-expected results in both its semiconductor solutions, networking and storage segments. The company also provided first quarter guidance that was ahead of consensus as well as 2023 commentary that expects earnings momentum to continue due to a strong product cycle.”9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72There were 72 hedge funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $3.7 billion.According to Cramer, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a drug company that is offering ""diabetes drugs that could be revolutionary weight loss treatments."" Because of such products, the stock ""would be going up under a strong or weak economy.""Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is up 19.59% year-to-date as of June 2.On May 26, Wells Fargo analysts raised their price target on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) from $440 to $500 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock.Fred Alger Management made the following comment about Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company with core franchises in diabetes, obesity, neurology, and oncology. The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.”Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a stock that has performed well in the current market conditions.8. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73As of June 2, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is up by 11.06% year-to-date.An Outperform rating was held on Analog Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADI) in the first quarter. Their total stake value came up to $4.9 billion.Generation Investment Management was the largest stakeholder in Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) at the end of the first quarter, holding 5.1 million shares.Here's what  First Pacific Advisors said about Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock price declined in the first half of 2022, along with its semiconductor peers. That sector has since rebounded, lifting ADI with it. We believe ADI is a well-run company and a secular grower, which should augur well for its future. However, given that it operates in a cyclical industry, we will not be surprised when its shares periodically trade down.”7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Carter Gould, an analyst at Barclays, holds an Overweight rating on Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares as of May 1.

A bigger labor pool is easing pressure on businesses to raise wages and helping decelerate inflation.""While it appears to be a hot number on the actual number of people employed, the wage rate is not increasing as fast,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""That is a softening effect and is this the mythical soft landing? Looks like that.""The data brought relief to investors who mostly expect the Fed to pause hiking rates at its policy meeting on June 13-14. It would be the first halt since the Fed started its aggressive anti-inflation policy tightening more than a year ago.But some pointed to the much hotter-than-expected jobs data as a sign the Fed still has not yet tamed inflation.""Our view is and has been that the market is completely wrong on assessing what the Federal Reserve is doing,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Hermes in New York.Story continues""The market's perception is that this economy was going to cool, inflation was going to collapse and the Fed was going to turn around and start cutting interest rates. That's wrong.""Fed funds futures showed a 71.3% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady in two weeks, down from 79.6% on Thursday, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.Markets now await data on key consumer prices a day before the Fed's rate decision in two weeks.The Senate passing a bill late on Thursday to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling avoided what would have been a catastrophic, first-ever default.Passage of the vote eased investor concerns as Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index, fell to its lowest since November 2021, down 1.1 points at 14.6 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 701.19 points, or 2.12%, to 33,762.76, the S&amp;P 500 gained 61.35 points, or 1.45%, to 4,282.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 139.78 points, or 1.07%, to 13,240.77.For the week, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.82%, the Dow added 2.02% and the Nasdaq gained 2.04%Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.05 billion shares, compared with about 10.58 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Shares of Verizon Communications Inc, AT&amp;T Inc and T-Mobile US Inc declined after a report said Amazon.com Inc was in talks with the U.S. telecoms to offer low-cost wireless services to its Prime members.Verizon slid 3.2%, while AT&amp;T and T-Mobile declined 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively; Amazon gained 1.2%.All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors advanced, with the materials index leading, up 3.4%, and the consumer discretionary sector, housing Amazon, close behind, rising 2.2%.Nvidia Corp slid 1.1% for a second day of declines after briefly entering on Wednesday the elite club of megacap stocks valued at $1 trillion or more on hopes artificial intelligence will deliver significant future returns.But Nvidia's almost 170% rise year to date highlights investors face of a market dominated by the out-performance of megacaps while most other companies tread water.""Nobody’s really explained to me how they’re going to make any money from it,"" said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management in Punta Gorda, Florida. ""A company like Nvidia going up so much in such a short period of time, that doesn't make any rational sense.""Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.75-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 40 new lows.(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal, Shristi Achar A and Shashwat Chauhan, in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Maju Samuel)]"

If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Tapestry paying out a modest 31% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 43% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Tapestry's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Tapestry's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Tapestry's dividend payments are effectively flat on where they were 10 years ago.The Bottom LineIs Tapestry worth buying for its dividend? Tapestry has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Tapestry is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Tapestry that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive.

(Photo: C.H. Robinson)C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRW) has chosen David Bozeman, an executive of the Ford Motor Co., as its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.David Bozeman (Photo: Ford)The announcement, which is expected to be made as early as Monday, catapults Bozeman to the top job of the nation’s largest freight broker.Bozeman is currently vice president of the customer services division and enthusiast brands at Ford (NYSE: F). Before joining the automaker last August, Bozeman spent five-plus years as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services. Before that, he spent more than eight years in top positions at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and more than 16 years at Harley-Davidson Motor Co. (NYSE: HOG).The choice of Bozeman may come as a surprise to many who thought that Jim Barber, a former COO at UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), to be the odds-on choice for the job. The position has been open since Bob Biesterfeld was let go at the beginning of the year.During its most recent analyst call, Robinson said a decision would be made and announced by the end of June. Company executives were not immediately available for comment.Like virtually all brokers, Robinson has struggled with a sharp downturn in demand. Robinson had also struggled in recent months amid concerns about increased competition from the likes of new broker RXO Inc. (NYSE: RXO). However, it had lost market share in general in what had before been a historically strong environment for contract brokerage, from which Robinson generates most of its revenue.Robinson also overspent significantly on personnel to support load-matching technology that executives thought would disrupt traditional brokerage but had failed to generate the expected returns on investment. One of the sources in January criticized Robinson for investing $1 billion in IT projects, including the much publicized Navisphere load-matching platform that never lived up to expectations.The post C.H.

At nearly $300 million, Dial of Destiny is one of the most expensive films ever made and initial reviews suggest it could bomb big at the box office when it lands on June 30.When Iger acquired Lucasfilm for just over $4 billion a decade ago, it paired the century-old animation company with the studio behind Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet the match made in heaven now risks becoming an albatross around Disney’s neck.The third Skywalker trilogy started off with a bang in late 2015 with The Force Awakens, only to end with a whimper four years later as fans deserted the franchise. The studio hadn’t produced a theatrical release of any kind since, allowing the Marvel Cinematic Universe—despite recent setbacks—to supplant it as Disney’s cash cow.“The Force has left Lucasfilms,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization, in an interview. “That emotional connection it enjoyed with fans has been damaged.”The Los Angeles-based media industry investor and self-admitted Star Wars fan still counts the deal a success for Iger, but he believes it got lost producing too much subpar content for Disney.Harrison Ford at the photo call for the film 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' at the 76th international Cannes film festival. (Photo by Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)At Disney, less is now more“To get the Force back, Lucasfilm needs to reconnect with its Joseph Campbell roots—the inner set of mythologies we’re all hardwired to that motivated Lucas to create Star Wars in the first place,” said Schiffer.He argues the constant hunger to feed the streaming business with fresh material helped sow the seeds for the current malaise.Even as The Mandalorian—“the series that started it all for Disney+” in Iger’s words—helped the CEO attract subscribers and catch up quickly to Netflix, it came at a cost of stretching the Star Wars brand beyond recognition.Story continuesNow that growth has faltered, with 4 million customers canceling their membership in the three months through March, and Wall Street is pushing Iger to end the scattergun approach of showering creators with money for new content. Instead, investors want him to end the over $10 billion in cumulative streaming losses since the launch of Disney+ three and a half years ago.The idea that less is often more could apply to Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones films, which enjoyed their heyday in the 1980s. Fans were largely satisfied when the titular character finished on a high note, literally riding off into the sunset at the end of the third film.And so, when Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was released fifteen years ago, the spectacle of seeing an aging Ford emerge unscathed from a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator left no one asking for more.But they will get a sequel nonetheless when Dial of Destiny swings into theaters a full 42 years after the first installment. Factoring in marketing and distribution costs, including the cinemas’ cut of receipts, it will likely have to pull in around $800 million at the box office just to break even.Franchises cannot be measured in box office receipts aloneIger didn’t come out of retirement in November just to watch his prize possessions wither on the vine. The board expects him to right the ship, breathe life back into the dormant stock and resume paying a cash dividend to shareholders.To do so, he’ll need to churn out family-friendly fare full of iconic characters and thrilling settings capable of being repurposed into immersive experiences for his amusement parks.“The value of intellectual property cannot be measured simply in a franchise’s box office receipts,” said Guy Bisson, co-founder of the media industry research firm Ampere Analysis. “You need to take into account its contribution in streaming, in merchandising, in the characters and rides at parks.”For example, Disney finance chief Christine McCarthy explained to investors something seemingly mundane as refreshments can squeeze more revenue out of each Disney World visitor if they can be turned into a Star Wars-themed experience.But Lucasfilm, which did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment, knows it is running out of excuses now that a movie based on a Nintendo video game proved you can still rake in over $1 billion post-pandemic as long as you have the right concept.For this very reason, Iger notably started off his fiscal Q2 earnings call this month by congratulating Universal for the success of Super Mario Bros: “It gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business.”Lucasfilm's first return to the theatres in years opens to poor reviewsThe pressure on Dial of Destiny to perform for the Disney CEO became apparent through a telling exchange at Cannes, which he was attending for the first time.Film critic Pete Hammond recounted Iger’s reaction when informed Deadline just published a rave review of the fifth Indiana Jones movie: “You could see the absolute relief on his face. ‘You have made me very happy to hear that,’ he told me, and he meant it.”.That’s probably because first impressions have otherwise been dreadful, with a franchise-low 50% score on Rotten Tomatoes as of writing. Vanity Fair proclaimed it “not worthy of the whip”, while the BBC felt Ford’s globe-trotting adventurer had been relegated to a background figure in his own film, included mainly for the purpose of being upstaged by younger co-star Phoebe Waller-Bridge.“I’m not sure how many fans want to see Indiana Jones as a broken, helpless old man who cowers in the corner while his patronizing goddaughter takes the lead, but that’s what we’re given, and it’s as bleak as it sounds,” the BBC wrote, branding it a “gloomy and depressing” final act.With Disney needing to shell out $9 billion at least to buy Comcast out of Hulu as early as next year, the last thing Iger needs is bad word of mouth building over the next four weeks to asphyxiate any hopes of blockbuster success.Right now, though, grim news is all that Lucasfilm has to offer the Disney CEO. An attempt to expand on the lore of its 1988 fantasy tale Willow flopped hard when the series debuted on Disney+ in November.Not only was it canceled after the first of three seasons, but the show was banished entirely from the platform as part of a thorough spring cleaning. Critics argued Willow in retrospect would have been more valuable to Disney as a tax write-off than as actual content for subscribers.Fans desert Disney Star WarsAt the heart of this mess is Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. A member of Fortune’s 2015 class of Most Powerful Women, the youthful 69-year-old is an accomplished industry veteran in her own right, producing dozens of classic feature films including Jurassic Park and E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial.Yet even being George Lucas’ hand-picked successor has not shielded her from hefty criticism. A number of fans begrudge her along with Last Jedi writer-director Rian Johnson for deconstructing Luke Skywalker in the third trilogy.Actor Mark Hamill distanced himself from the creative choices Johnson and Kennedy took with his iconic character in a rare industry rebuke.Cast member Mark Hamil attends the premiere of ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" in Los Angeles, California, U.S. December 16, 2019. REUTERS/Phil McCartenAntagonized by the perceived shabby treatment of their childhood heroes, fewer and fewer fans showed up from one movie to the next. The third and final installment, Rise of Skywalker, only took in half of the $2 billion that premiere film The Force Awakens made for Disney.It’s perhaps no wonder that the company’s $5,000-per-package Star Wars-themed hotel, the “Galactic Starcruiser”, is shutting down. The tactical mistake of placing it in the timeline of the Disney sequel trilogy doomed it to a lifespan of just 18 months after opening.Those wealthy enough to fork over thousands of dollars just to role-play their heroes tend to be middle-aged fans of the original films who want to do battle against the sinister Darth Vader they remember as kids, not the bland and forgettable Kylo Ren.Could Kennedy go?Following the disappointment of 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker, no further theatrical films got off the ground despite past proclamations.Numerous Hollywood creatives like Lost’s Damon Lindelof, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins and Thor: Ragnarok’s Taika Waititi were all reportedly attached to new Star Wars projects—to no avail. As a result, the Star Wars universe has only lived on in Disney’s streaming platform with mixed critical success.Because of the drop-off in interest, Iger and his studio boss Alan Bergman are now in a difficult position. The Disney CEO has not spared high-ranking figures like Marvel’s Ike Perlmutter or Victoria Alonso from the axe, and he has demanded results from his teams in exchange for greater creative control.""There needs to be a direct connection between what’s being spent and what’s being earned from a revenue perspective. It’s all about accountability,"" Iger said in March.Older Star Wars fans want to see Kennedy go in favor of someone like Jon Favreau, the Iron Man director and creator of The Mandalorian. Allegedly negotiations over whether to renew her contract, due to expire next year, are slated for this August.“My bet is she stays, just with a different mission,” wagers Schiffer. “The problem isn’t Kathleen Kennedy.”Everything can be fixed with the right scriptIf Indiana Jones does flop, what then? Disney is 18 months away from getting a new CEO. Could Iger’s successor, unwilling to mop up his Lucasfilm mess, consider a disposal?Unlikely, argues Ampere Analysis’ Bisson. Ingenious storytellers can always dream up more compelling Star Wars content—so long as they own the IP.“I cannot personally see Disney offloading Lucasfilm in the immediate future,” the industry expert told Fortune.Perhaps sensing the need to deliver after a long creative drought, Kennedy announced in April that not one but three new Star Wars films were in the works.Yet even those show the Lucasfilm boss is unwilling to commit to any one overarching narrative in favor of spreading her bets. The trio are conceived as separate standalone stories each set in a different period.Should any one or all three survive development and go into actual production, the damage can still be fixed with the right script and creative vision.“This is not forever. If another film turned out to be good, the fans will be there,” said Schiffer. “In fact, we’d be there first.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

If you want to skip the detailed analysis, visit 10 Best Personal Finance and Investing Blogs.Blogs about personal finance and investment offer information and instructional materials on a range of financial and investing topics. Saving, budgeting, debt management, investing tactics, retirement planning, and other subjects are covered. These blogs assist investors in staying informed, increasing their financial literacy, and making wise financial decisions. These blogs are frequently written by people with various educational backgrounds, professional experiences, and financial beliefs. Investors can examine numerous investing ideas, tactics, and opinions thanks to the diversity of perspectives. Through our take on the best personal finance and investing blogs, individuals can find resources that can help them manage their finances better.A Forbes-Advisor-commissioned survey found out that 79% of millennials and Gen Z are getting financial advice from social media. Some of the trendy platforms, in this respect, are YouTube and TikTok. However, as experts would tell you, getting financial advice from self-proclaimed ""gurus"" on TikTok is a bad start. There are many reputed personal finance and investment sites on the web where dedicated and certified experts provide sound financial/investment advice.Market OverviewMany Americans have racked up a lot of debt largely because of financial mismanagement. As of August 2022, household debt had climbed by $2 trillion since the end of 2019.According to our research, there are 64% of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck, with some not having enough money to handle a $1,000 emergency, and the impending economic downturn will only make matters worse. Individuals must handle their money wisely now more than ever.This brings us to personal financial management. It includes budgeting, debt management, investing, and retirement planning. It may also cover strategies for acquiring money, protecting it through insurance, and ensuring that it is passed on to the intended beneficiaries.Story continuesIndividuals can prepare for a debt-free life by learning how to manage their finances so they can take control of their financial concerns and have a strategy to handle the pricey shocks life can throw at them.Importance of Financial Knowledge in 2023Large businesses can hire firms as well as individuals for financial management. However, small businesses may not be able to afford such luxuries. A small business requires more funds as it grows and expands over time to support its development and growth goals.Small businesses must precisely and effectively predict and plan for their financial demands. In order to support their development objectives, business executives must pick the right sources of capital. Proper knowledge of finance will be one of the most important skills for creating long-term wealth in 2023. Being financially educated and well-informed is a must in today's rapidly evolving global economy in order to make wise investment choices and attain financial security. Thus, individuals, small businesses and investors should look for credible and reliable personal finance blogs.In addition to useful personal finance/investment advice, many finance websites also offer other real-time resources. For instance, SeekingAlpha and MarketWatch are in association with NASDAQ Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ). By providing access to the platforms of Seeking Alpha and MarketWatch, NASDAQ Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) enables investors, corporate executives, and industry professionals to access their blogs, news, and analysis. In contrast, Seeking Alpha and MarketWatch offer access to NASDAQ Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s news and blogs, further assisting readers and contributors in their research and follow-up on Nasdaq-listed firms.Investment is Key NowThe global economy will grow at a meager 1.6 percent this year, predicts J.P. Morgan Global Research, as financial circumstances become stricter. Moreover, investments in 2023 will be ""rocky,"" but those who stick with it will be rewarded. The most recent instances of an unexpected event that might frighten the markets are the collapses of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.The COVID-19 pandemic, the dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the US-China conflict, the energy crisis, and the rise in natural disasters are all accelerating the transition to a new political order that will bring with it higher inflation, increased geopolitical unpredictability, and a struggle with fiscal policies in a world already rife with debt. Investors should anticipate a worsening of economic conditions.25 Best Personal Finance and Investing BlogsDitty_about_summer/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe have ranked our list (in ascending order) based on the website traffic statistics provided by Similarweb US.

Dividend growers become top choices for investors, especially during bearish markets, because of their ability to generate stable cash flows and return profits to shareholders. When the market was down from December 1999 to March 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points per month, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend growth is one of the most important aspects of dividend investing.

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive.

211,43d1dcc7-10a6-396c-9564-2752c0922519,JNPR,2023-06-03,Why Is Qualcomm (QCOM) Up 8.7% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-qualcomm-qcom-8-7-153125023.html,1685719885,STORY,"['QCOM', 'JNPR']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Qualcomm (QCOM). Shares have added about 8.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Qualcomm due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Qualcomm Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates on Lower RevenuesQualcomm reported weak second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment, inflationary pressures and soft recovery in China, resulting in lower-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line missed the same despite the strength of the business model, revenue diversification and the ability to respond proactively to the evolving market scenario. Shares declined sharply post earnings release owing to a soft outlook due to limited market visibility and high channel inventory levels.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the March quarter declined to $1,704 million or $1.52 per share from $2,934 million or $2.57 per share in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line contraction.Quarterly non-GAAP net income came in at $2,420 million or $2.15 per share compared with $3,661 million or $3.21 per share in the year-ago quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues owing to soft demand trends. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.RevenuesOn a GAAP basis, total revenues in the fiscal second quarter were $9,275 million compared with $11,164 million in the prior-year quarter. Despite solid automotive revenues, the top line decreased on soft demand patterns and elevated inventory levels owing to market uncertainty and macroeconomic woes. High inflationary pressures and soft economic recovery in China further compounded the problems. However, Qualcomm witnessed strong momentum in IoT across consumer, edge networking and industrial sectors, along with strength in Snapdragon portfolio within the automotive sector.Non-GAAP revenues in the reported quarter were $9,268 million compared with $11,158 million in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly revenues beat the consensus mark of $9,080 million.Story continuesSegment ResultsQuarterly revenues from Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) declined 17% year over year to $7,942 million, as strength in the automotive platform was more than offset by lower demand in handsets and channel inventory drawdown within the IoT business. Despite solid potential in the EDGE networking business that helps transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets, the company witnessed lower demand owing to an uncertain landscape.Automotive revenues rose 20% to $447 million, while handset and IoT revenues were down 17% and 24%, respectively, to $6,105 million and $1,390 million. EBT margin for the QCT segment decreased to 27% from 35%.Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenues totaled $1,290 million, down 18% year over year due to lower licensing revenues. EBT margin declined to 68% from 73%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityQualcomm generated $1,457 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal second quarter compared with $2,698 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for the first half of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $4,552 million and $4,755 million. At quarter-end, the company had $3,488 million in cash and cash equivalents and $15,486 million of long-term debt. The company repurchased 7 million shares for $903 million during the quarter.Q3 GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Qualcomm expects GAAP revenues of $8.1-$8.9 billion due to rapid deterioration in demand and high channel inventory. Management expects the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, high inflation and a slower recovery in China to adversely impact demand as customers remain cautious with their purchasing decisions, further leading to inflated inventory levels. Non-GAAP earnings are projected to be $1.70-$1.90 per share, while GAAP earnings are likely to be $1.24-$1.44 per share. Revenues from QTL are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.35 billion. For QCT, the company anticipates revenues between $6.9 billion and $7.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -6.21% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Qualcomm has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. Notably, Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerQualcomm belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry. Another stock from the same industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR), has gained 7.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Juniper reported revenues of $1.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.4%. EPS of $0.48 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.Juniper is expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31%.

To see more of these stocks, you can take a look at the 5 Best Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Stocks to Buy.The past few years have been challenging for most industries, with a global pandemic on the loose followed by rising inflation and geopolitical tensions. Companies that have managed to adapt to the rapidly transforming economic environment have managed to hold on, while many others have struggled and been brought to the point of bankruptcy. Insurance companies have not been spared, being faced with macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. However, the industry has managed to remain strong through 2022 and well into 2023, according to several outlook reports on the global insurance industry for 2023.A Bright Future for the Insurance IndustryAccording to one such outlook report published by Deloitte in June, insurance companies that have managed to transition during the pandemic to be able to host remote workforces and virtual customer and distributor engagement seem to be well-positioned to profit in the face of the many challenges they are facing. It has been noted in the report that reliance on advanced technology and digital infrastructure will take insurance companies a long way in meeting their goals and turning a profit. However, they must also retain their creativity in adapting to the new environment while pledging their support to sustainability priorities like climate risk, diversity and inclusion, and social equity. In a market where customers and consumers are easily swayed by socioeconomic issues, most companies are beginning to have to deal with more socially aware and concerned customers. Hence, by focusing more on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, insurance companies can continue to retain their profitability in today's uncertain market.An example of ESG priorities having an impact on the insurance industry comes with the London insurance market. According to the Deloitte report, this market could double in size by covering the global transition to green energy for policyholders who want to achieve net zero carbon emissions. According to the London &amp; International Insurance Brokers' Association (LIIBA), by 2023, buyers around the world are expected to spend about $125 billion in insurance-related transition costs. This figure alone speaks volumes about the vast potential within the ESG space, which insurance companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), and Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) can harness and utilize for their growth.Story continuesThe Property and Casualty Insurance MarketAccording to another outlook report published by McKinsey &amp; Company in March, personal property and casualty insurance has seen an annual growth of 3% between 2019 and 2022. This growth was witnessed despite the sector slowing down during the pandemic. According to the report, in 2022, the insurance industry's gross written premium (GWP) crossed the $6.5 trillion mark, and about one-third of its total revenues were derived from property and casualty insurance. However, a quick study of this sector within the broader insurance industry shows that personal property and casualty insurance is restricted to a local level, requiring insurance companies within this space to maintain a strong presence within specific regions.According to the McKinsey report, the market for property and casualty insurance is concentrated and restricted to the top five insurers operating in the US. These companies thus claim 56% and 61% of the five-year growth and pre-tax income, respectively, while they make up only about 48% of the total market share within the property and casualty insurance space. However, this concentration is not limited to the US alone. The report shows that this trend is replicated across most geographical areas, including Italy, France, Japan, and many other countries.While this market concentration remains the reality for most regions when it comes to their personal property and casualty insurance sectors, it cannot be denied that this sector remains a strong and resilient part of their economies to date. Its continued growth and profitability have led to many investors continuing to pour investments into companies operating within this space. As such, we have compiled a list of the best property and casualty insurance stocks to buy today.Best Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Stocks to BuyAigars Reinholds/Shutterstock.comLet's now take a look at the 10 best property and casualty insurance stocks to buy.Our MethodologyWe have selected 10 of the most popular property and casualty insurance stocks among elite hedge funds.

The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE:THG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE:THG) is a provider of property and casualty insurance products and services.

This gives Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) an upside potential of 21.46%.Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 23 hedge funds long Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL). Their total stake value was $1.1 billion.Investment management firm, Davis Advisers, mentioned the company in its 2022 annual investor letter. Here's what the firm said:“As the relative risk/reward trade-off has shifted back toward our bank holdings, the fund has reallocated some capital away from P&amp;C insurance, though it still remains a meaningful position at 17%. A closer look at one of those holdings, Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) Corporation, illustrates why. Referred to by some as a “mini-Berkshire Hathaway,” Markel allocates its capital between writing P&amp;C insurance, investing in publicly traded stocks, purchasing controlling interest in private companies and repurchasing its own stock. Such flexibility conveys an advantage over those who limit themselves to one or two of those options. It also complicates the analysis of the company by investors, and despite its $18 billion market capitalization, Markel is covered by relatively few brokerage analysts. Insurance companies in general earn two streams of profits: the profit (loss) from underwriting clients’ risks, and the investment income generated from assets financed with the float provided by their customers (and their own capital). Markel has a demonstrated record as a highly competent underwriter, illustrated by management’s targeted underwriting margin of 10% in the medium-term, an outcome that would translate into an attractive mid-teens return on equity if it were conventionally structured.But Markel is not conventional: It carries far more equity capital than its insurance operations need on a standalone basis, and that excess is allocated to stocks and owned private companies. Markel is projected to earn $1.25 billion of net income in 20236, but this metric only captures the dividends received on its $8 billion stock portfolio. The underlying companies in that portfolio—which include Berkshire Hathaway, Deere &amp; Co., Home Depot and Alphabet, among others—earn perhaps $350 million more than they pay out in dividends.7 Moreover, these companies are reinvesting much of that into their own businesses at attractive rates of return, which over time will materialize into stock price appreciation. Adjusting Markel’s reported earnings for these retained earnings would decrease its 2023 valuation multiple from 14 times to 11 times. Furthermore, the contribution to this adjusted measure of earnings from these stocks and from the approximate $2 billion invested in private companies is roughly 45% of the total. These are non-financial businesses that generally command higher valuation multiples than typical financial companies.…” (Click here to read the full text)6. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.

Shares have added about 0.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Gibraltar Industries due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Gibraltar’s Q1 Earnings &amp; Net Sales Beat, Margins RiseGibraltar Industries reported solid earnings in first-quarter 2023. Quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis. Although net sales decreased from the previous year, it beat the consensus mark.Looking forward, chairman and CEO Bill Bosway, said, “As we head into the second quarter, customer bookings and demand across the business is shaping up as anticipated, and our businesses are on track for a solid second quarter. As committed coming into the year, we remain laser-focused on driving growth, margin expansion, and strong cash performance.”Inside the HeadlinesGibraltar reported adjusted earnings of 70 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents by 12.9% and increasing 16.7% year over year. This was driven by strong contributions from the Renewables, Agtech and Infrastructure segments.Net sales of $293.3 million outpaced the consensus mark of $289 million by 1.4% but decreased 7.7% from the prior-year level of $317.9 million. The decline was due to the end-market dynamics in the Renewables segment, and customer rescoping and reprioritizing fruit and vegetable growing projects in the Agtech business. On an adjusted basis, the top line declined 8% year over year to $290.8 million.Segmental DetailsRenewable Energy: Net sales in the segment decreased 24.9% from the year-ago quarter to $59.2 million. The U.S. solar industry continued to manage through panel importation challenges resulting from the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). Adverse weather conditions (the lowest seasonal quarter of the year) affected the top line. The backlog was up 34% sequentially.The adjusted operating margin of 3.8% expanded a whopping 920 basis points (bps) year over year, driven by field operations productivity and improved supply-chain management that offset lower volumes. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased 1,020 bps from the prior-year quarter to 7.8%.Residential Products: Net sales in the segment were flat year over year to $179.5 million. The positive impact of participation gains and the acquisition of Quality Aluminum Products or QAP were offset by headwinds of channel inventory correction, the market’s return to normal seasonal demand, and adverse winter weather in key regions of the United States. QAP contributed 8% to sales growth. Organic revenues remained challenged (down 8%), as the market returned to its typical lower seasonal demand patterns. The adjusted operating margin of 16.5% contracted 230 bps in the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin fell 190 bps from the prior-year quarter to 18.1%.Agtech: Sales declined 15.3% year over year to $35.9 million and adjusted sales fell 18% to $33.3 million. The downside was due to the produce customers' rescope, and reprioritize the launch of fruit and vegetable growing facilities. Backlogs were down 31% from the year-ago quarter and 3% sequentially. The adjusted operating margin improved 440 bps year over year to 10.7%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was up 510 bps year over year to 14%.Infrastructure: Sales in the segment rose 8.7% year over year to $18.7 million. Backlog rose 38% year over year on strong demand. The company expects the infrastructure bill to have a positive impact in 2023. The adjusted operating margin of 14.5% expanded 800 bps year over year. The adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 760 bps from the prior-year quarter to 18.9%. The upside was driven by strong 80/20 execution, volume, and supply-chain productivity.Story continuesOperating HighlightsAdjusted operating profit also grew 14% to $31 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 210 bps year over year to 10.6%.Adjusted EBITDA rose 14% to $39 million in the reported period. The adjusted EBITDA margin also increased 260 bps from the prior year to 13.4%.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2023, Gibraltar had liquidity of $351 million, including cash and cash equivalents worth $7.5 million compared with $17.6 million at the 2022-end. Long-term debt was $49.9 million, up from $88.8 million as of Dec 31, 2022.In the first quarter, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $38 million versus net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million in the prior year. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 153,537 shares for $7.4 million at an average price of $47.99 per share.2023 GuidanceGibraltar expects revenues of $1.36-$1.41 billion, whereas it reported $1.39 billion in 2022. Adjusted earnings are expected to be $3.46-$3.66 per share, suggesting a rise from the $3.40 reported in 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Gibraltar Industries has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision looks promising. Notably, Gibraltar Industries has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerGibraltar Industries is part of the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry.

The move came a day after leaders of the G7 industrial democracies agreed to new initiatives to push back against Chinese economic coercion.Micron subsequently predicted a revenue reduction.McCaul and Gallagher urged Raimondo to work with Japan and South Korea to ensure that companies from those countries ""do not take market share lost to the ban and undercut Micron."" The lawmakers added that China ""lashed out with an arbitrary economic embargo against one American company. Now, the United States must ensure that this economic aggression fails.""The Commerce Department must rally U.S. partners and allies, they said.""We must quickly work with Japan and South Korea to ensure Japanese and South Korean companies do not undercut Micron by taking its sales that were lost to the PRC's unjustifiable boycott,"" they added, referring to the People's Republic of China.Raimondo on Saturday said the United States will not tolerate China's action and is working closely with allies to address such ""economic coercion.""Story continuesThe Chinese Embassy in Washington and a spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.McCaul and Gallagher said China's action against Micron ""should not deter but should rather invigorate export control actions against PRC companies that may threaten U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,"" like Chinese memory chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies.""Failure to impose a cost upon the PRC for its malign behavior will only invite further such conduct,"" they added.Reuters has reported Gallagher previously urged Raimondo to put trade curbs on Changxin Memory after Beijing's actions against Micron.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Graco Inc. GGG, Lifetime Brands, Inc. LCUT and American International Group, Inc. AIG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Nova is a $3 billion provider of technology for semiconductor manufacture that makes integrated hardware and software tools and systems for the necessary ""purity &amp; precision"" of silicon engineering.Here's how the company describes their mission...Nova's advanced multidisciplinary dimensional metrology technologies combine complex opto-mechanical hardware with advanced optics and cutting-edge algorithms to continuously innovate for effective process control throughout the semiconductor fabrication life cycle.After a growth lull, Nova is back to a Zacks #1 Rank as revenues and profits have turned around since their Q1 report in early May.NOVA LTD, formerly known as NOVA MEASURING, is based in REHOVOT, Israel.Quarter Details and Stock Reaction in the AI BoomNova delivered Q1 earnings of $1.23 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 per share by 18%. This compares to earnings of $1.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of monitoring systems used in chip manufacturing would post earnings of $1.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.28, delivering a surprise of 2.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Nova, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $132.19 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $133.96 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.Jefferies analyst Vedvati Shrotre initiated coverage of Nova with a Buy rating and $115 price target in April as part of a broader research note on Semi Cap Equipment. The firm favors the company as an ""optical metrology pure-play"" and a Foundry/Logic beneficiary, forecasting its revenues to grow at a CAGR of 8% over the next 5 years. As a pure front-end play, Nova has the highest margins relative to Onto and Camtek, the analyst told investors in a research note.Story continuesWhere Does NVMI Fit In the Semi/AI Ecology?Metrology is the science of measurement and nowhere is precision more needed than in the ""nanosphere"" of chip manufacture. A nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter, and this is the distance of measurement for engineering transistors onto an integrated circuit (IC) board or card.Chips have been plunging below 10nm for the past few years as Moore's Law gets new life from GPU pioneers like NVIDIA. For comparison, the coronavirus is about 50nm.I explained some of this in my Top Stock Picks video about Nova on Tuesday, where I also suggested that this little engineer of Semi precision and purity may be an acquisition target for larger wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research or KLA.For less than $10 billion, any of these $50-100 billion Semi engineers could ""bolt-on"" Nova and secure their dominance in precision purity manufacturing.You Can't Spell Innovation Sans NOVABe sure to watch the video I made Tuesday (link here) to see inside the world of precision Semi manufacture.Until you do, here was a recent press release from NOVA that highlights their expertise...Rehovot, Israel, December 20, 2022 – Nova (Nasdaq: NVMI) announced today that a leading global logic manufacturer recently selected Nova ELIPSON™ for next-generation integrated circuit (IC) development.Nova ELIPSON™ was chosen for its ability to perform in-die characterization of stress, strain, and defectivity in next-generation devices, rapidly and with unparalleled sensitivity. The solution utilizes advanced Raman spectroscopy technology to extract materials properties of in-die structures, by fast and non-destructive means. The platform has consistently proven its ability to solve a wide range of materials metrology challenges in various segments and steps.“This selection by one of the world’s leading semiconductor logic manufacturers demonstrates the growing value of Nova’s innovative materials metrology portfolio,” stated Eitan Oppenhaim, Nova’s president and CEO. “The increasing complexity of device architecture demands solutions that push the envelope and address the unique challenges our customers are facing. In this complex process fabrication environment, Nova’s unique materials portfolio is becoming critical to the successful manufacturing of next-generation devices.”This is one example of how sales growth is returning for this small player in the $10 trillion market for AI.Disclosure: I own shares of NVMI, NVDA, and CDNS for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Bear of the Day:Micron Technology (MU) became a Zacks #5 Rank this spring as EPS estimates collapsed for the current fiscal year, which ends in August, from a loss of $2.28 to a loss of $4.71.That earnings drawdown would represent a 156% annual decline for the ""megalodon of memory"" if it unfolds as projected.What many investors don't realize is how integral Micron memory innovations are to the AI revolution across multiple platforms including mobile, autos, medicine, robotics and the datacenter.Besides the traditional volatility of commoditized memory chips and supply chain constraints, which delivered a 189% EPS miss for the February quarter, Micron has been dealing with higher pressure from China.Sales restrictions on Micron's products in China can be seen as a retaliatory action by the red state against the U.S. government's increasing restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology.Here's an excerpt from our May 22 reporting...Micron Faces Restrictions for Selling Products in ChinaMicron has been imposed with a trade restriction by the Cyberspace Administration of China on selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns. In a statement, China’s cybersecurity regulator revealed that the U.S.-based memory chipmaker has failed to pass a cybersecurity review, which it had initiated in late March 2023.The development can be seen as a retaliatory action by the Chinese government against the U.S. government’s increasing restrictions on Chinese access to critical and more advanced semiconductor technology.In October 2022, the United States imposed an export ban on certain advanced chips that are used in data centers for artificial intelligence, data analytics and computing applications. Over the past few months, the Netherlands and Japan also joined the United States to restrict China from making advanced chips.The tit-for-tat actions could jeopardize Micron’s prospects, which are already facing the brunt of the weak demand for its memory chips. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.In late March, Micron reported weaker-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $1.91 per share, which was significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 67 cents. The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.14 per share.The quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 53% year over year to $3.69 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $3.76 billion. The rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.The memory chip maker has offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen and a chip packaging facility in the city of Xian. In early 2022, Micron announced that it would shut down DRAM design operations at its Shanghai facility by the end of the year. The move was seen as a strategic shift from the manufacturing of chips back to the United States amid mounting trade tensions between the United States and China.But MU is not the only semiconductor company that has been impacted by the tech war between the world’s two largest economies.On Aug 31, 2022, NVIDIA disclosed that the U.S. government informed it on Aug 26 about imposing a new licensing requirement, effective immediately, for its A100, A100X and forthcoming H100 integrated circuit sales in China and Russia. The government also banned NVIDIA from exporting DGX or any other systems that incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.The new licensing requirements will also be implied for any future chip designs developed by NVIDIA that have a threshold greater than or equivalent to A100. Additionally, any systems developed in the future incorporating the aforementioned types and thresholds will fall under export restrictions.Bottom line: MU appears a strong value near $65 as it trades under 4X forward sales projections of $20 billion. We just need to see how this cycle plays out with new pressure from China. The Zacks Rank will let you know.Additional content:3 Stocks to Buy for the Long TermMost investors have heard and read about Warren Buffett and his successful strategy of investing for the long term. And most also know how unnerving it gets when your holdings drop in value even as you patiently look to the horizon. Therefore, no matter how rewarding it may ultimately turn out to be, this game is not for everyone.But just suppose you were one of these patient folks: how should you go about doing this? What are the basic steps to follow or things to keep in mind?First, do your research. This includes looking at the company's financial statements, reading analyst reports and following news about the company. The goal is to have a clear understanding about the company's business model, industry position, financial performance, competitive advantages and growth prospects.Second, evaluate the financial health. Examine the company's financial statements, checking for things like revenue growth, profitability, debt levels and cash flow. Look for consistent revenue and earnings growth, a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow generation.Third, consider industry trends. Analyze the industry's growth potential, competitive landscape and any potential risks or challenges. Look for industries with favorable long-term prospects and companies that are well-positioned within those industries.Fourth, assess the stock's valuation relative to its intrinsic value. You could use valuation metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, or discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Look for stocks that are trading at a reasonable or discounted valuation compared to their potential.Fifth, diversify. The importance of a diverse portfolio can't be overstressed. Your portfolio should be balanced across growth profiles and risk profiles; between steady, mature industries and fast growing industries. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of any individual stock's performance on your overall portfolio.Sixth, rebalance your portfolio. Just because you’re holding stocks for the long term doesn’t mean that you stop monitoring and reviewing. You must make adjustments when things play out differently from what you were expecting. Also, you may need to sell a few stocks for your cash needs and compensate with other purchases. It’s important to follow closely all developments related to the stocks you’re holding. Rebalancing your portfolio helps you stay in touch with your long-term investment objectives.Finally, don't panic-sell. The stock market is volatile and there will be times when the market takes a downturn. It's important to stay calm. If you sell your stocks when the market is down, you're likely to lock in your losses. Patience pays, as long as the long-term investment story remains.Here’s a quick formula to evaluate long-term holdings:Using the Zacks stock ranking system, identify #1 (Strong Buy) rated stocks. Check their performance over the last few years. Ideally, you should be looking at revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. But a good average earnings growth rate (say at least 10%) could serve as a proxy. Add to this the analyst- expected growth rate for the next 3-5 years (if the growth rate is at least same as in the last 3-5 years, it’s an indication of steady growth for a prolonged period of time). So we can keep this too at a minimum of 10%. If such a company also pays a dividend, all the better.One stock that passes all these tests is Graco Inc. This provider of equipment and systems used to measure, move, control, spray and dispense fluid and powder materials supplies industrial manufacturers.The reason it looks so good now is that it has a five-year historical record of 10.6% earnings growth. Analysts expect the company to grow its earnings by 10% on average in the next 3-5 years, And in the current year, it is expected to grow 16.2%. It also pays a small dividend that yields 1.23%.Another stock on this list is Lifetime Brands, Inc., which is known for its kitchenware, tableware and other household products.The company has seen earnings growth of 54.9% in the last five years and is expected to grow at 14.0% over the next five years. This year alone it will grow 93.6%. To top it all, its dividend yields a very decent 3.47%.Similarly, American International Group, Inc., which offers insurance products for commercial, institutional and individual customers primarily in North America, has grown 30.5% in the last five years and is expected to grow 10.0% in the next five. It is currently expected to grow 44.6% this year. Its dividend yields 2.42%.All of these stocks carry a Zacks #1 rank, indicating upside potential even in the near term.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Rowe Price has scaled business and expanded its operations through numerous acquisitions. In December 2021, it acquired Oak Hill Advisors, L.P. (OHA) to bulk up its offerings in the alternative investment market space.Recently, in April 2023, it acquired Retiree, a fintech firm which provides innovative retirement income planning software. This will expand its existing retirement capabilities, enable a comprehensive suite of retirement income solutions for investors and practitioner tools for financial professionals.Organic growth remains a key strength at T. Rowe Price, with revenues rising over the years. The company also remains focused on enhancing investment capabilities, broadening distribution reach and improving its individual-investor-client experience.Revenue growth has been supported by its diversified assets under management (AUM) across asset classes and client base. TROW has a solid AUM balance which has been growing over the years. However, the trend declined in first-quarter 2023 due to weaker markets.Nonetheless its strong brand, consistent investment track record and decent business volumes will support AUM growth. We estimate AUM balance to grow 3.1% in the current year.On the flip side, T. Rowe Price’s bottom-line growth continues to suffer from rising costs. Also, overdependence on investment advisory fees and U.S. equity assets amid expectations of economic slowdown are concerning. Nonetheless, a solid AUM balance, business diversification and global reach are likely to support TROW’s growth.Over the past three months, shares of TROW have lost 4.5% compared with the industry’s fall of 10.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTROW currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:UPS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United Parcel ServiceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, for US$10m worth of shares, at about US$190 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$170. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.United Parcel Service insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. United Parcel Service insiders own about US$108m worth of shares (which is 0.07% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At United Parcel Service Tell Us?The fact that there have been no United Parcel Service insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the United Parcel Service insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for United Parcel Service you should be aware of.But note: United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Shares have lost about 6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NiSource due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.NiSource Q1 Earnings In Line With Estimates, Sales BeatNiSource Inc. reported first-quarter 2023 operating earnings per share of 77 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved 2.7% from the year-ago quarter’s recorded figure of 75 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company reported EPS of 71 cents compared with 94 cents in the prior-year period.Total RevenuesOperating revenues of $1,966 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,935 million by 1.6%.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism, led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its product development activities, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and production bottlenecks persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 152.7% compared with 1% growth of the industry and the 3.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $3.21 billion. The company projects 10.1% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and broke even in the other two, the average surprise being 3.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. On its first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, PacBio’s management stated that the Revio system had been reviving legacy PacBio customers' interest in leveraging long-reads. This includes the Weill Cornell Medical Center, which ordered Revio for its genomic score.In January, the company announced a collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Graduate School of Medicine to study the use of long-read sequencing and novel bioinformatics methods to better understand the genetic causes of certain rare diseases in individuals and cohorts within the Japanese population.Product Development Activities: We are optimistic about PacBio's solid potential in the RNA-sequencing market, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. On its first-quarter 2023 earnings call, PacBio’s management stated that the demand for its new Revio system continued to be robust, with orders in the first quarter outpacing its shipments of Revio, resulting in a net increase of instrument backlog.Story continuesIn April, PacBio announced the availability of its new high-throughput Nanobind DNA Extraction kits, another key product from its Circulomics acquisition.Strong Q1 Results: PacBio saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong revenues from Instrument and Consumables in the first quarter of 2023. Solid performances in Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa regions were also recorded. Continued strong prospects of the Revio and Onso systems, with customers placing orders for these, looked promising for the stock.DownsidesProduction Bottlenecks: PacBio must successfully manage new product introductions and transitions, including the Single Molecule, Real-Time Cell 8M and Sequel II/IIe Systems. However, the company may incur high costs during these transitions, which may not result in the anticipated benefits.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a flat estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has remained stable at $1.24.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $40.3 million, suggesting a 13.7% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Or we hire new employees — we do all the work to train them and they go in the yard and the guys say, ‘Why are you working here? They treat you like crap, you should leave, [and] by the way, they want to get rid of you.’ That’s the environment that we have had and we have to break out of it.”He continued, “We have to break out of it because if we don’t serve our customers better, if you don’t have the right employees, if we don’t have a sustainable culture where people want to work in the railroad like they used to, we’re not going to ever profitably grow. And we need to grow for the economy, for society, for the climate and for our own expectations around returns for our shareholders. And that’s where we bring it all together.”Hinrichs was just one of the Class I railroad leaders who addressed labor and customer relationships at the industry conference.Hinrichs told conference attendees that he doesn’t see a conflict between treating employees well and treating customers well because acting on one intention feeds the other. He pointed to CSX’s improving service metrics in the first quarter — improvements that warranted the Surface Transportation Board to lift some of the data reporting requirements implemented in 2022 in response to service deterioration at four U.S. Class I railroads — and record profits in the first quarter. These events occurred even as CSX was negotiating sick leave agreements with some of its unions, although Hinrichs noted that there is still some way to go to fully repair relationships with CSX’s workforce.Story continues“We’re a service business and you cannot run a healthy, good service business without your employees being engaged and feeling motivated to serve. And frankly, our industry has not provided that environment for our employees.”Alan Shaw, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC), echoed Hinrichs’ comments about focusing on customers as a way to grow revenue, which in turn helps the company longer term.“You can actually improve your margins by growing your revenue. So that’s our focus. It’s no longer an intense, near-term focus on operating margins for just cost cuts, but a longer-term approach,” Shaw said. “If you’re going to grow, you figure out what strategic assets am I going to need. … What do we want our franchise to look like five years from now, 10 years from now? What assets do we know we are going to need through the economic cycles, which are going to happen? Generally, for us, it’s track, locomotives, it’s investments in intermodal terminals, it’s investments in freight cars that help us compete with truck, it’s technology and people.”While labor-management relations within the industry have garnered media attention, that relationship building also can occur through workplace mentorships and cultivating the next generation of talent already working within the industry, according to those speaking on a panel on racial diversity.“One thing that I have never forgotten is that it’s my responsibility to look in the shops, in the plants and the offices and say, who’s of a different caliber that you could help? Because what they did for me — not only that they changed my life, but my kids have a better life,” said Rick Galvan. Galvan is senior vice president at Greenbrier Rail Services (NYSE: GBX). “If you don’t walk away with anything else today, I challenge you to go back to your organization and figure out who you’re going to pull up. Give them that opportunity.”Said Torri Stuckey, who was moderating the panel, “In order for you, as an organization, to make sure everybody feels valued, included, respected and appreciated, all diversity strands have to be explored.” Stuckey works as head of merchandise sales and marketing for CSX.“And diversity is not a destination. It is a journey. And it’s one that is ever evolving. So you never actually get to that destination. But we’re all in different stages of our journey as individuals and as organizations. And so today, we don’t come bearing all the answers, or any answers for that matter. It’s really just to have a public conversation to keep the conversation going,” Stuckey said.The panelists also remarked that this was the first time to their knowledge that NARS hosted such a panel at an annual conference.Repairing the industry’s imageHow the rail industry is being perceived in the broader public is another area where the railroads can improve, some speakers said. The contentious ending of the collective bargaining process last fall, highly visible incidents such as the Feb. 3 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio, and the perception that the Class I railroads are raking in billions in profit but are not investing that back into improving service or working conditions are some of the challenges that the industry is facing.Where industry stakeholders might start is by using stories to relay the importance of railroading to the broader public, according to S. Dilla Thomas, who kicked off the NARS conference. Popularly known as a Chicago historian on TikTok, Thomas said social media has helped him to educate the public on Chicago’s prominence in the history of American manufacturing.Shaw, who has received flak for how he and NS handled the East Palestine train derailment, emphasized a narrative that focuses on personal connection.“We’re taking it step by step and we’re doing the next right thing each and every day. And that’s all you can do in a crisis is be visible. Be personal. And be connected,” Shaw said.“We understand that the financial commitment that we’re making in the community is important. We’ve already committed over $35 million just to help the community recover and help the community thrive,” Shaw continued. “But that’s just a piece of it. I think what’s even more important is that personal involvement. So I go back almost every week. I’ve made actually a lot of friends up there. I call them or text, though they reach out to me when I’m not there.“And generally it’s not about the money that Norfolk Southern is providing. It really is about Norfolk Southern’s personal connection to the community. That’s what they want. They want to know that we’re going to be there, that we’re not just going to cut a check and walk away. … We have to be there. We have to show we care.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inboxClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:STB chair blasts Class I railroads for head count reductionsShaw: NS is ‘going to be the gold standard in safety’Union organizer to railroads: ‘It doesn’t have to be this way’The post Freight rail leaders realize relationship rebuilding required appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Dividend growers become top choices for investors, especially during bearish markets, because of their ability to generate stable cash flows and return profits to shareholders. When the market was down from December 1999 to March 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points per month, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend growth is one of the most important aspects of dividend investing.

In addition to this, companies with proven track records of dividend growth help protect during inflationary periods. For these reasons, investors often gravitate towards some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).

Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12.

244,622ec2f2-2348-368a-8148-e3d8d86daa92,KO,2023-06-03,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-trending-stock-130012053.html,1685710812,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -5.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The $45.02 billion and $47.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.7% and +5.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Land and Timber Stocks To Buy. Horizon Kinetics is an investment adviser managed by Murray Stahl that focuses on discovering investment prospects that are often overlooked or undervalued by the broader market. Their approach is research-oriented and involves conducting extensive analysis to identify enduring trends and potential investment themes. The firm places particular emphasis on the significance of owning tangible assets like timberland, farmland, and intellectual property, which they believe can generate consistent returns over an extended period. In this article, we delve into Horizon Kinetics’ 1st Quarter Commentary, which provides insights into various topics such as the banking crisis, diverse asset classes, different business models including land, a comparison between gold and cryptocurrencies, and the potential regulatory challenges faced by cryptocurrencies.The Silicon Valley Bank CrisisThe Federal Reserve is currently facing circumstances that extend far beyond the scope of the Taylor rule. In economics, the Taylor rule proposes that the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates when there is high inflation or when employment reaches its peak level. Conversely, interest rates should be lowered when employment levels and inflation rates are low. Horizon Kinetics noted that one of these circumstances is the recent banking crisis, which commenced with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on March 10. SVB, with assets comparable to Morgan Stanley and one-third larger than American Express, was the 16th largest bank in the United States. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was compelled to intervene and order the closure of SVB when the bank depleted its cash reserves and became unable to meet withdrawal demands from depositors. Interestingly, unlike previous instances, the bank's downfall was not attributed to credit losses. Just three weeks prior, the Forbes 2023 edition of America's Best Banks had ranked SVB as the 20th best bank in terms of operating efficiency and profitability ratios, indicating effective management. It is crucial to recognize that this issue is not specific to SVB but represents a systemic problem affecting the entire banking industry, with SVB serving as a convenient example. Story continuesAn additional issue affecting the entire system, triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to increase short-term interest rates, is the emergence of immediate and interchangeable competition for depositors of banks. These depositors had previously endured periods of minimal or zero interest rates offered by banks. Hence, even prior to the collapse of SVB, there had been a significant outflow of deposits from the banking system. It is important to note that attempting to extrapolate a few weeks or months of data, as shown in the accompanying table, to an annualized basis is a significant distortion. Nonetheless, deposit outflows from banks had been persisting for at least a year and intensified in the weeks leading up to these events.Banks and Real EstateBanks currently hold trillions of dollars in commercial real estate loans. Horizon Kinetics data suggests that as of the end of 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, one category of these loans had a U.S. office vacancy rate of 11.4%. However, by September 2022, this rate had increased to 15.4%. Despite this increase, it has not posed significant issues thus far, as delinquency and charge-off rates for commercial real estate loans have remained low during this period. Nonetheless, during a crisis, these rates can escalate significantly. At the end of last year, the delinquency and charge-off rates for commercial real estate loans were 0.68% and 0.04%, respectively. In the first quarter of 2010, these rates were much higher, at 8.92% and 2.1%, respectively. If the currently low delinquency rate were to reverse for any reason, it would result in severe financial difficulties.Best Land and Timber Stocks To BuyPhoto by Gary Ellis on UnsplashWhat Comprises a Land Company? Land is a business asset with the longest lifespan, and it may be the only asset that can last almost indefinitely. The value of land also increases due to its growing scarcity as the global population continues to rise. Arable land per person is consistently decreasing worldwide. Moreover, land has the ability to transition into progressively higher-value uses over time. For instance, grazing pasture can be transformed into farmland, which can later be integrated into an expanding urban area. On the outskirts of a city, a warehouse can be converted into an office park, while within the city, a low-rise building's plot can be repurposed into a towering office structure. Investing in land involves embracing the fact that while it can yield substantial returns in the long run, the process of value appreciation can be extremely protracted. It is not uncommon for individuals to wait their entire lives to see a significant return on their real estate investments. Many become disenchanted with the investment before the slow process of compounding can yield results. Nevertheless, land has the potential to be an exceptional vehicle for long-term returns and as a hedge against inflation. One may argue that the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry and home builders serve as comparable alternatives to investing in land. However, Horizon Kinetics pointed out that there are key distinctions to consider. REITs own various properties such as office buildings, homes, storage facilities, or malls, and their income primarily stems from the activities and operations associated with these properties, rather than from the land itself. It is important to note that REITs are required to distribute a significant portion of their income as dividends, limiting the potential for internal compounding through reinvestment or share repurchases. Additionally, they rely on external funding, often through debt and share issuances, to finance expansion, which can make them sensitive to credit and interest rate fluctuations and dilute shareholder returns.Regarding home builders, while they may acquire land for their projects, this land is typically held as inventory and used for relatively near-term purposes. The land is converted into operational assets and is not retained solely for its land value. Acquiring land for homebuilding can be costly and challenging, particularly during economic upswings. Furthermore, the homebuilding industry often involves debt leverage, which contributes to its short-term cyclical nature.An Iconic Land Company There is a land company that has been publicly traded for over a century, making it the fourth-longest listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. What sets this land company apart is its stability, as it has not undergone any significant recapitalizations, acquisitions, or ownership changes that would complicate return calculations. The results are truly remarkable. The initial stock price was $20 per share, and nearly 40 years later in 1927, it reached $2,000, becoming the highest-priced company on the Exchange at that point. Today, the share price is 286,857 times higher than the initial $20, which would equate to a staggering $5.7 million per share if there were no stock splits. This exceptional land company is known as Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL). While it is commonly categorized as an energy sector company, it was originally classified under ""Real Estate Trust &amp; Land Stocks"" in financial newspapers' quotation sections, per the Horizon Kinetics report. Challenges Associated with the REIT FrameworkThe Horizon Kinetics report also discussed that the REIT structure often appears to function as a means to raise significant amounts of external capital from equity investors and lenders, which is then converted into dividend payments. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of the potential growth is often transferred to investors in the form of equity offering fees and interest expenses. While growth can be achieved during periods of high equity valuations through the issuance of new shares to fund beneficial acquisitions, this growth is dependent on capital market pricing rather than inherent in the business model. Additionally, the debt incurred in this process introduces significant cyclical risk.Timberland REITs, on the other hand, can take advantage of the inflationary benefits associated with land ownership. There are a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, similar to corporate land companies and homebuilders, timberland REITs already possess extensive land holdings, eliminating the need for additional land purchases. Secondly, while they are required to distribute a majority of their income, they have an inherent source of internal growth: the annual growth of timber. This growth comes at virtually no input cost as it is primarily driven by solar power. In fact, trees are perhaps the only large-scale commercial application of solar power that does not require energy-conversion capital equipment like solar panels.With this outlook in mind, we discuss some of the best land and timber stocks to buy. These include Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), The Howard Hughes Corporation (NYSE:HHC), and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY). Our Methodology We listed down the best land and timber stocks from Horizon Kinetics’ 1st Quarter Commentary, where the firm highlighted the top companies operating in the sector. The following performance and acreage figures are taken directly from the Horizon report. We also selected some of the land and timber companies below based on hedge fund sentiment towards each stock as of Q1 2023. The REITs included in this list own substantial land which consistently gains value over time, in addition to generating income from rental leases. This is why they are classified as land stocks, as explained in the Horizon report. Best Land and Timber Stocks To Buy12. PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/APrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF) holds the title of being Canada's largest non-government landholder, owning a vast expanse of 9.7 million acres in western Canada. To put it into perspective, this land is roughly equivalent to the combined size of New Jersey and Massachusetts. If PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF)’s royalty interests in government-owned land are included, the total land ownership extends to an impressive 18.3 million acres. PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF) follows a business model that prioritizes an anti-dilutive capital allocation strategy over the long term. This approach is a management decision. PrairieSky's shares offer a dividend yield of 4.6%, which could potentially be higher. However, the company maintains a low payout ratio in order to have enough cash flow for both investing in additional properties and conducting share repurchases.Following PrairieSky Royalty's bi-annual investor day, TD Securities downgraded PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF) stock from Buy to Hold on May 18. The downgrade comes with a price target of C$24. TD Securities recognizes the advantages of the royalty model compared to other business types but attributed the downgrade to the stock's strong performance so far this year and its current valuation.In addition to Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), The Howard Hughes Corporation (NYSE:HHC), and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. (OTC:PREKF) is one of the best land and timber stocks to watch. 11. Acadian Timber Corp. (OTC:ACAZF)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/AAcadian Timber Corp. (OTC:ACAZF) provides primary forest products in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States. The company is divided into two segments, namely NB Timberlands and Maine Timberlands. Acadian Timber Corp. offers a variety of products including softwood and hardwood sawlogs, pulpwood, and biomass by-products. Acadian Timber Corp. (OTC:ACAZF), which focuses on generating income, possesses approximately 1.1 million acres of timberland in Maine and New Brunswick. Additionally, the company manages an additional 1.3 million acres of Canadian Crown Lands. With a minimal salary expense, Acadian Timber likely employs a small workforce of around a dozen employees or so. The company stands out as an exception to the growth constraints typically associated with real estate investment trusts. It is one of the premier land and timber stocks to invest in.On May 4, Acadian Timber Corp. (OTC:ACAZF) reported Q1 GAAP earnings per share of C$0.22 and a revenue of C$22.36 million, topping Wall Street consensus by C$2.55 million. CIBC analyst Hamir Patel on January 10 maintained a Neutral rating on Acadian Timber Corp. (OTC:ACAZF) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to C$16 from C$17. 10. Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 9Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in acquiring and owning farmland and farm-related properties situated in key agricultural markets across the United States. Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND) leases these properties to third-party farmers. In addition to general farmland, the company also owns farms that cultivate permanent crops like almonds, apples, cherries, figs, lemons, olives, blueberries, and pistachios. Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND) has a vast ownership of over 115,000 acres of farmland, spread across 169 farms in 15 states. However, it faces certain growth limitations as a real estate investment trust. On the positive side, leasing farmland comes with the advantage of no operational expenses for Gladstone. The responsibility for capital expenditures, such as farm equipment, lies with the farmers who lease the land. As the property owner, Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND) primarily provides the land and collects rent. In the event of rising prices of agricultural products, particularly during an inflationary cycle, the farmland's value is expected to increase inherently. It is one of the best land and timber stocks to buy. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 9 hedge funds were long Gladstone Land Corporation (NASDAQ:LAND), compared to 7 funds in the preceding quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 265,900 shares worth $4.4 million. 9. Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC) is involved in real estate development and agribusiness. The company, along with its subsidiaries, operates through five distinct segments – Commercial/Industrial Real Estate Development, Resort/Residential Real Estate Development, Mineral Resources, Farming, and Ranch Operations. It is one of the top land and timber stocks to buy. The value of the land owned by Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC) is primarily derived from its strategic location. Los Angeles serves as the largest port city in the United States and is a significant hub for e-commerce shipments. However, the city's high rents, property prices, congestion, and regulations pose challenges for the expansion and development of warehouse and logistics facilities. Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC) has capitalized on this situation by successfully developing over 8 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and retail space, including distribution centers, in close proximity to Los Angeles. Notable tenants leasing from Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC) include companies such as Ikea, Dollar General, and Caterpillar. Interestingly, Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC) itself occupies a land area that is approximately the same size as Los Angeles.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 10 hedge funds were bullish on Tejon Ranch Co. (NYSE:TRC), compared to 9 funds in the preceding quarter. Murray Stahl’s Horizon Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $21 million. 8. Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) is a prominent real estate investment trust focused on timberland, possessing valuable assets situated in highly productive areas for softwood timber growth within the United States and New Zealand. The trust generates revenue through fees charged to logging operators. It possesses a vast land portfolio spanning 2.8 million acres across 11 states in the US and New Zealand. It is one of the best land and timber stocks to watch. On May 19, Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 30, to shareholders of record on June 16. Michael Roxland, an analyst at Truist, initiated coverage on Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) on May 15 by assigning it a Hold rating and a price target of $33. Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) stands out among the three publicly traded timber real estate investment trusts (REITs) because it exclusively focuses on timber and does not have any supplementary businesses like wood products. The analyst informed investors that the Hold rating is influenced by factors such as decreased demand for wood and timber, rising interest rates, concerns about profitability in the Pacific Northwest, and apprehension about an oversupply of sawtimber in the southern region of the United States.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 14 hedge funds were long Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN), compared to 16 funds in the earlier quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company. Here is what Third Avenue Management has to say about Rayonier Inc. (NYSE:RYN) in their Q3 2020 investor letter:“Third Avenue has long championed enterprises with sound business practices run by aligned control groups that exhibit strong stewardship. Within Third Avenue’s real estate strategy, this oftentimes leads the Fund to “pass” on investments in companies with uncertain environmental liabilities, business models that could be deemed predatory, and corporate governance structures that are stacked against key stakeholders. Consequently, the select-set of real estate and real estate-related business that make it into the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund represent some of the true industry leaders in respect to their ESG practices, including Rayonier, that own more than ‘2.7 million’ acres of timberlands and sequester more carbon than any other privately-held enterprises globally (to our knowledge) — an underappreciated attribute that may ultimately have incremental value through a carbon-credit initiative or even strategic value for larger enterprises seeking to offset emissions.”7. PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) possesses a land portfolio of 2.2 million acres distributed across Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. As a manufacturer of wood products, the company employs 1,300 individuals. In addition to its primary operations, PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) operates several facilities through its taxable real estate investment trust (REIT) subsidiary, including six sawmills, an industrial-grade plywood mill, a business focused on residential and commercial real estate development, and a program for the sale of rural timberland. The company also has a leadership role in sustainable forest management. On May 5, PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on June 30 to shareholders of record on June 2.Kurt Yinger, an analyst at DA Davidson, maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $55 on PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) shares on April 25, following the company's better-than-expected Q1 earnings. According to the analyst's research note, the company achieved these results by capitalizing on favorable logging conditions and achieving record harvest levels. Although the profitability of the Wood Products segment faced challenges, the firm suggests that it will still remain competitive, and possibly even favorable, compared to industry peers who are yet to release their earnings reports.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 16 hedge funds were bullish on PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH), with collective stakes worth $217.4 million. Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.14 million shares worth $155.7 million. ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy made the following comment about PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also seized the opportunity to add PotlatchDeltic Corporation (NASDAQ:PCH), in the real estate sector. The company owns 1.8 million acres of timberland in the U.S. as well as six sawmills, an industrial-grade plywood mill and a rural timberland sales program. The stock has been weak since lumber prices peaked in 2022, creating an exceptionally compelling entry point far below the value of its net assets. We believe the company will be able to successfully navigate through a potential downturn in construction without meaningful impairment of its assets based on its strong balance sheet. Additionally, as PotlatchDeltic’s inventory of trees will increase in value over time, the company will benefit from delaying its harvesting activity until the market rebounds to a more attractive level.”6. West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG) is a diverse wood products company involved in the manufacturing, selling, marketing, and distribution of wood-based products. These include lumber, engineered wood products, pulp, newsprint, wood chips, and other residuals and renewable energy sources. It is one of the best land and timber stocks to buy. West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG)’s Q1 2023 revenue of $1.63 billion outperformed Wall Street estimates by $200 million. On April 20, CIBC analyst Hamir Patel maintained an Outperform rating on West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to C$126 from C$129. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 16 hedge funds were bullish on West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG), compared to 15 funds in the last quarter. Murray Stahl’s Horizon Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 454,723 shares worth $32.4 million. Like Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL), The Howard Hughes Corporation (NYSE:HHC), and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG) is one of the best land and timber stocks to invest in.

The episode then dives into three large-cap technology stocks—Intuit Inc. (INTU), Garmin (GRMN), and Paycom Software (PAYC)—with strong histories of outperformance over the last roughly 10 years and solid growth outlooks that are still trading at least 40% below their record highs.After weeks of back and forth and constant headlines about the debt ceiling and the possibility of default, the powers that be in Washington finally passed a deal. Now Wall Street can get back to focusing on the economy, earnings, inflation, and interest rates.Despite the hot May jobs report on Friday, stocks climbed and Wall Street is rather convinced that the Fed will pause in June. The S&amp;P 500 is now up over 11% in 2023, with Nvidia and a handful of other mega-cap giants driving a large portion of those gains.The big winners have somewhat hidden the fact that many large-cap technology stocks have yet to truly participate in the rally. Investors who can stomach some near-term uncertainty might be well-served to start buying some of these beaten-down tech names at levels that might very well prove to be big discounts months or years down the line.Intuit (INTU) spent the covid boom beefing up its portfolio beyond TurboTax and other financial services software to include email marketing, digital-ad services, CRM tools, credit scores, and other personal financial services. INTU now owns Credit Karma and Mailchimp and it is poised to extend its streak of double-digital revenue growth to nine years running, based on our FY23 and FY24 estimates.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit is projected to post 19% adjusted earnings growth in FY23 and 10% higher EPS in FY24. The company also pays a dividend, and 19 of the 21 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for INTU are “Strong Buys.” Story continuesDespite its expanded portfolio of key software offerings, Intuit trades nearly 40% below its peaks. INTU might also be ready to finally break out of the trading range it has been stuck in for most of the last year. And it’s worth stressing that INTU shares are still up 625% over the last 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 260%.Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) is best known for its consumer-centric GPS systems that range from in-car navigation to fitness wearables and smartwatches. On top of Garmin’s everyday consumer electronics, it sells high-end fish finders, advanced radars and systems for boats and airplanes, and beyond. Garmin’s revenue and earnings slipped in 2022 as they came up against a tough stretch of growth, including 19% sales expansion in FY21.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGarmin beat our Q1 FY23 earnings and revenue estimates in early May and it provided upbeat guidance to help GRMN land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Garmin is projected to return to sales and EPS growth in 2023 and then jump even higher next year. Garmin has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 in the last 10 years yet it currently trades 40% below its 2021 records. Garmin’s valuation levels are rather enticing and it is trading well above its 50-day moving average, following its post-release spike. And GRMN’s dividend yields 2.8% right now.  Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC) was one of the first web-based HR and payroll technology companies. Paycom has been expanding its offerings for over 20 years to help companies, HR departments, and employees via streamlined and user-friendly offerings for payroll, hiring, and beyond. Paycom’s software often becomes embedded and essential at companies big and small, and its decade of impressive double-digit revenue growth backs up its value and critical nature.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaycom surpassed our Q1 earnings and revenue estimates in early May and it announced that it would start paying a dividend. PAYC’s decision to start paying a dividend appears even more beneficial to shareholders considering that it is still projected to post 25% revenue and earnings growth this year and 21% higher sales and EPS in 2024. Paycom stock has skyrocketed since its 2014 IPO. But PAYC is now down over the last three years to trade nearly 50% beneath its record highs. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 6.4% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 18% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Valero Energy, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. View our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Valero Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Valero Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Valero Energy. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.8%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Valero Energy Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$178m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Valero Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Valero Energy is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

In fact, there are only 5 companies on that list currently. Investors can buy shares in 4 of the 5 on U.S. exchanges. The fifth, Saudi Aramco, trades on the Tadawul, Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange. Regardless of where they can be purchased, companies valued at $1 trillion make up a tiny fraction of all firms on the planet, and investors are always looking for the next trillion-dollar companies.It’s a safe bet that the next trillion-dollar firm already ranks fairly highly by market capitalization. Companies of this magnitude don’t emerge overnight. The firms below have strong chances of joining the short list of trillion-dollar club stocks, perhaps as the next entrant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is highly likely to be the next high-growth stock for the trillion-dollar club. It is currently ranked 6th by market cap at $963 billion, roughly $300 billion behind entry number 5, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), valued at $1.2 trillion. That said, Nvidia still has a long way to go to reach the trillion dollar threshold. Yet, it is the most likely to join the club. Not only because of all the firms below that milestone it is the closest, but also because of artificial intelligence (AI). The emergence of AI has again catalyzed Nvidia into another period of rapid growth. In 2023 alone Nvidia’s value has increased more than 160%. This could be the fifth year since 2016 that the company has seen its value increase by 100% or more if current trends continue for the year. The company seems to move by trends more than fundamentals. If 2023’s AI boom continues and markets continue to favor the tech then NVDA shares could reach that threshold quickly. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) stock is a safe bet to cross the $1 trillion threshold at some point. That said, UNH is valued at $448 billion right now. Meaning it’s likely going to take a while before it could reasonably be expected to more than double in value. Story continuesApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was worth $500 billion in 2012. Apple broke the $1 trillion mark in August 2018. That probably means UNH stock will take longer given that the healthcare sector doesn’t grow nearly as quickly as valuations do in the tech sector. But it at least gives investors some idea of what to expect in regard to the growth trajectory. What’s more important here is that UnitedHealth will grow steadily to one day reach $1 trillion. Shareholders should expect roughly $25 in earnings for each UNH share they own in 2023. Add to that, its dividend, and UnitedHealth is one of the steadiest companies that will one day reach that valuation. Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is the 15th most valuable firm globally, worth $405 billion. Like UnitedHealth Group, it’s a long way from $1 trillion. However, Eli Lilly has a potent catalyst on its side in the form of Mounjaro, its diabetes drug that is showing massive promise as a weight loss therapy. It could receive an FDA recommendation as a weight loss drug by the end of this year. If it does, expect share prices to rise. Over time the appetite suppressant has the possibility to become among the best-selling drugs ever.Analysts believe Mounjaro could reach peak sales of $25 billion. That would be far above the $20.7 billion Humira recorded in 2022, a record aside from Covid-19 vaccines. Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s drug, Donanemab, continues to show promising results and is considered to be among the best candidates for treating that disease. A win there would only hasten LLY’s march to $1 trillion. That said, analysts believe that even without an Alzheimer’s breakthrough Eli Lilly will only continue to increase in value. $1 trillion is far away now but breakthrough pharma sales will act as a powerful valuation catalyst. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have lost about 9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Estee Lauder due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.The Estee Lauder Companies Cuts View on Q3 Earnings MissThe Estee Lauder Companies reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year. Net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while earnings missed the same.Results were affected by increased inflation, concerns surrounding the recession and unfavorable currency rates. The company has been witnessing greater volatility in the recovery from the pandemic across Asia travel retail. Management is lowering its organic sales and EPS outlook for fiscal 2023.Quarter in DetailThe company posted adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents but surpassed our estimate of 43 cents. The bottom line slumped 75% (down 74% at constant currency or cc) year over year. This includes an adverse currency impact of 3% on core international travel retail locations.Net sales of $3,751 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,716.3 million and our estimate of $3,704.6 million. The metric declined 12% from $4,245 million reported in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the impact of license terminations associated with certain designer fragrances and unfavorable currency rates. Organic net sales declined 8%, mainly owing to declines in Asia travel retail in Hainan and Korea. That said, organic net sales grew in almost all markets, which includes developed markets of the United States, the U.K. and Hong Kong and emerging markets worldwide.The gross profit came in at $2,592 million, down 20% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 69.1% from 76.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. In constant currency or cc, adjusted operating income slumped 65%, mainly due to reduced net sales and increased cost of sales.Story continuesProduct-Based Segment ResultsSkin Care’s sales were down 20% year over year to $1,922 million. Makeup revenues fell 2% year over year to $1,088 million. In the Fragrance category, revenues were up 1% year over year at $585 million. Hair Care sales totaled $149 million, up 1%.Regional ResultsSales in the Americas moved up 3% year over year to $1,089 million. Revenues in the EMEA region declined 26% to $1,474 million. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales dropped 1% to $1,192 million.Other UpdatesThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5,531 million, long-term debt of $5,128 million and total equity of $5,877 million. Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2023, was $1,017 million. The company returned $0.95 billion in cash to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases during the quarter.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, The Estee Lauder Companies witnessed continued post-COVID recovery growth with solid organic net sales performance in The Americas and markets across Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa, excluding travel retail. While it experienced recovery in many markets worldwide, its Asia travel retail business continued to be under pressure by the slower-than-expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. The shipments to duty free retailers were under pressure in Korea due to the transition to post-COVID regulations.GuidanceFor fiscal 2023, management projects net sales to decline in the band of 10-12% year over year, including an unfavorable currency impact. The view includes slower-than-anticipated return to growth across Asia travel retail and the termination of certain license agreements. Organic net sales growth is now anticipated to decline 5-7%, including currency headwinds. Adjusted EPS are expected in the band of $3.29-$3.39, suggesting a 53-55% decline from the year-ago period’s levels. The bottom line is expected to decline 50-51% at cc.Management anticipates organic net sales to return to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, with continued momentum of post-COVID recovery growth in almost every market. However, the adverse impact from the persistent pressures across Asia travel retail is a headwind.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -101.81% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Estee Lauder has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 31%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 0.8%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 9.1% in three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 28% in the last 90 days.After losing 4.3% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, Estée Lauder Companies had to report a 67% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price fall of 31% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster. Indeed, with a P/E ratio of 59.92 there is obviously some real optimism that earnings will bounce back.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Estée Lauder Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 0.8% in the last year, Estée Lauder Companies shareholders lost 30% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Estée Lauder Companies  that you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

A rush of government stimulus combined with a strong economy gave Americans a ton of disposable cash for shopping. However, amid surging inflation and fears of an impending economic slowdown, consumers are tightening their belts in 2023. That has pushed certain household name stocks into negative territory for the year.When investing in household name stocks, it’s important to ask whether the company in question is seeing its market position weaken, or if it is merely passing through a temporary downturn. For those merely facing transitory issues, it can be a great time to buy these stocks on the dip.Consumer companies are facing significant challenges now. Supply chains, inflation, and slowing demand are all impacting earnings. But these won’t be permanent issues, and companies with strong brands will brush off this momentary weakness. In my view, these are the three best household name stocks to buy on dip today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNKENike$107.51KOCoca-Cola$60.26ELEstee Lauder$194.44Nike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comShares of global footwear and athletic apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) are on a losing streak. NKE stock is down more than 10% over the past month, and Nike has fallen to its year-to-date lows for 2023, at the time of writing.Much of this selloff has been tied to a dismal earnings report from retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) last week. Foot Locker shares plunged 25% amid weak earnings and sour guidance for the rest of 2023. Investors are interpreting this to mean that sales for Nike and other footwear makers will also fall.That theory isn’t entirely unfounded. However, it misses the big point around Nike’s strategy over the past five years. Nike has invested in industry-leading direct-to-consumer e-commerce solutions. Nike has been wanting to reduce the importance of third-party stores like Foot Locker for many years, allowing Nike to earn a higher profit margin on its sales.Story continuesThere is a world where Nike can produce solid results even as Foot Locker struggles. Now, to be fair, Nike may have some issues of its own. Williams Trading, for example, cut NKE stock to a sell rating on Monday, warning of a stale product mix.That said, there’s little doubt that Nike will remain a global growth story over the longer-term. And with some key markets such as China picking up steam, Nike should find itself back on track soon.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comShares of beverage leader Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) have slipped in recent weeks and are now down slightly year-to-date. This represents a buying opportunity for this venerable growth and income stock.Coca-Cola is the ultimate consumer favorite, with its namesake beverage being found in nearly all corners of the globe.Coca-Cola has had an interesting couple of years. The pandemic resulted in a stark hit to sales at stadiums, restaurants, movie theaters and other such public venues. And then supply chain and inflationary issues dinged profit margins once the economy started to reopen.Now, though, things should normalize for Coca-Cola. Supply chains and input costs are stabilizing. And with the global economy returning to a more standard state, Coca-Cola should see its operations fare well in the months and years to come. With the recent dip, shares are now at 24-times forward earnings and offer a 3% dividend yield.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is one of the most dominant players in the cosmetics industry. There were initial concerns over how the industry would fare during the pandemic era, when people were stuck at home. However, as the economy reopened, cosmetics saw a surge in activity and EL stock soared to new all-time highs.However, the pandemic reopening pop has ended. EL stock is now down more than 20% year-to-date following a weaker-than-expected earnings report.This is a buying opportunity. Estee Lauder has averaged 11% annualized free cash flow growth and 12% earnings per share growth over the past decade.Additionally, the company has also managed to produce tremendous 79% gross margins over the past decade. With something as important to consumers as their cosmetics, price isn’t an obstacle. Estee Lauder has a fantastic group of brands, and shares should recover in coming months.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in NKE and EL stock.

Dividend growers become top choices for investors, especially during bearish markets, because of their ability to generate stable cash flows and return profits to shareholders. When the market was down from December 1999 to March 2022, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by an average of 140 basis points per month, according to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Dividend growth is one of the most important aspects of dividend investing.

KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”12.

To explore similar stocks, you can take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Are Climbing In This Market.""The Winners Make No Sense""On May 9, CNBC's Mad Money host, Jim Cramer, dived into the current market dynamics to try and unravel the perplexing trends and developments we've been seeing unfold in the market so far in 2023. While bears have been whispering that a ""financial storm"" has been brewing and has ""snuck up on us,"" with a debt ceiling crisis and economic recession on the horizon, Cramer notes that the market still has not ""cratered."" Everyone seems to be confused about how the market has been ""hanging in there."" To deal with this confusion, Cramer went through several financial chart to try and spot what the ""strategists might be missing."" The answer he came to was that the stocks and sectors that have been rising seem to ""make no sense."" In fact, ""they aren't supposed to be on top all at once"" at all.Noting this perplexing phenomenon, Cramer then begins to go over various sectors and companies that had been performing well in May. While they included big-tech names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) alongside major drug companies such as Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), they also included industrials, housing, travel and leisure, and consumer packaged goods companies. With such a wide range of positively-performing sectors, especially those that are generally not up all together at the same time, Cramer began to break down what has been setting each sector apart in 2023, leading to its success.Cramer's Thoughts on Industrials and Housing StocksIn answering the question behind the success of industrials stocks even after the Fed has raised ""rates by 500 basis points in 14 months,"" Cramer noted that most leaders in this industry ""are involved in aerospace, or decarbonization, or both. He explained that the aerospace industry, being cyclical in nature and hosting ""so much pent up demand,"" is one of the key factors driving the growth being several industrials stocks. These include companies that are suppliers for ""Boeing or Air Bus, like General Electric.""Story continuesMoving on from industrials, Cramer delves deep into the housing industry and notes that historically, housing stocks ""should be at their 52-week-lows, not highs"" because ""when the Fed raises rates aggressively, these stocks are supposed to get hammered."" However, considering the ""tremendous housing shortage"" in the US, this industry has actually been incredibly successful so far in 2023. Homebuilders have also apparently ""raised prices by a gigantic amount, roughly 25% on average over the past two years."" According to Cramer, this trend has become pronounced in the housing industry because the rising demand for housing in the US has reduced the need for housing companies to offer lower prices to their customers.""Healthcare Is Running""Another industry whose success Cramer sees as an anomaly is the healthcare industry. Cramer noted that stocks operating in this sector are usually ""classic slow-down stocks that shouldn't be running at the same time as the industrials and the housing stocks,"" but this doesn't seem to be the case this year. The reason behind this development seems to be the ""new product cycles"" many drug companies are enjoying in 2023. There's also the ""emerging turn in medical devices"" as the pandemic has died down. According to Cramer, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals ""deferred non-urgent surgeries,"" so now, with the pandemic out of the way, demand for these surgeries and the devices required for them has ""come back with a vengeance.""""Pent-up demand"" is also the key factor behind the surprising success of travel and leisure stocks, according to Cramer. He noted that ""we're in a weird post-pandemic moment where everybody feels long on money and short on time."" This sense of urgency that many people in the US may feel best explains the perplexing case of the travel and leisure industry, which ""should be faltering at this stage"" but isn't.In short, Cramer helped explain the confusing market reality on his show by holding up a microscope to the performance of the companies in these industries. Considering these factors, we decided to cover the top stocks out of the ones Cramer mentioned on Mad Money.Our MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we watched Jim Cramer's Mad Money episode from May 9, when the host gave a rundown on what stocks and sectors have been climbing the market so far in 2023. Cramer went through a range of names, including industrial companies, housing corporations, drug companies, consumer packaged goods stocks, and big tech.

While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro. Moreover, investors became skeptical of potential regulatory scrutiny around Donanemab and its efficacy relative to Biogen’s competing offering.”Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a stock that has performed well in the current market conditions.8.

That sector has since rebounded, lifting ADI with it. We believe ADI is a well-run company and a secular grower, which should augur well for its future.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Dividend stocks are garnering investors’ attention in 2023 as the stock market recovers from its bear market lows seen last year. There are several studies showing the effectiveness of dividend investing. For example, Heartland Advisors conducted one such research which showed that from 1802 to 2002, dividends represented 5.8% of the full 7.9% total annualized return of the stock market, including dividend growth. The study also cited London Business School’s research, which showed that the average real return across 17 countries from 1900 to 2005 stood at 5%, while the average dividend yield of those countries came in at 4.5% during this period.Dividend investing may seem a simple strategy on the surface, but there are many dimensions to consider in order to generate regular income through these stocks. Reinvesting dividends is one of the most popular ways to accelerate income through the power of compounding. Since 1960, reinvested dividends accounted for 69% of the S&amp;P 500’s total returns, as we reported in our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know. We further mentioned data in the article which showed that the broad market’s annual average return over the past 50 years came in at 7.58%, which grew to 10.51% by reinvesting dividends. Additionally, dividends can contribute to investors’ overall performance and reduce volatility because of their defensive nature. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, spoke to CNBC last year about the importance of dividend stocks. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Essentially, dividends can improve your performance by a third without doing anything. You can add octane to your performance just by owning dividend-paying stocks.”Story continuesThis is to be noted that last year was one of the best years for dividend stocks as they outperformed the market by a wide margin. Moreover, companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid a record amount to shareholders in dividends.While dividend payment frequencies can vary among different companies, some of them choose to distribute dividends on an annual basis. The decision to pay annual dividends may be influenced by the respective company’s financial stability, profitability, and cash flow. In addition to this, businesses in certain industries or stages of growth may opt for annual dividends to provide a substantial return to shareholders while retaining more capital for reinvestment. While major companies such as The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) pay dividends on a quarterly basis, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks that offer annual dividends.14 Best Annual Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by nick chong on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend companies that pay dividends just once a year to shareholders.

264,cf1ed331-0a2e-354a-a195-fad880d10f71,SLG,2023-06-03,Why Is Outfront Media (OUT) Down 6.5% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-outfront-media-down-6-153148384.html,1685719908.0,STORY,"['OUT', 'SLG']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Outfront Media (OUT). Shares have lost about 6.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Outfront Media due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.OUTFRONT Media Misses Q1 AFFO Mark on Higher ExpensesOUTFRONT Media reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share of 5 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents. The figure was also lower than the prior-year quarter’s tally of 23 cents.Results reflected higher operating expenses and interest expenses in the quarter.Nonetheless, quarterly revenues of $395.8 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $383.8 million and climbed nearly 6% year over year. Higher billboard revenues contributed to this rise.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, billboard revenues were $320.6 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The upside resulted mainly from the impact of new and lost billboards in the period, inclusive of acquisitions, higher proceeds from condemnations, and a rise in average revenues per display (referred to as yield).The company’s transit and other revenues of $75.2 million decreased marginally from the year-ago quarter. This was primarily due to a fall in yield arising from weaker market conditions in national advertising and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partly offset by the impact of a new transit franchise contract.OUTFRONT Media’s operating income totaled $10.2 million in the first quarter, plunging 64.2% from the year-ago quarter’s $28.5 million.Operating expenses were $235.5 million, which increased 10.7% year over year. The rise was mostly due to an out-of-period adjustment of $5.2 million recorded in the first quarter, related to variable billboard property lease expenses and costs associated with higher billboard revenues. Also, greater guaranteed minimum annual payments to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority were a contributing factor.Net interest expenses of $37.7 million increased from $30.7 million in the prior-year period, mainly due to higher interest rates than the year-ago quarter and a greater average debt balance.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Lennar (LEN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.38 a share, just 18 days from its upcoming earnings release on June 20, 2023.Lennar's Earnings ESP sits at 3.65%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.38 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.30.LEN is just one of a large group of Construction stocks with a positive ESP figure. D.R. Horton (DHI) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.D.R. Horton is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 20, 2023. DHI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.82 a share 48 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for D.R. Horton is $2.80, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.6%.Story continuesLEN and DHI's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Due to many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities ensures necessary investments in infrastructure upgrades and the continuation of high-quality customer service. American Water Works is the largest and most geographically diverse publicly traded water and wastewater utility company that continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Essential Investments for Water SpacePer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.American Water Works is making regular investments to maintain its infrastructure. It aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for the 10 years of 2023-2032.Other water utilities like Essential Utilities WTRG, California Water Service Group CWT and Middlesex Water MSEX have well-chalked-out capital investment plans to strengthen their infrastructure.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion in 2023 and $3.3 billion through 2025 to improve water and natural gas systems and better serve customers using improved information technology.California Water Service plans to invest more than $725 million in capital expenditures through 2024.Middlesex Water plans to invest $266 million during 2023-2025 to strengthen its water and wastewater infrastructure and provide services to customers in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.Investments from the investor-owned utilities are not enough to meet the huge requirement, so the government is also assisting in upgrading aging water and wastewater infrastructure.

273,bc250e47-d911-328b-94ae-f7a9500dfd14,FCX,2023-06-03,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-fcx-attracting-130007695.html,1685710807,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 7.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.09 points to a change of -14.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.43 indicates a change of +16.5% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $23.92 billion and $24.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +0.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see the top poorest countries in this region, check out 5 Poorest Countries in Europe.As per Eurostat’s findings, approximately 21.7% of the population in the European Union (EU), amounting to about 95.4 million people, faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2021. The findings showed that women, young adults, individuals with limited educational qualifications, and, more specifically, unemployed people were at a greater risk of poverty or social exclusion. In the European Union, although the probability of employed people facing poverty or social exclusion stood at 11.1%, and that of retired persons was 18.6%, for unemployed and other idle individuals, the risk of poverty or social exclusion stood at 64.5% and 42.3%, respectively. Among the nations within the EU, Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece exhibited the highest percentages of individuals identified as facing the risk of poverty. Eurostat reported that families with dependent children were more likely to face the threat of poverty or social exclusion at 22.5%, compared to families without dependents at 20.9%.According to Euronews, compared to the general population, there is a greater risk of young Europeans falling victim to poverty. In 2021, data indicated that 20% of individuals in the age group of 15 to 29 faced a risk of poverty. Moreover, the overall at-risk-of-poverty rate for the entire population of the EU was recorded at 17%. In terms of the disparity between at-risk young individuals and the general population, Denmark exhibited the most significant divide, with 25.6% of young people facing risks compared to 12.3% of the overall population. Sweden followed closely behind Denmark, with a margin of nearly nine percentage points. Eurostat explained this indicator in the following words:“It doesn't necessarily imply a low standard of living, and measures the share of people that have disposable income below the poverty threshold.”Story continuesA World Economic Forum report noted that approximately 7% of the population in the European Union faced difficulties in maintaining adequate heating in their homes during the year 2021. This was because Europe faced an energy shortage which resulted in an increase in heating bills. Fuel poverty had the most impact on Bulgaria, with Lithuania and Cyprus closely trailing behind. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, one in three individuals faced the risk of encountering energy poverty during the winter season.Moreover, Save the Children reported that in 2021, the European Union nations saw an increase of over 200,000 in the number of children on the verge of poverty, pushing the overall number of children likely to face poverty to more than 19.6 million. Factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, high cost of living, and the climate crisis caused the number of families and children facing poverty to escalate at an unnerving pace. According to the AROPE (At Risk of Poverty and/or Exclusion) indicator, Spain and Romania emerged as the nations with the most elevated proportions, 33.4% and 41.5% respectively, of children at risk of experiencing poverty or social exclusion. During 2022, Romania witnessed a remarkable surge of 98% in expenses. However, 40% of households faced a decline in income, compelling them to adopt substantial cost-cutting measures. The report highlighted that the most vulnerable children in this situation were asylum-seekers, those with migrant backgrounds, and undocumented children.Ylva Sperling, Save the Children Europe Director, stated:“No child should have to go to school on an empty stomach, worry about their parent’s job or live in a household that’s cold. Yet, the impact of Europe’s many crises makes eating or heating no longer a choice for many families and deprives children of the essentials they need for their development and well-being.”According to the European Central Bank, the Russia-Ukraine war devastated the worldwide economy. The conflict affected the food and energy markets in particular, causing a decrease in supply and an unusual increase in prices. The EU has been particularly vulnerable to the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared to other regions. The United Nations’ “World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023” report estimated the huge losses endured by the economy of Ukraine, noting that the country’s economy experienced a decrease of over 30% in 2022.In October 2022, the New York Times observed that after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, various global companies, like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) were left facing the difficulty of unraveling complex agreements in Russia. These companies had established relationships with the country over several decades, making the situation particularly complex. Upon being pressurized by consumers and investors, multiple Western companies decided to fully exit Russia. Adidas, for example, decided to discontinue sales in the country, despite having nearly 500 stores in Russia and the previous Soviet states. This also contributed to the issue of poverty in Europe and may have long-term implications as well. In this article, we discuss the poorest European nations.Poorest Countries in EuropePhoto by Ev on Unsplash Our MethodologyTo identify the poorest countries in Europe, we examined data from Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Databook 2022, specifically focusing on the GDP per Adult in 2021. GDP per adult helps identify countries with lower average income levels, indicating that individuals in those countries may have limited financial resources. We selected the 20 poorest countries in Europe based on this metric, ranking the list in descending order of GDP per adult. It is important to acknowledge that some of these countries may appear relatively prosperous because Europe is generally a wealthy continent.Nevertheless, poverty encompasses a wide range of factors, including the availability of essential needs such as food, clean water, healthcare, education, housing, and social services. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of poverty in a country, it is vital to consider multiple indicators and measures. These aspects cannot be fully captured by GDP per capita alone.Poorest Countries in Europe20. LithuaniaGDP per Adult in 2021: $29,276Lithuania, recognized as the Republic of Lithuania, is a nation located in the Baltic region of Europe. The capital and largest city of Lithuania is Vilnius.

DGX is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by stronger base volume trends and growth from acquisitions. In the first quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ earnings and revenues were well ahead of estimates. However, COVID-19 testing revenues and a contraction of margins are concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 1.5% compared with the industry’s 17.7% fall and a 2.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $14.86 billion. Quest Diagnostics has an earnings yield of 6.58% compared with the industry’s yield of 3.89%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 5.24%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsBase Volume Improves: During the reported quarter, DGX’s base business revenues were up 10%, supported by base business volume growth of nearly 8%. Strong volume growth across all customer types is encouraging. This suggests that people are returning to the healthcare system for routine care after delaying the same during the pandemic. The growth trend in health plan volumes is faster than the overall business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWithin health plans, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts. Quest Diagnostics started benefiting from incentives related to these value-based contracts, which help demonstrate the value of strategic relationships.Accelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: On Apr 27, the company announced its planned acquisition of Haystack Oncology — an early-stage oncology company, focused on minimal residual disease or minimal residual disease (MRD) testing. The combined strengths of Haystack liquid biopsy technology and DGX’s screening, pathology and sequencing will enable the latter to play a leading role in the fast-growing MRD category.Further, the company recently completed its strategic laboratory services acquisition with NewYork-Presbyterian. New test volumes started to flow into the company’s New Jersey laboratory earlier this month.  Within advanced diagnostics, the brain health area expanded, banking on Quest AD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test.Story continuesQ1 Highlights: In the first quarter, Quest Diagnostics’ earnings and revenues were better than expected. The base business was driven by the strong performance across physician and health system lab services. The company’s ongoing efforts to partner with health plans in actively steering patients to high-quality, lower-cost providers have resulted in volume growth.Quest Diagnostics had several big wins in the reference business during the quarter. The company extended its professional lab services to Pennsylvania-based Tower Health to manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing.DownsidesLower COVID-19 Testing Revenues: COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80%in the first quarter. The company completed nearly 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter compared with five million tests in the prior-year quarter.Mounting Expenses Strain Margins: Despite a year-over-year decrease in the cost of services, the gross margin contracted 388 basis points (bps) in the first quarter. SG&amp;A expenses rose, causing a 644-bps contraction in the adjusted operating margin.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved from $8.75 to $8.73 in the past 30 days.The consensus estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.01 billion.

This situation was particularly true in communities without reliable access to the internet or technologies to aid teachers and families with remote instruction. More is needed to help this population of learners accelerate learning to meet minimum learning proficiency levels country by country. And more needs to be done to inclusively connect these communities and their students to trained teachers and quality classroom resources.World Possible is a Cisco nonprofit partner who bridges these gaps and connects offline learners to the world's knowledge with an educational server called RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning). RACHEL is an innovative learning tool for teachers to engage their students and bridge the digital divide and help scale teacher productivity while working with diverse classrooms.In appreciation of educators everywhere, we want to shine a light on World Possible technology being used by teachers and students in Oceania, Asia and Latin America. In these examples, RACHEL is used to build teacher capacity, increase student engagement, and improve overall classroom performance while helping students living in remote and disconnected communities build digital skills.Oceania - Kiribati:Kiribati is an island country composed of over 30 atolls with over 17,500 students attending 110 schools. These students and their teachers are spread over 3.5 million square kilometers in the central Pacific Ocean. With such a dispersed and distributed population, education officials address the challenge of providing access to trained teachers with current curriculum in programs like the Kiribati Education Improvement Program.Story continuesKiribati Education officials use RACHEL server devices to store digital media within key training schools. These servers have the flexibility to be solar powered with battery backup support to reach even the most remote areas of this island country. With the high cost of internet, which is primarily only available through mobile phone data plans, access to these resources at scale isn't sustainable for these communities. But a RACHEL content device changes this dynamic, making professional training and receiving updated content easier.Asia - Cambodia:The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies and is committed to connecting all the world's people. Through their work, ITU Data Hub reports indicate that 60% of individuals in Cambodia are using the internet compared with the world average of 66%. This gap in access to the internet within Cambodia increases in rural and remote populations. World Possible serves as a bridge for this digital divide for teachers and students in rural Cambodia.At Doris Dillon School, the World Possible RACHEL server is used directly by students in classrooms to learn English, improve numeracy skills and build digital skills using computers. The RACHEL device also acts as a community digital library, used by families for gardening, health education and computer classes.Latin America - GuatemalaWithin Latin America, access to the internet and technology for use in schools can be challenging. In Guatemala, the same ITU Data Hub reports indicate that 51% of individuals in the country are using the internet compared with the world average of 66%. With a beautiful and rugged landscape, Guatemala has high mountain ranges dotted with volcanos, jungle regions and large urban cities such as Guatemala City or Quetzaltenango in the northern highlands. Within this diverse geography is a school using RACHEL located in Sacsiguán Monte Mercedes, a small village from Sololá, in the western highlands of Guatemala. In this remote and rural area, Elvia Patricia Julajuj Cuxulic, who is an accountant by profession, teaches in the Monte Mercedes Secondary School leads seven classes of students every week in the afternoons serving 87 students from grades 7 to 9.Earlier this year her school received a RACHEL server that is now being used by students who previously had little access to the internet. As a teacher, Elvia has been actively using the device with her students and reports to the Ministry of Education show over 130,000 logged events, and 66,900 pages visited. As one of four teachers in Monte Mercedes Secondary School, she hopes that her students and her community will all have the chance of having a better life through education.More to comeCisco inclusively invests using a portfolio approach in nonprofits to further STEM Education student outcomes, inspire youth to regenerate our climate and develop trained teacher capacity globally. Through investment partners like World Possible we aim to strengthen human capital, inclusively connect people to resources and services with quality platforms informed by education proven practice.This fall, World Possible will release an upgraded RACHEL server with increased capacity for concurrent device connections, improved device storage, and will leverage a new processor.
