The underwriting loss was the largest the industry has seen since 2011.Net income fell to $41.2 billion in 2022, compared to $62.1 billion a year earlier – a 33.6% decline.In 2022, incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses grew 14.1% while earned premiums grew 8.3%. The combined ratio – a key measure of profitability for insurers – deteriorated as well, to 102.7% in 2022, from 99.6% in 2021.The preliminary results, presented in the table below, are consolidated estimates based on annual statements filed by insurers with insurance regulators. The results are based on about 94% of all business written by U.S. property/casualty insurers.“The insurance industry is being hammered by increasing input costs, natural catastrophes, legal system abuse, and resistance in some states to adequate rates,” said Robert Gordon, senior vice president, policy, research &amp; international for APCIA. “Insurers suffered a 14.1 percent increase in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses (16.6 percent in Q4), contributing to a more than $76 billion contraction in insurers’ surplus at a time when loss exposures are rapidly growing. In 2023, insurers are faced with a significant challenge to close the rate gap in order to meet their growing cost of capital.”“Hurricane Ian and the effects of inflation resulted in major losses for property insurers last year, while accident severity continued to plague personal and commercial auto lines,” said Neil Spector, president of underwriting solutions at Verisk. “To remain profitable in these challenging times, many insurers are looking for new ways to reduce expenses, increase efficiencies, and enhance the customer experience. And they’re finding help from an ecosystem of advanced technology and analytics that is growing every day.”Story continuesPolicyholders’ surplus recovered somewhat from Q3 2022’s $911.7 billion to $952.4 billion, but still remains below that of year-end 2021 driven primarily by the large amount of unrealized capital losses accrued during 2022. Insurers’ rate of return on average policyholders’ surplus, a measure of overall profitability, declined to 4.2% in 2022 from 6.4% in 2021.Fourth Quarter Sees Continued Growth in Net Written PremiumsThe industry’s net income fell to $10.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2022 from $19.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2021, and the annualized rate of return on average surplus fell to 4.4% from 7.9% a year prior.Net written premiums rose $13.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2022, or 8.2%, compared to a year earlier. Net underwriting losses declined to $5.5 billion in fourth-quarter 2022 from $1.8 billion in gains a year earlier, and the combined ratio deteriorated to 104.0% from 100.0% a year prior.Note: The results above are based on annual statements filed with insurance regulators by private property/casualty insurers domiciled in the United States, including excess and surplus insurers and domestic insur­ers owned by foreign parents, and excluding state funds for workers’ compensation and other residual market insurers, the National Flood Insurance Program, foreign insurers, and reinsurers. The figures are consolidated estimates based on reports accounting for about 94% of all business written by U.S. property/casualty insurers. All figures are net of reinsurance unless otherwise noted and occasionally may not balance due to rounding.About VeriskVerisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

For more mutual fund companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Mutual Fund Companies in the World. The finance market of 2023 is significantly different from that a couple of decades back. There are numerous investment vehicles in which both ordinary and institutional investors can invest their funds and ensure a stable return. Some of the asset classes in which investors can place their money include equities, real estate, bonds, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and money market vehicles. These are broad categories since each of these has a variety of other investment options within them. For instance, the money market vehicle sector consists of several investment vehicles such as short term treasury bonds, commercial papers, money market mutual funds, deposit certificates, commercial papers, and repurchase agreements.At the same time, while investors can simply pick and choose stocks of their choice for investment, there are other options as well that allow them to leverage professional expertise when allocating their money. Two kinds of investment vehicles that are commonly available are exchange traded funds and mutual funds. Out of these, the former is a collection of different shares with investment allocations based on a percentage whose single unit is sold throughout the trading day. The latter is also a basket of securities but is usually traded only once a day. There are several ways in which investors can profit from a mutual fund. These include making gains through an increase in the value of the fund itself, or through dividends, if the basket of securities that the fund invests in is made up of dividend paying stocks. Additionally, alongside stocks, mutual funds also invest in bonds, and some of the benefits that they offer include diversification, low costs, and liquidity.Mutual funds are also some of the most popular investment vehicles in the U.S. According to statistics from ICI Global, more than half of American households owned a mutual fund last year. In numerical terms, this entails that 52.3% of the 68.6 million American households had owned mutual funds in 2022, leading to an approximate number of 115.3 million individuals having invested in the investment vehicles. More than two thirds of these were earning less than $150,000 annually, and 54% of the households holding mutual funds were led by individuals whose ages ranged between 35 and 64 years, and most of these were not making significant amounts of money, as the research also shows that the median household income of these individuals was $100,000. In statistics, the median of a data sample is its middle set of values, which removes the effects of outliers in reaching conclusions.Story continuesAt the same time, the median income of these households was higher than the median income of all American households, which stood at $69,000 during the surveyed time period. The households that had owned mutual funds had higher education levels as well, with 80% having completed education higher than an Associate degree while the average American household saw only 66% with similar education levels. Finally, the majority, or 81%, of these investors had invested in stock market mutual funds, with money market mutual funds coming in at second place with 50% of households having invested in them.In terms of market value, the U.S. mutual fund market is one of the biggest in the world. Data from Refinitiv shows that the U.S. fund market, made up of both ETFs and mutual funds, was worth $29.3 trillion as of December 2022. Fund returns last year matched the macroeconomic environment, with commodities funds posting an 8% annual return, while equity, taxable fixed income, and global equities dropped by 16.8%, 8.5%, and 12.8%, respectively. The turmoil in the financial market has continued this year as well, with the collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) reducing confidence in the banking system and causing an outflow of funds into the money market segment instead.According to a report from the Financial Times, weekly inflows into money market funds crossed $120 billion during March 2023 in the aftermath of the SVB disaster, with $93 billion of funds flowing in just two days. The $120 billion in inflows was also almost half of the amount that has flown into money market funds this year, as FT estimates this figure to stand at $250 billion.The sheer scale of the American mutual funds market is evident when we take a look at the global market. A research report from Technavio believes that the global funds market is estimated to grow by $71.6 trillion between 2022 and 2027, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.76%. Out of the total market size, North America will be the largest contributor, as it will account for 52% of the total market.So when should you invest in mutual funds? Fisher Investments' Ken Fisher believes that a key reason for buying a mutual fund is if you believe that the fund manager is a better investor than you are. He adds that:If however, you have very small amounts of money, you can't do that (buy the same stocks as those tracked by the fund). Because the costs of the stocks still remain low, but if you have very small amounts of money, you can't diversify. And there's a huge benefit to diversification. So you can get that diversification through the ETF or the mutual fund, other things being equal, usually I would prefer the ETF to the mutual fund because it tends to be more tax efficient. Costs tend to be lower, but not necessarily lower.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest mutual fund companies in the world, with the top ones being The Vanguard Group, Inc., BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Fidelity Investments.15 Biggest Mutual Fund Companies In The WorldPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur Methodology We used data from Morningstar's Fund Family reports for the U.S. and Europe to pick the biggest mutual fund companies in the world.

If you want to explore similar websites, you can also take a look at 3 Best Insider Trading Websites in 2023.An insider is a person who has access to non-public or confidential information about a corporation. Insiders can include executives, board members, major shareholders, and other employees who have access to sensitive information that is not available to the public. Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of securities, such as stocks or bonds, based on material non-public information.Insider trading is only illegal when an insider uses confidential information that is not available to the public to make a profit or avoid a loss by trading securities. Insiders are free to trade otherwise. Insider trading has proven to be one of the most underrated and successful stock market anomalies of all time. There is a significant body of academic literature that has identified correlations between insider trading and abnormal investment returns.A Review of The Profitability of Insider TradingIn 1968, Professors James H. Lorie and Victor Niederhoffer conducted one of the earliest academic researches to determine the profitability of insider trading. Their paper employed a rigorous methodology and demonstrated a strong correlation between insider transactions and abnormal returns. When tracking the returns on insider purchases, they found that when the number of buyers was at least two more than the number of sellers, insiders could generate above-market returns over a six-month period. The same was the case for tracking the returns for insider selling.In 1974, Wharton professor Jeffrey Jaffe conducted a research to identify a relationship between abnormal returns and insider transactions. He constructed a zero investment portfolio that was long in companies with more insider purchases and short in companies with more insider sales in a given month. Though his study did not find any abnormal returns, even after constraining the sample to only large transactions of at least $20,000, when Jaffe employed an intensive trading criteria he found a strong correlation between insider trading and anomalous returns. When there were at least three buyers and three sellers from each company to be included in the long and short portfolios, respectively, Jaffe found abnormal returns of 5.07% in the first eight months following the transactions. Even when he included each company in the portfolio two months after the transaction, he still found abnormal returns of 4.84% in the first eight months. Hence, Jaffe's conclusion was that outsiders can also make abnormal profits by mimicking insider activity.Story continuesIn 1976 Joseph Finnerty, a researcher at the University of Michigan, published a paper that established a correlation between insider trading and its returns. Finnerty did not employ an intensive trading criteria. He found that insider purchases had abnormal returns of 4.1% within the initial six months, and insider sales had abnormal returns of -2.4% within the same time period.In 1986 Nejat Seyhun, a professor at the University of Michigan, conducted a study to evaluate anomalous returns tied to insider trading by taking into account the size of the company. He found that insiders in small companies exhibited more purchases than sales. Seyhun also found that insiders generated anomalous returns of 4.3% within the initial 300 days when insiders were net purchasers. He also found that insiders generated anomalous returns of -2.2% in the same duration for companies when insiders were net sellers. He pointed out that adopting intensive trading criteria produced similar outcomes. Seyhun discovered that all types of insiders obtain statistically significant abnormal returns and there is a hierarchy that varies these returns. Seyhun found that major shareholders had the highest returns, and they were followed by officer-directors, and finally officers. His work suggests that insider type, company size, and transaction size are independent factors that influence the anomalous returns of insiders.In 2001, Lakonishok and Lee conducted a study that analyzed insider trading returns using data from all companies between 1975 and 1995. They also examined how aggregate insider trading could serve as a signal for stock market index movements. They discovered that the net purchase ratio was indicative of insider sentiment. They calculated the net purchase ratio for each month by subtracting sales from purchases and dividing by total insider transactions over 5 years. When the net purchase ratio was in the top quintile, insiders were the most optimistic and the stock market increased by an average of 21.2% during the following 12 months. On the other hand, when the ratio was in the bottom quintile, insiders were the most pessimistic and the stock market returned an average of 8.1% over the next 12 months. This suggests that aggregate insider trading has some predictive power for the future direction of the stock market. Furthermore, Lakonishok and Lee found that companies with extensive insider purchases outperformed those with extensive insider sales by 7.8% over the following 12 months. However, insider purchases were more prevalent in small and high book-to-market companies, while insider sales were more common in larger and low book-to-market companies. When adjusted for size and book-to-market effects, anomalous returns fell to 4.8%. This study indicates that insider trading is more informative in smaller firms.In 2003, Leslie A. Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser from Harvard University, along with Andrew Metrick from Yale University, computed real returns of insider transactions without consensus data for insider transactions. These researchers calculated returns immediately after an insider executed a transaction, as opposed to when the trade was made public. They did not find a strong correlation between anomalous returns and insider sales, however, they did find a strong correlation between anomalous returns and insider purchases. The raw returns of insider purchases outperformed the market by 11.2% on an annualized basis. When adjusted for book-to-market effects and size, these returns beat the market by 6.4% on an annualized basis.In 2012 a study conducted by Kaspar Dardas, a research assistant at the European Business School in Wiesbaden, Germany, found a strong correlation between insider transactions and abnormal returns. Dardas sampled European insider transactions between January 2002 and December 2009 from 17 different Western European countries. He found that insider purchase transactions were associated with long-term positive excess returns, while insider sell transactions were associated with long-term negative excess returns. He also developed a method for identifying the most informative insider transactions, categorizing each transaction as a ""low conviction"", ""medium conviction"", or ""high conviction"" trade. The results showed that ""high conviction"" insider purchases generated an average 12-month excess return of 20.94% out-of-sample, while ""medium conviction"" purchases generated 1.32%, and ""low conviction"" purchases generated -3.40%.Insider trading is a controversial practice because it gives an unfair advantage to those who have access to privileged information, and it undermines the integrity of the financial markets. Despite its controversial nature, insider trading has been highly profitable for those who have managed to comply with regulations and engage in it. As pointed out by the studies above, it may be lucrative for outsiders to try to mimic insider behavior by analyzing public information and trading on the same trends as them.Consensus Criteria Reigns KingTracking insider trading can be a useful tool for retail investors, but it's important to note that insider trading alone may not guarantee market-beating returns. As pointed out above, there are multiple independent factors that influence returns on insider trades differently. One of the simplest things investors can do is look at the number of insiders that are buying and compare it to the number of insiders that are selling in order to determine whether to go long or sell short. If a large number of insiders are buying shares of a company, it may indicate that they have a positive outlook on the company's prospects. The same applies for a large number of insiders selling shares. Investors can look for patterns in insider buying or selling, and check if consensus criteria is met. Additionally, investors can pay attention to significant transactions, such as large purchases or sales of shares, by insiders. These transactions may be indicative of insiders' confidence in a company's future performance.In order to stay ahead of the market, understanding insider trading is key.

Nocera joined Julie Hyman and Brad Smith on Yahoo! Finance Live as the Senate's hearing on banking turmoil was underway. He says he was ""stunned"" by Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr's testimony statement, which says ""it is not the job of supervisors to fix the issues identified; it is the job of the bank's senior management and board of directors to fix its problems."" The problems present in the banking sector should be addressed, Nocera says, by bringing back the ""sensible regulations"" originally imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar.""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.Key Video Moments:00:00:25 Bring back the stress test00:00:36 Reimpose regulations from 200800:00:50 Problems could've been avoided if proper regulations had been in placeTo listen to our full conversation with Joe Nocera, click here.]"

9,77d04b61-a808-318f-95d3-62f80ebe4ee4,WDC,2023-03-29,Returns On Capital Signal Difficult Times Ahead For Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-signal-difficult-times-151325125.html,1680016405,STORY,['WDC'],"[When researching a stock for investment, what can tell us that the company is in decline? Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. So after we looked into Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), the trends above didn't look too great.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Western Digital, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$872m ÷ (US$25b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Western Digital has an ROCE of 4.2%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Tech industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital roceIn the above chart we have measured Western Digital's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Western Digital.The Trend Of ROCEThere is reason to be cautious about Western Digital, given the returns are trending downwards. To be more specific, the ROCE was 13% five years ago, but since then it has dropped noticeably. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Western Digital becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Western Digital's ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 58% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.If you'd like to know more about Western Digital, we've spotted   2 warning signs,  and 1 of them is potentially serious.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.""The Initial Move Is Almost Always A Head Fake""On March 22, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, in-line with market consensus. On March 25, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on this move by the Fed and what he sees for the markets ahead. Cramer was expecting a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed, however, he thinks that the Fed ""was a bit more hawkish"" than he anticipated in light of the banking crisis. Cramer noted that though the Fed is suggesting moving interest rates higher than the current level, the Fed funds futures indicate 8 cuts by the back half of 2023.Cramer pointed out an interesting pattern that the markets have followed over the past year after every FOMC meeting since March 2022. Cramer thinks that this pattern can be insightful and can potentially guide the direction of the market in the near-term. Cramer noted that before the March 2022 rate hike, the intraday average movement of the S&amp;P 500 in either direction was 1.15%. He defined this as the baseline and pointed out that out of 9 times the Fed has raised interest rates, 7 times the S&amp;P 500 exhibited a bigger move than its intraday average. Cramer's analysis shows that the initial 3-day move of the markets, after the Fed's rate hike, reverses in the following 3 months. This has held true for 7 out of 8 times over the Fed's hiking cycle, that began in March 2022. Cramer thinks that ""the initial move is almost always a head fake"".While the pattern is noteworthy, Jim Cramer thinks that it is ""dangerous to predict we're going to rally over the next 3 months"", especially amid the banking crisis. The key takeaway for investors according to Cramer is that ""the initial reaction of the Fed's rate hikes has been wrong, every time, over the past year"".Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best cheap stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer.

These funds disclosed collective stakes worth $846.7 million in the company.As of December 31, Citadel Investment Group is the top shareholder in M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) and has disclosed a position worth $298.4 million.9. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24PE Ratio (TTM) as of March 28: 10.20At the end of Q4 2022, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) was held by 24 hedge funds. These funds disclosed positions worth $242.4 million in the company, up from $221.6 million in the previous quarter when 21 hedge funds held stakes in the company. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.On March 2, Scotiabank analyst Tristan Richardson started coverage of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) with an Outperform rating and a $31 price target.In one of his recent episodes, Jim Cramer recommended Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) to one of his callers over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET). Cramer noted that while Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET) is offering a higher yield than his preference, he still prefers Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET).As of March 28, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is trading at a TTM PE ratio of 10.20 and is offering a forward dividend yield of 7.73%. Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(NYSE:EPD) and has a stake worth $99.9 million.Legacy Ridge Capital made the following comment about Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio.

Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $215 million compared with $174.6 million in the prior-year quarter.

The metric also included $21 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment moved up 3% year over year.

""This is what I've always wanted in my life and I'm not talking just about a roof over my head, necessarily. But, I've always wanted to be able to provide a forever home for my family.""Luptak's wife, Jessica, and their two children, Lily and Luke, were the first U.S. Bank HOME (Housing Opportunities after Military Engagement) program recipients in Tennessee. They join 22 other veteran families who have received mortgage-free homes since 2013. The 23 total donated homes in thriving communities across the country are valued over $5 million.""It is such an honor to partner with organizations like Freedom Alliance who make a difference in our communities, especially our veteran communities,"" said Len McMorrow, senior vice president of default recovery &amp; litigation at U.S. Bank. ""Our U.S. Bank HOME program allows a deserving, honorable veteran like Xanthin and his family to begin a new chapter in a mortgage-free home. We are excited for the Luptak family to get settled in Tennessee and enjoy all that the community offers.""Since Luptak was a young boy, he wanted to be a soldier. He enlisted in the Indiana National Guard at the age of 17. In 2007, he served a 15-month deployment to Iraq where he performed dangerous route clearing missions such as removing bombs to create safer passage for U.S. troops. While stationed in Colorado in 2010, he met his wife and then received a temporary assignment at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he trained cadets on route clearance operations. A second deployment in 2011 sent him to Afghanistan, where Luptak trained Afghan police on these same procedures. During his deployments, he survived repeated engagement with enemy forces but was severely wounded. He was exposed to dangerous toxins from burn pits, and when he was examined prior to surgery for his combat injuries, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Luptak underwent chemotherapy and is in remission. He was medically discharged in 2017.Story continues""March 2023 marks 20 years since the beginning of the Iraq war. There have been a lot of sacrifices made by our military personnel and so it's really fitting during this time that we can present Xanthin and his family with their new home,"" said President of Freedom Alliance Tom Kilgannon.Freedom Alliance provides mortgage-free homes, specially outfitted wheelchairs, home repairs, vehicles, and scholarships to students of military personnel who are injured or killed in service. There is an application and screening process to match and award homes such as the one presented to Luptak.""I feel nothing but a clean slate in moving forward with a better future,"" said Luptak.

AVTR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 and operational workflow also looks promising. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and foreign exchange fluctuations are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 39.3% compared with the 30% decline of the industry and 15.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of mission-critical products and services has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion. The company projects 12.8% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Avantor surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.9%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Operational Workflow: We are optimistic about Avantor’s more than 200 facilities strategically located worldwide, including manufacturing, distribution, service, research &amp; technology and sales centers. The company operates over 30 global manufacturing facilities, including 16 facilities that are current good manufacturing practice compliant and 13 facilities that have been registered with the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Avantor’s portfolio, which includes a comprehensive range of products and services that allows it to create customized and integrated solutions for its customers. These products and services enable the company’s customers to achieve precise analytical results in their operations.Avantor’s e-commerce platform makes it easy for customers to do business with the company and enables digital marketing efforts that position it to capture new demand.Strong Q4 Results: Avantor registered a robust year-over-year uptick in overall and segmental core organic sales in fourth quarter of 2022. Strength in Avantor’s end markets was also witnessed. The company’s pipeline of new product launches and robust demand from its bioproduction customers for its end-to-end fluid management solution also raise optimism. The continued demand for Avantor’s Ritter and Masterflex products also augurs well. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Avantor faces competition across its products and the markets in which it operates. The company competes on various fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies providing similar offerings. Avantor’s competitors range from regional to large multinational companies. Such greater resources may allow Avantor’s competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies.Forex Woes: A substantial amount of Avantor’s revenues is derived from international operations. Avantor also anticipates that a significant portion of its sales will continue to come from international markets in the future. The revenues reported by Avantor with respect to its operations outside of the United States may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Estimate TrendAvantor has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 0.7% north to $1.41.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, suggesting a 9.4% decline from the year-ago reported number.This compares to our first-quarter 2023 revenue estimate of $1.76 billion, suggesting a 9.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

All the big retail names were there including the tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and PayPal (PYPL), as well as giants of main street such as Foot Locker (FL) and Walmart (WMT).First, AI - artificial intelligence - is having its moment. It’s the ultimate buzzword in the field of investing, and AI was definitely on display at Shoptalk 2023. Tech companies are working with retailers to monetize a lot of the big data they’re collecting in real time. “I think as we see this next generation of AI it’s really powerful. And I think one of the most important questions out there is what are people going to ask it to do?” Pinterest CEO Bill Ready told us. The second major trend at Shoptalk was shipping.Retailers are battling to get all those products you buy online to your doorstep even faster. Shipt, which is owned by Target (TGT), is one of the big players. Twenty two billion packages are shipped every year in the United States according to a recent study by Pitney Bowes (PBI).

""The Americans with Disabilities Act was created to protect employees like [her].""Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said it was reviewing the complaint.""We have been a top employer for those with disabilities for years and have thousands of associates who perform their jobs with reasonable accommodation,"" it said.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.""The Initial Move Is Almost Always A Head Fake""On March 22, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, in-line with market consensus. On March 25, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on this move by the Fed and what he sees for the markets ahead. Cramer was expecting a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed, however, he thinks that the Fed ""was a bit more hawkish"" than he anticipated in light of the banking crisis. Cramer noted that though the Fed is suggesting moving interest rates higher than the current level, the Fed funds futures indicate 8 cuts by the back half of 2023.Cramer pointed out an interesting pattern that the markets have followed over the past year after every FOMC meeting since March 2022. Cramer thinks that this pattern can be insightful and can potentially guide the direction of the market in the near-term. Cramer noted that before the March 2022 rate hike, the intraday average movement of the S&amp;P 500 in either direction was 1.15%. He defined this as the baseline and pointed out that out of 9 times the Fed has raised interest rates, 7 times the S&amp;P 500 exhibited a bigger move than its intraday average. Cramer's analysis shows that the initial 3-day move of the markets, after the Fed's rate hike, reverses in the following 3 months. This has held true for 7 out of 8 times over the Fed's hiking cycle, that began in March 2022. Cramer thinks that ""the initial move is almost always a head fake"".While the pattern is noteworthy, Jim Cramer thinks that it is ""dangerous to predict we're going to rally over the next 3 months"", especially amid the banking crisis. The key takeaway for investors according to Cramer is that ""the initial reaction of the Fed's rate hikes has been wrong, every time, over the past year"".Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best cheap stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8.

40,7990b0b4-bf59-3fd9-92a7-7c1111a418f4,O,2023-03-29,Group: Oil tanker tied to US-traded firm receiving Iran oil,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/group-oil-tanker-tied-us-113142933.html,1680089502,STORY,"['EURN.BR', 'CL=F']","[DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An oil tanker owned by a major U.S.-traded transportation company appears to be taking on Iranian crude oil in a key Asian maritime strait in violation of American sanctions, an advocacy group alleges. The firm allegedly involved, Euronav, said Wednesday it will “take appropriate action when necessary.""Satellite photos and maritime tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put the Belgian-flagged crude oil tanker Oceania just next to the Vietnamese-flagged tanker Abyss for a possible ship-to-ship transfer. The group United Against Nuclear Iran has warned the Oceania's owner, the Antwerp-based Euronav, that it believes the Abyss took on Iranian crude oil in late February.The suspicion comes as Iran remains able to trade its crude oil at sea despite American sanctions snapping back into place after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Now, nearly five years later, Iran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels while continuing to sell its oil and supplying bomb-carrying drones to Russia to fuel Moscow's war on Ukraine.Brian Gallagher, a spokesman for Euronav, told the AP in a statement that the company “has and always has taken all the appropriate measures and protocols to ensure we are in compliance with all regulations.”“All cargoes within our system have passed these requirements,” Gallagher wrote. “Euronav will continue to monitor any specific shipments and take appropriate action where necessary.”Gallagher said the Oceania was a storage vessel and the cargo from the Abyss was for “a third party NOT directly with Euronav.” He added if the allegation the oil is Iranian is proven, “the cargo will be returned to the third party who delivered it.”Euronav trades on the New York Stock Exchange.The U.S. Treasury declined to immediately comment. The Abyss' manager did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Story continuesSatellite images from Planet Labs PBC and data from the ships' Automatic Identification System trackers put the vessels on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia. In an image on Tuesday, tug boats were pushing the Abyss toward the Oceania.Tracking data from MarineTraffic.com showed the vessels alongside each other on Wednesday. At sea, oil tankers can funnel crude between each other in a ship-to-ship transfer that typically sees boats in a similar position.In a letter dated Tuesday to Euronav, United Against Nuclear Iran said it believed the Abyss took on crude oil at the Iranian port of Bandar Mashahr, some 600 kilometer (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran, on the Persian Gulf. The Abyss had turned off its AIS tracker on Feb. 18 as it was pointed toward Bandar Mashahr.Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on for safety reason, but vessels believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements over the international sanctions Tehran faces.A ship corresponding to the Abyss' size and features could be seen docked at Bandar Mashahr on Feb. 22 in a satellite photo analyzed by the AP. United Against Nuclear Iran said it found a satellite image it believed showed the Abyss at the port in the same position the day before.“Any other signs of manipulating AIS transponders should be considered red flags for potential illicit activity,” the New York-based group said in its letter signed by Mark Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.The Abyss is managed by Ho Chi Minh City-based PetroVietnam Transportation. Vietnamese vessels have been suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil in the past. Smugglers typically misidentify where the crude oil they carry came from in order to skirt suspicions.Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is not the first time a U.S.-linked firm has been associated with an Iranian oil transfer at sea. In February 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran warned Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management that it believed a tanker the firm owned took on Iranian crude oil.The U.S. government has said illicit Iranian oil revenue funds the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, an expeditionary unit believed to be working abroad in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to back Iranian-allied militias.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.]"

42,add0f5ff-f38d-3460-8f28-9fc46e43d4df,O,2023-03-29,Petrobras (PBR) to Boost Oil Production Amid Climate Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-pbr-boost-oil-production-103310019.html,1680085990,STORY,"['PETR3.SA', 'CL=F', 'NG=F', 'PBR-A', 'HLX']","[Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras (PBR) has been in the news recently for its bold decision to ramp up oil production despite pressure from climate change activists and rising concerns over the future of the oil industry. The CEO of Brazil's state-owned oil company, Jean Paul Prates, believes that they should continue to increase fossil fuel production for several decades despite the global energy transition.According to a recent report, Petrobras plans to increase its oil production to 2.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2025, up from the current level of 2.2 mb/d. This move has raised eyebrows among environmentalists, who have been calling for a reduction in fossil fuel production to combat climate change.Petrobras, however, seems unfazed by these concerns and has vowed to continue investing in oil exploration and production. In fact, the company has been actively seeking new oil fields in Brazil and abroad, including Africa and the Gulf of Mexico.The global oil industry has been going through a rough patch in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in oil demand, as travel and transportation were restricted. As a result, oil prices fell, forcing many oil companies to halt production and lay off workers.Furthermore, the world is shifting toward renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydropower. Governments around the world are also implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. These trends have led to a decline in demand for oil and an increase in demand for alternative energy sources.Brazil is expected to produce 3.4 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2023, with further growth projected until 2030. However, investments will be necessary in order to maintain these levels.Why is Petrobras so Bent on Increasing Oil Production?One reason could be the sheer size of Petrobras and its significant role in the Brazilian economy. The company contributes around 10% to Brazil's GDP and has more than 45,000 employees. Any significant reduction in oil production could have a severe impact on the country's economy and its people.Story continuesAnother reason could be the current state of the oil industry that was affected by low prices and falling demand during the pandemic. Many smaller oil companies were forced to reduce production or even shut down entirely. However, Petrobras, with its size and resources, managed to weather the storm and emerge stronger.The company’s strategy is not without risks. It could face significant backlash from environmental groups and investors who are increasingly demanding a shift toward clean energy. Additionally, the future of the oil industry is uncertain, and Petrobras could find itself struggling if the demand for fossil fuels continues to decline.Despite the challenges, PBR still believes that there will be a demand for oil in the future. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.5% until 2026. However, the growth rate is expected to slow down after 2026, due to the increasing use of electric vehicles and the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies.In conclusion, Petrobras' decision to ramp up oil production amid increasing pressure from environmentalists and the uncertain future of the oil industry is a bold move. Let us wait and see if this move pays off in the long run.Petrobras, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, is a globally renowned Brazilian oil and gas company. It engages in various energy-related activities such as oil exploration, production, refining, trading, and transportation of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Petrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

45,d5578410-22ac-35a4-a178-173f29218116,O,2023-03-29,New California gas price law another defeat for oil industry,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-gas-price-law-another-235349574.html,1680047629,STORY,['CL=F'],"[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — It was just a few weeks ago that California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the oil industry the second most powerful force on earth, trailing only Mother Nature in its ability to bend the elements — both physical and political — to its will.Yet on Tuesday, Newsom signed a new law that gives state regulators the power to penalize oil companies for making too much money, the first of its kind in the country. It's the type of legislation the oil industry might have crushed in the past. But on Monday, the bill cleared the state Assembly with only one Democrat voting against it.“We proved we could finally beat big oil,” Newsom said Tuesday after signing the bill.The bill is the latest in a string of defeats for the oil industry in California, a state many don't think of as a fossil fuel powerhouse. But for decades, California was one of the leading oil producers in the United States with a bustling industry that was a key part of the state's economy. The state is now the nation's seventh-largest oil producer, according to federal data.The oil industry doesn’t mind a David vs. Goliath comparison “as long as you think we’re David and not Goliath,” Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, said about the industry’s influence at the state Capitol. “Just look at the results the last couple of years on legislation.”Oil production has been steadily declining since the late 1980s from a combination of exhausting supplies and the state's changing policy priorities. A state law requires California to be carbon neutral by 2045, meaning the state would remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state's plan to do so would reduce demand for liquid petroleum by 94% by 2045.State regulators have banned the sale of most new gas-powered cars in California by 2035. And last year, the state Legislature approved a bill limiting where new oil wells can be drilled, providing buffer zones around homes, schools and other sensitive sites.Story continues“We're never going to get it right, in terms of this transition (away from oil), unless we minimize and mitigate the power and influence of big oil in this country,” said Newsom, now in his second term in office and widely seen as a potential presidential candidate beyond 2024. “They're the biggest impediment to a just transition.”While its influence in California might have diminished, the industry is still asserting itself. The Western States Petroleum Association spent $11.7 million lobbying lawmakers in the 2021-2022 legislative session, far more than any other single group. Chevron followed behind it, spending $8.6 million, according to state campaign finance filings. The next closest single spender was the California Teachers Association, at $7.1 million.Likewise, the industry spent millions on campaign contributions in the 2022 election, supporting both Democrats and Republicans. More than a quarter of all 120 seats in the Legislature are newly elected members.Those donations did not always translate to favorable votes. New Assemblymember Esmerelda Soria, a Democrat who represents parts of the Central Valley, was the top beneficiary of money from a Western States Petroleum Association-affiliated committee. Soria voted Monday to support the legislation despite industry opposition.The only Democrat to vote against the potential oil profits penalty was Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, whose district includes Kern County, home of the state's oil industry. Her vote appeared to irk the Newsom administration.Bains, a family medicine and addiction doctor who was first elected in November, tweeted a picture of the vote, saying: “Stand alone if you must, but always stand for truth.”Dana Williamson, Newsom’s chief of staff, replied: “Alone and confused you shall likely remain.”Bains said she voted against the bill because during the height of the gasoline price spike last summer, the Newsom administration and legislative leaders refused to suspend the state’s gas tax. They argued oil companies would not pass along the savings to drivers.“What’s to stop them from passing on the cost of this new tax with high prices at the pump?” Bains said. “That inconsistency is even more frustrating.”Though the industry couldn't stop the legislation, its presence could be felt in the final version, said Chris Micheli, a veteran California lobbyist who represents business clients but was not involved in the oil profits legislation. Newsom initially called for the Legislature to pass a new tax on oil company profits. Then he asked lawmakers to instead impose a penalty if oil company profits surpassed a certain threshold.Finally, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to let the California Energy Commission decide, punting the decision to a five-person panel appointed by Newsom with the consent of the state Senate. The bill also creates a new state agency with the power to monitor the petroleum markets, including requiring oil companies to disclose lots of data about their pricing.“The fact it took them three different substantive proposals to find something that would actually pass the Legislature I think goes to show the continued power and influence of the oil industry in this state,” Micheli said.Next year, the oil industry will be looking to exert its influence in another arena — public opinion. The industry is challenging a new state law that bans drilling new oil wells nearby homes, schools and other sensitive areas. Voters will decide in 2024 whether to uphold the law.“The partisan numbers of the two houses of the Legislature have dramatically changed,” Micheli said, referring to Democrats now having total control over state government. “The broader business community is going to have to go to the voters on some issues of public policy.”Newsom acknowledged Monday the importance of oil for the global economy, telling reporters: “I'm driving home tonight” and “I'm flying this weekend.”“Oil has built the American economy, built the industrial economy, I get it,"" Newsom said. “But we are transitioning. And all I'm asking for is don't rip us off anymore.”]"

Production had been on a rising production trend at that point, up from about 1.4 million bpd in 2000, and the country still had around 48 billion barrels of proved crude oil reserves – the largest in Africa. Although this output level was well below the peak levels of more than 3 million bpd achieved in the late 1960s, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) had plans in place before 2011 to roll out enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to increase crude oil production at maturing oil fields. These plans were put on hold due to an increase in sectarian hostilities across the country but they are back in place now. A new ‘Strategic Programs Office’ (SPO) has been created by the NOC and it will orchestrate a rise in Libya’s production capacity to 2 million bpd in the next three to five years, according to a recent comment from NOC chairman, Farhat Bengdara.Key to this plan succeeding will be the investment of international oil companies (IOCs), but there is a foundation of IOC interest to build upon. Prior to the removal of Gaddafi in 2011, numerous high-profile IOCs were either operating in Libya or had plans to. Given the civil war that has been raging on and off since Gaddafi’s removal, this number has dwindled, but a few hardy IOCs are still there, currently with a focus on Libya’s gas. One such company is Italy’s Eni, which – along with France’s TotalEnergies and the UK’s BP and Shell – have been at the vanguard of Europe’s efforts to secure alternative energy supplies to those from Russia, following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The government in Rome has pledged to eliminate Russian gas by 2025 and, to this end, has announced several new short- and medium-term measures to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline flows from other sources.Story continuesRelated: Oil’s Low Prices Draw Rash Of HedgingRecently, the Italian oil and gas giant signed an agreement with the NOC that would see it invest around US$8 billion to produce about 850 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) from two offshore gas fields in the Mediterranean Sea. The deal – as stated by the NOC’s Bengdara - would involve the renewal of an existing agreement originally struck in 2008. Eni currently produces gas in Libya from its Wafa and Bahr Essalam fields operated by Mellitah Oil &amp; Gas, a joint venture between the Italian company and the NOC. According to Eni, gas from the fields is transported to Italy through the 520 kilometre 8 billion cubic metres per year (bcm/y) Green Stream pipeline that crosses the Mediterranean Sea and lands in Gela in Sicily. These gas flows were interrupted at the beginning of the year due to unscheduled maintenance at the Mellitah Complex, according to Eni, but have since been restored to full capacity. It may be, therefore, that Italy is seeking to secure the stability of its gas supplies from Libya through further investment from its key oil and gas companies into the country and, more broadly, into other target suppliers in the region.Prior to this, Bengdara had also stated that he expected a separate program of offshore and onshore drilling to start within the coming months, under the leadership not just of Eni but of BP and TotalEnergies too. Back in April 2021, at a meeting between then-NOC chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, and the chief executive officer of TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, the French firm agreed to continue with its efforts to increase oil production from the giant Waha, Sharara, Mabruk and Al Jurf oil fields by at least 175,000 bpd. It also agreed to make the development of the Waha-concession North Gialo and NC-98 oil fields a priority, according to the NOC.  The Waha concessions – in which the then-Total took a minority stake in 2019 – have the capacity to produce at least 350,000 bpd together, according to the NOC. The NOC added that the French firm would also “contribute to the maintenance of decaying equipment and crude oil transport lines that need replacing.”Having said this, the security and financial risks for IOCs working in Libya remain exceptionally high. Quite aside from the disjointed government apparatus and the ongoing civil war, the threat of further force majeures being implemented in key oil and gas hubs in the country remains ever present and is not likely to diminish any time soon. The root cause of this dates back to the lack of clarity in the agreement of 18 September 2020 as to how funds from Libya’s gas and oil sector would be divided up between the various warring political factions there.On that date just over two years ago, a deal was struck between Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the rebel Libyan National Army (LNA), and elements of the United Nations-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). In the deal, Haftar made it clear that the resultant lifting of the oil blockade then in place would not last unless a precise framework was agreed upon about precisely how oil revenues would be divided up between various groups from then on. Such a framework has still not been agreed and the failure to do so has resulted in a series of blockades of various ports and installations. These included most the 60,000 bpd Brega operation, and the Zueitina port, with crude loadings average around 90,000 bpd. Production also stopped at Abuatufol, Al-Intisar, Anakhla, and Nafura. Just prior to this, the Sharara field in the west of the country, which can pump around 300,000 bpd, was also shut down and before this the El Feel oil field, which produces 70,000 bpd, was closed.At various other points since then, farcical scenes have emerged at the top of the political structure in the country. July last year saw the GNU Prime Minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, replace the widely-respected Mustafa Sanalla as chairman of the NOC with Bengdara, who is a long-time associate and friend of Dbeibah’s. Sanalla - who had received backing from both of Libya’s opposing legislative bodies - rejected Dbeibah’s authority to sack him, and warned Dbeibah not to touch the NOC or the oil revenues and contracts that it manages. Bengdara then held his own news conference at the NOC headquarters building and received the backing of two major NOC affiliate companies - Al Waha Oil, and Arabian Gulf Oil - before Al Waha then deleted its message of support. All of this followed the failed attempt by Fathi Bashagha – appointed prime minister of the ‘alternative government’ in the east of the country three months before – to seize power in Tripoli. This occurred amid the ongoing refusal of the Dbeibah - who was appointed through a United Nations-led process in 2021 - to hand over power until such a time as a properly elected government was voted into office by the people of Libya.It might be that the need of the West to keep securing alternative energy supplies away from Russia may lead to pressure being brought to bear on the NOC and the various political factions causing mayhem in Libya. The key to this would be to finally push forward on the terms of the original September 2020 agreement signed by Haftar and Maiteeq that included the formation of a joint technical committee to deal with the oil money disbursements. According to the official statement at the time on the role of the proposed technical committee: “It will oversee oil revenues and ensure the fair distribution of resources… and control the implementation of the terms of the agreement.” In order to address the fact that the GNA effectively holds sway over the NOC and, by extension, the Central Bank of Libya (in which the revenues are physically held), the committee would also “prepare a unified budget that meets the needs of each party… and the reconciliation of any dispute over budget allocations… and will require the Central Bank [in Tripoli] to cover the monthly or quarterly payments approved in the budget without any delay, and as soon as the joint technical committee requests the transfer.”By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The Only Oil Major Betting Big On AlaskaHow Herd Mentality Sparked Chaos In Oil MarketsKurdistan’s 400,000-Bpd Oil Exports Still Shut-In As Talks With Iraq FailRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The reading usually heralds a similar trend from government data due later in the day, which is expected to show a negligible rise in inventories for the week.Brent oil futures rose 0.2% to $78.52 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.8% to $73.79 a barrel by 21:02 ET (01:02 GMT) . Both contracts were set to rise for a third straight session, as they recovered from 15-month lows hit last week.Oil prices marked a strong start to the week after Iraq halted exports of about 450,000 barrels per day- roughly 0.5% of daily global supply- from the Kurdistan region through Turkey after an arbitration showed that Baghdad’s approval was needed to ship the oil.Analysts said that continued disruptions in Kurdish supply could underpin oil prices this year, with Barclays (LON:BARC) positing an at least $3 upside to year-end prices.Easing concerns over a banking crisis also aided oil prices this week, as traders grew less fearful that a recession will dent oil demand this year.But on the other hand, union strikes in France and Germany ground economic activity in the two countries to a halt this week, pointing to some near-term weakness in oil demand. French refineries saw staggered operations, while German air travel and public transport were disrupted.Oil markets are now awaiting business activity data from China this week, to gauge the state of an economic recovery in the world’s largest crude importer.Story continuesBut analyst estimates see growth cooling in March from the prior month, as a post-COVID economic bounce runs out of steam.

The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector.

Despite macroeconomic challenges, results gained from the continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — along with pricing actions and strong consumer engagement.Management has been on track with its PVH+ Plan, which is likely to result in substantial cost efficiencies and better productivity. Per PVH, the business momentum continues to remain positive in 2023.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 3.9% against the industry's decline of 1.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q4 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $2.38 per share, down 16.2% from the year-ago quarter's $2.84. However, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 and our estimate of $1.63. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $2.18 per share compared with $5.53 in the prior-year quarter.In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenues rose 2% year over year (up 8% on a constant currency or cc basis) to $2,489 million. This is mainly due to the impacts of the Ukraine war, such as Russia store closures, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and a reduction in wholesale shipments to Ukraine. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,336 million and our estimate of $2,324 million.On the flip side, the company witnessed growth across Europe and North America, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business, along with continued strength in its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses. However, the company continues to witness negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in China.Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 4% year over year in the quarter, whereas Wholesale revenues remained flat year over year. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 8% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,390.5 million, down 1.8% year over year. The gross margin contracted 240 bps to 55.9% due to higher costs and increased promotions, which more than offset gains from price increases and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% year over year to $1,186.6 million. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $215 million compared with $174.6 million in the prior-year quarter. This mainly resulted from reduced expenses and revenue growth on a cc basis, which somewhat offset dismal gross margins. The metric also included $21 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment moved up 3% year over year. Sales from Calvin Klein North America advanced 8%, while the same for Calvin Klein International rose 1%.Revenues from the Tommy Hilfiger segment declined 1% year over year in the reported quarter.

For fiscal 2023, revenues are anticipated to grow 3-4% (up 2-3% on a cc basis). This is inclusive of less than 1% benefit from an additional week in 2023.The bottom line is expected to be $10 for the year, whereas it reported $3.03 on a GAAP basis and $8.97 on an adjusted basis last year. The view includes a positive impact of 15 cents from favorable currency. Also, the operating margin is estimated to be 10%. Interest expenses are likely to be $100 million, suggesting a decline from the prior year’s reported figure of $83 million, due to higher interest rates. Also, the effective tax rate is expected to be 24%.For first-quarter fiscal 2023, management expects revenues to remain flat year over year (up 3% on a cc basis). The bottom line is likely to be $1.90, whereas it reported $1.94 in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 10 cents.

SHOO is well-poised for growth, thanks to its sturdy digital efforts and other robust strategies, including international business expansion and brand strength. SHOO is witnessing strength in the e-commerce business against a tough operating backdrop. Solid gains from product assortments and direct-to-consumer channels also remain tailwinds.Markedly, shares of this renowned footwear dealer have risen 10.6% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 3.6% gain. For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Steven Madden’s sales and earnings per share is currently pegged at $2.05 billion and $2.68 each. These estimates suggest growth of 3.8% and 8.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s corresponding figures. This reflects analysts’ optimism about the company.Let’s Delve DeepSteven Madden remains committed to boosting its e-commerce wing via prudent investments in digital marketing as well as efforts to optimize the features and functionality of the website. Gains from increased investment in digital marketing and robust consumer capabilities such as “try before you buy” have been strengths. The company has also been significantly accelerating its digital commerce initiatives with respect to distribution. It has added high-level talent to the organization, ramped up digital marketing spending, improved data science capabilities, launched a try-before-you-buy payment facility, rolled out buy online, pick-up in store across its entire U.S. full-price retail outlets and introduced advanced delivery and return options.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough direct-to-consumer revenues were down 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, the metric was offset by a modest rise in e-commerce. Further, direct-to-consumer revenues rose 6.9% to $521.7 million in 2022, backed by increases in the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce businesses. Notably, direct-to-consumer revenues exceeded $500 million for the first time. Compared with the pre-pandemic 2019, direct-to-consumer revenues climbed 62%, including a 192% surge in digital. The overall direct-to-consumer penetration increased approximately 700 basis points in the aforesaid time.Story continuesAdditionally, management remains optimistic about its strategic agreements to enrich its presence. Management concluded the acquisition of the European joint venture. This transaction distributes the company’s branded footwear and accessories across the majority of countries in Europe. The buyout of BB Dakota, a California-based women's apparel company, through which SHOO is steadily expanding its apparel category, appears encouraging. One of the company’s major growth opportunities is expanding its international business.What’s More?On its last earnings call, management highlighted that 2022 marked a record year with respect to revenues and earnings. Consolidated revenues in the year were $2.1 billion, up 13.7% from 2021. Wholesale revenues also grew 16.4% on increases of 16.9% in wholesale footwear revenues and 14.8% in wholesale accessories revenues. The consolidated gross margin rose 10 basis points to 41.2% in 2022. Earnings came in at $2.80 per share, up from $2.50 per share earned in 2021. This is the highest in the company's history. The company crossed the $2 billion mark in revenues for the first time, including double-digit percentage increases on the top and the bottom lines in 2022.In 2022, the company’s accessories and apparel business surpassed $400 million in revenues and rose 13% versus 2021. The company’s handbags category rose 19% in the year. In apparel, management transitioned from the BB Dakota-Steve Madden co-brand to its namesake brand for the fall of 2022. The overall apparel revenues increased 38% in 2022. Results were driven by the power of its brands, the strength of its business model and the disciplined execution of its strategies.In a nutshell, the company is focused on driving growth across the direct-to-consumer business, expanding categories apart from footwear such as handbags and apparel, enhancing its presence in the international markets and reinforcing its core U.S. wholesale footwear business. Steven Madden is focused on creating a trend-right merchandise assortment, deepening relations with customers via marketing, enhancing the digital commerce agenda and efficiently controlling expenses. A VGM Score of A for this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock further speaks volumes.Eye These Solid PicksHere we have highlighted three top-ranked stocks, namely, Ralph Lauren RL, Oxford Industries OXM and Deckers DECK.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

62,001ac1e8-01c7-3cf5-a0b5-62d92970eb5b,MSFT,2023-03-29,What's better than OpenAI? Developers shop for alternatives,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-better-openai-developers-shop-110304417.html,1680087784,STORY,['MSFT'],"[By Krystal HuNEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft-backed OpenAI is no longer the only game in town for software developers looking to capitalize on an expected $90 billion market for artificial intelligence.Motivated by a wariness of relying on a single company, a desire for models tailored to specific tasks and the chance to cut costs, more than a dozen startups and investors said they are embracing competitors to industry leader OpenAI, casting a shadow on expectations that Microsoft Corp and OpenAI will dominate the young field.The shift by some software developers toward alternative AI foundation models shows how the next chapter of generative AI - defined as technology capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts - might unfold.George Mathew, an AI investor at Insight Partners, compared the AI foundation models to other technological breakthroughs which spawned competition. Foundation models are AI systems that are trained on large sets of data with the ability to learn to perform a variety of tasks.“Did we only have a single internet service provider?"" Mathew said. ""In a similar manner, we will need multiple foundational model providers for a healthy functioning ecosystem.”He added: ""The current head start that OpenAI has will not make it the only choice.""AI storytelling startup Tome, which helps users build slides faster, was originally built on GPT-3, a foundation model first released by OpenAI in 2020. Tome said it has hit 3 million users this month, and it started to experiment with other models.It has added a text model from OpenAI rival Anthropic to the mix, and plans to move from DALL-E, OpenAI’s photo generation model, to open-source model Stable Diffusion, which is made by Stability AI.The goal is to find the model that works best for each action with the least delay and the best quality, said Keith Peiris, Tome's chief executive.AI developers and investors said there is a new industry consensus to reduce reliance on a single model, in a bid to provide more reliable services, rein in costs and take advantage of the specialization of different models.Story continuesOpenAI shot to household-name status after its ChatGPT chatbot stunned many with its ability to answer complex questions in clear, grammatically correct language that appears human. It has attracted a $10 billion in investment from Microsoft, as big rivals including Alphabet Inc's Google as well as smaller firms are rushing to create new models.OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4 model is still the most powerful by many standards.OPENAI ALTERNATIVESThe market for generative AI is expected to grow to $98.1 billion by 2026, according to PitchBook.As the infrastructural layer of AI applications, foundation models have attracted the most investment from venture capitalists and strategic investors.

Foundation models are AI systems that are trained on large sets of data with the ability to learn to perform a variety of tasks.“Did we only have a single internet service provider?"" Mathew said. ""In a similar manner, we will need multiple foundational model providers for a healthy functioning ecosystem.”He added: ""The current head start that OpenAI has will not make it the only choice.""AI storytelling startup Tome, which helps users build slides faster, was originally built on GPT-3, a foundation model first released by OpenAI in 2020. Tome said it has hit 3 million users this month, and it started to experiment with other models.It has added a text model from OpenAI rival Anthropic to the mix, and plans to move from DALL-E, OpenAI’s photo generation model, to open-source model Stable Diffusion, which is made by Stability AI.The goal is to find the model that works best for each action with the least delay and the best quality, said Keith Peiris, Tome's chief executive.AI developers and investors said there is a new industry consensus to reduce reliance on a single model, in a bid to provide more reliable services, rein in costs and take advantage of the specialization of different models.Story continuesOpenAI shot to household-name status after its ChatGPT chatbot stunned many with its ability to answer complex questions in clear, grammatically correct language that appears human. It has attracted a $10 billion in investment from Microsoft, as big rivals including Alphabet Inc's Google as well as smaller firms are rushing to create new models.OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4 model is still the most powerful by many standards.OPENAI ALTERNATIVESThe market for generative AI is expected to grow to $98.1 billion by 2026, according to PitchBook.As the infrastructural layer of AI applications, foundation models have attracted the most investment from venture capitalists and strategic investors.

Security Copilot will combine Microsoft's vast threat intelligence footprint with industry-leading expertise to augment the work of security professionals through an easy-to-use AI assistant.""Today the odds remain stacked against cybersecurity professionals. Too often, they fight an asymmetric battle against relentless and sophisticated attackers,"" said Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president, Microsoft Security. ""With Security Copilot, we are shifting the balance of power into our favor. Security Copilot is the first and only generative AI security product enabling defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI.""Security Copilot is designed to work seamlessly with security teams, empowering defenders to see what is happening in their environment, learn from existing intelligence, correlate threat activity, and make more informed, efficient decisions at machine speed.Simplifying complexity and accelerating responsesIn a world where there are 1,287 password attacks per second, fragmented tools and infrastructure have not been enough to stop attackers. And although attacks have increased 67% over the past five years, the security industry has not been able to hire enough cyber risk professionals to keep pace. This has led to defenders who are overwhelmed searching for well-disguised attacks within an impossibly large volume of expanding network traffic and other signals.Security Copilot will simplify complexity and amplify the capabilities of security teams by summarizing and making sense of threat intelligence, helping defenders see through the noise of web traffic and identify malicious activity.Story continuesIt will also help security teams catch what others miss by correlating and summarizing data on attacks, prioritizing incidents and recommending the best course of action to swiftly remediate diverse threats, in time.Continually learning to augment the expertise of security teamsSecurity Copilot will also continually learn and improve to help ensure that security teams are operating with the latest knowledge of attackers, their tactics, techniques and procedures. The product will provide ongoing access to the most advanced OpenAI models to support demanding security tasks and applications. Its visibility into threats is powered by both the customer organization's security data and Microsoft's vast threat analysis footprint.These capabilities can empower security teams of any size with the skills and abilities of much larger organizations. In addition, Security Copilot helps address skills shortages in cybersecurity by bridging knowledge gaps and enhancing workflows, threat actor profiles and incident reporting across teams.""Advancing the state of security requires both people and technology — human ingenuity paired with the most advanced tools that help apply human expertise at speed and scale,"" said Charlie Bell, executive vice president, Microsoft Security. ""With Security Copilot we are building a future where every defender is empowered with the tools and technologies necessary to make the world a safer place.""Built on the Microsoft platform and industry-leading threat intelligenceMicrosoft is uniquely qualified to help customers explore and adapt AI to boost their cybersecurity defenses. Microsoft Security is actively tracking more than 50 ransomware gangs as well as more than 250 unique nation-state cybercriminal organizations, and receives 65 trillion threat signals every day. Microsoft technology blocks more than 25 billion brute-forced password theft attempts every second, and more than 8,000 security professionals at Microsoft analyze more security signals than almost any other company — on average Microsoft's Security Operations Center analysts utilize over 100 different data sources.Acquisitions like RiskIQ and Miburo give Microsoft breath of signal and depth intelligence on threat actors that no one else has. Security Copilot also integrates natively with a growing list of Microsoft Security products, such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, to help customers create an end-to-end experience across their entire security program.AvailabilityMicrosoft Security Copilot is currently available through private preview.

Some positive commentary from the Street on the heels of these results, RBC calling it, quote, ""a solid quarter"" here for the company.And this beat here coming amid the backdrop that the landscape here for Walgreens, as it is for a lot of its competitors, is changing post-COVID. We know testing, we know vaccines was a massive driver of some of their sales over the last 2 and 1/2 years. But the vaccines administered, that number dropping about 80% compared to a year ago.Testing off more than 90%, although, obviously, not a massive surprise.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, that's the big draw today. Profit down 20% on that. But look, their new CEO is focused. And I think the exciting opportunity if you are an investor in Walgreens has to be the entry into primary care and their continued focus on that through VillageMD. That is what you heard about a lot on the call today, added focus on primary care, which is a huge opportunity for Walgreens.Also, they did reference a massive employee shortage in terms of pharmacists. 1,900 stores are currently short-staffed and running less than full hours, which continues to be a problem for Walgreens' pharmacies across the country.

While Schutlz stepped down as CEO last week, he remains on the board of directors.One analyst predicts the hearing could send a ripple effect across the restaurant industry.""Starbucks may serve as a leading indicator of where the industry is headed"" when it comes to ""labor evolution,"" Sean Dunlop of Morningstar told Yahoo Finance.""Restauranteurs industrywide will be acutely aware of how this plays out,"" Dunlop said, who holds a three star rating on shares of Starbucks, equivalent to that of a Hold, and price target of $103. ""As labor shortages have started to abate and quit rates have ticked down, union momentum has slowed, as we’d expected—but the industry is far from 'through the woods' on these issues.""For almost two years, the Seattle-based chain has tussled with its workers unionizing. In December 2021, a Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, voted yes to unionize. Now the movement includes more than 290 company-owned stores that have voted to unionize. This, however, is a small percent of Starbuck's total U.S. footprint of 15,952 stores (as of Q1).""The actual number of stores that have voted to unionize remains small, roughly 3%-4% of the firm’s U.S. footprint,"" Dunlop noted,"" so any ramifications from higher labor costs and fewer part-time workers would barely touch the corporate (profit &amp; loss) P&amp;L.""Story continuesThe labor group behind the push, Starbucks Workers United, also filed more than 500 charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) citing unfair labor practices against workers trying to unionize, such as ""unlawfully interrogating employees about their union activities"" in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and ""threatening employees with loss of benefits and by removing and prohibiting union literature at three stores"" in Ann Arbor, Michigan, among others. In both of these complaints, an administrative law judge found that Starbucks violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz sits off stage to listen to soon to be Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan at Investor Day in Seattle, Washington Tuesday September 13, 2022. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)For the global coffee chain, Dunlop said, ""A lot of this comes down to optics and brand positioning.""""Starbucks has long been perceived as a leader in the restaurant space with respect to the employee value proposition, so to see the unionization push strike at the coffee chain reverberates across the rest of the industry.""He reiterated the benefits that Starbucks provides its employees, such as stock options and health insurance, among others in addition to wage investments that ""sent the industry down that path."" Last May, the company announced that all partners, which it calls its employees, hired on or before May 2, 2022 got either a 3% raise or $15/hour, whichever was higher.In response to the unionization efforts, Starbucks executives have said the company believes ""a side by side relationship with our partners is the very best path forward,"" as CFO Rachel Ruggeri told Yahoo Finance in November 2022.""Management’s line to workers has been that they can provide for them better (unilaterally) than Starbucks Workers United could,"" said Dunlop, who said the ""precedent that a union deal sets matters more than the deal itself.""""The real concern ties to whether a brokered deal incites more union momentum across Starbucks’ own system and potentially industrywide; if potential employees start favoring unionized stores, or if the firm has to move towards a less flexible scheduling model, it could create significant operational disruptions.""BIDDEFORD, ME - NOVEMBER 16: Starbucks workers in Biddeford participate in the Red Cup Rebellion, a nationwide strike demanding the company fully staff union stores and bargain in good faith. The one-day strike on Thursday was planned to coincide with the companys Red Cup Day, the annual event where customers receive free Starbucks cups with certain purchases.

And he pointed out that only around 1% of Starbucks’ 250,000 U.S. employees have elected to join a union.“We've done everything that we possibly can to respect the right under the law of our partners' ability to join a union,” Schultz said. “But conversely, we have consistently laid out our preference, without breaking any law, of communicating to our people what we believe is our vision for the company.”At least 293 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize since late 2021, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Starbucks Workers United, the labor group seeking to unionize stores, has yet to reach a contract agreement with the company at any Starbucks store.U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent who has been a vocal supporter of Starbucks labor organizers, accused the company of stalling. He said multiple federal courts and administrative judges at the NLRB have found Starbucks guilty of hundreds of labor law violations, including firing labor organizers and illegally closing unionized stores.“The fundamental issue we are confronting today is whether we have a system of justice that applies to all, or whether billionaires and large corporations can break the law with impunity,” Sanders said.Jaysin Saxton, a disabled U.S. Coast Guard veteran and former Starbucks shift supervisor, testified that the company fired him in July after he led a two-day strike at his Augusta, Georgia, store, which voted to unionize last spring. Saxton has filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB.Story continuesPrior to the union vote, Saxton said Starbucks flooded the store with managers who disciplined employees for minor violations and held required meetings where they threatened employees with a loss of benefits if they voted to unionize. After the union vote, he said, seven workers were fired and others at the store saw their hours cut.“Starbucks and big corporations have a lot of power and money and they are willing to pull out all the stops to deny workers a voice and a seat at the table,” he said.Schultz denied the company has broken the law and said Starbucks is appealing those charges. He said Starbucks respects workers' right to unionize but believes the company already provides its workers with industry-leading wages and benefits.He noted that Starbucks' average starting wage is $17.50, while the minimum wage in Vermont is $13.18.""I think unions have served an important role in American business for many years. In the ‘50s and ’60s, unions generally were working on behalf of people in a company where people haven’t been treated fairly,"" Schultz said. ""We do not believe that we are that kind of company. We do nothing nefarious. We put our people first.”That comment earned a rebuke from Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, who said $17 per hour is not a living wage.“Any large corporation shouldn't necessarily be bragging about $15 to $20 wages,” Braun said.But other Republicans defended Starbucks, saying it has created millions of jobs and is being demonized by Democrats to bolster their support from unions.Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, questioned why customers are willing to pay $6 for a Starbucks latte, and said his family is satisfied with Maxwell House. But Starbucks still deserves respect, he said.“The hearing today is convened to attack a private company for its success,"" Paul said.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, questioned Schultz's respect for employees, noting that the company has refused to add new benefits — like credit card tipping or wage increases — at stores that have unionized. Schultz countered that those benefits are subject to bargaining.Smith said labor organizers are seeking to address an imbalance of power within the company. Workers say Starbucks cuts their schedules with little notice, for example, making them ineligible for benefits.“You're a billionaire and they are your employees. The imbalance is extreme,” Smith said.Schultz angrily responded that repeatedly calling him a “billionaire” was unfair.“I grew up in federally subsidized housing. My parents never owned a home. Yes, I have billions of dollars. I earned it. No one gave it to me,” he said.Sanders had sought Schultz's testimony for months. Schultz had tried to sidestep the hearing, suggesting that others in the company were more deeply involved in labor matters.But Sanders argued that Schultz, who stepped down as interim CEO last week but remains on the company’s board, was instrumental in setting the company's policies. Schultz, who led Starbucks from 1987 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2017, returned as interim CEO last April.Sanders asked Schultz to commit to providing the union with contract proposals within 14 days. Schultz would not, but said Starbucks remains prepared to meet in-person for bargaining. The union has tried to hold some bargaining sessions over Zoom, which Starbucks has rejected.Starbucks' anti-union stance appears set to continue under the company's new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, who took over leadership of the company last week.“I continue to believe a direct relationship with our partners is the best way forward,” Narasimhan told The Associated Press last week.Still, the company could face some internal pressure to improve its labor relations. Late Wednesday, Starbucks said its shareholders had approved a measure calling for an independent assessment of the company's commitment to workers' rights. Fifty-two percent of those voting favored the measure.]"

Here are the pros and cons for your health",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-inspired-olive-oil-184456845.html,1680029096,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Stateside Starbucks fans, the company’s new olive-oil-infused Oleato drinks are finally available here. But is adding olive oil to your morning brew a good thing? It depends. While there are health benefits to both coffee and olive oil separately, combining the two may be a different story.What are Starbucks Oleato coffee drinks?The following Starbucks Oleato drinks are now available in select cities across the U.S., including Chicago, Seattle and New York:Starbucks Oleato Caffé LatteStarbucks Oleato Iced Shaken EspressoStarbucks Oleato Golden Foam Cold BrewThe new line was inspired after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s recent trip to Sicily where he first learned of the Mediterranean custom of taking a spoonful of olive oil each day. “I was absolutely stunned at the unique flavor and texture created when the Partanna extra virgin olive oil was infused into Starbucks coffee,” he said in a statement about the new line. “In both hot and cold coffee beverages, what it produced was an unexpected, velvety, buttery flavor that enhanced the coffee and lingers beautifully on the palate.”What is Oleato coffee?Oleato is inspired by the Latin word for “olive” and “an Italian word that nods to the process of infusing the olive oil with coffee,” according to Starbucks. The new line of beverages specifically include Partanna extra virgin olive oil, which is known for its vibrant and buttery flavor.“When you infuse Partanna extra virgin olive oil by steaming or shaking it with oat milk, it creates this luxurious, textural experience that’s similar to whole milk,” Amy Dilger, principal Starbucks beverage developer, said in a blog post about the new line.Is olive oil in coffee good for you?The health benefits of olive oil are well documented: It's rich in healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants that may reduce risk of chronic diseases. Olive oil also has anti-inflammatory properties that work similarly to ibuprofen. As olive oil is often found in Mediterranean diets, it’s also been proven to help reduce the risk of heart disease and lower blood pressure.Story continuesCoffee also boasts several perks, including boosting energy levels and reducing feelings of fatigue.Whether the olive oil and coffee combo offers extra health benefits depends on who you ask. Dr. Steven Gundry, cardiothoracic surgeon and founder of Gundry MD, a supplement and health product company, points out olive oil's high polyphenol content, which is associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.""One of the easiest daily ways to get polyphenols into your diet is to use cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil on everything, including taking a shot of EVOO every day,"" he says.Kara Burnstine, registered nutritionist and certified diabetes educator at Pritikin Longevity Center, takes the opposite stance. “It would not be my recommendation to add olive oil to coffee as the calories are quite high for a small amount of olive oil,” she says.“Olive oil, albeit a healthier oil, should still be used sparingly in the diet, so maybe save it for your salad and try adding fat-free milk, soy milk, or almond milk, unsweetened, as a lower-calorie dense option,” she continues.“Separately coffee and olive oil have shown to have heart health benefits; however putting them together does not add up to a healthy breakfast or added benefit,” shares Burnstine. “Some might say the fatted-up coffee can boost brain health and help keep you satisfied, but I'm still sticking to my oatmeal for my morning brain boost: a great combo of whole grains, fiber, and antioxidants.”How is Oleato coffee different from Bulletproof coffee?The coffee plus high quality fat combo may sound familiar. The once trendy Bulletproof coffee recipe contains coffee, unsalted butter, and a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), such as coconut oil.“Both of these fats [in Bulletproof coffee] are considered high in saturated fat, whereas olive oil is high in monounsaturated fat,” says Burnstine. “So similarly, these fats have about 120 calories per tablespoon, but certainly the saturated fats have been shown to increase mortality overall, whereas monounsaturated fats can have positive health benefits.”But unlike Dave Asprey, creator of the Bulletproof Diet, who said the drink is a high-energy, low-carb breakfast alternative, Starbucks is not making any such health claims surrounding the new Oleato coffee drinks.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Unionized baristas say the company has failed to negotiate in good faith by refusing to allow some members to participate via video calls.Schultz, credited with transforming Starbucks into a global coffee juggernaut, stepped down as CEO for the third time on March 20, handing the reins to Laxman Narasimhan, who has so far not said how he intends to handle the labor unrest.Under Schultz, the company boosted benefits in an effort to show it cares about its workers, who it calls ""partners.""Schultz plans to tout the coffee chain's employee stock purchase program, health insurance, sick leave, parental leave, pay and other benefits, according to his testimony.Many Wall Street analysts also see Starbucks as offering the most generous pay and benefits of its peers in the industry.However, some of the new benefits did not apply to unionized stores, which the NLRB has said violates labor laws - a point which could be raised during Wednesday's hearing.Story continuesDemocrats, who control the committee, dispute Starbucks' assertions that its wages and benefits are more generous than other retailers.In a report Monday, the committee said Starbucks raised its starting wage to $15 an hour years after Costco, Target and Best Buy.The report also found that Chipotle Mexican Grill provides ""far more generous and flexible"" coverage for college tuition programs.

(AP) — A faulty pipe that allowed water containing a radioactive isotope of hydrogen to leak at a Minnesota nuclear power plant has been repaired and the plant will return to service in the next week, a spokesman for the energy company said Tuesday.Meanwhile, a state agency said a fish kill that claimed at least 230 fish in the Mississippi River near Xcel Energy’s Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant was caused by a water temperature change resulting from the shutdown of the plant, not by any chemicals leaking into the river.The nuclear plant, about 38 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, was fully powered down around 7 a.m. Saturday to fix the leaky pipe discovered last week, Xcel Energy spokesman Theo Keith said.“Crews have already repaired the leak, which did not pose any risks to public health, safety, or the environment,” Keith said in an email. “The pipe was confirmed as the only source of the leak.”The plant will return to service “in the next week,” Keith said, but will temporarily close in mid-April for an annual maintenance project.In November, a leak was discovered that allowed 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water containing tritium to spill. There was a monthslong delay in announcing the initial leak that raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said there was never a public health threat.Xcel Energy officials and state regulators have said the water remained on the plant’s site and did not reach the Mississippi River.Tritium occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Last week, the new leak was found coming from a temporary repair to the original leak, the company said. Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said the new leak also posed no risk to the public or the environment.Story continuesThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the state health department have sampled groundwater wells and found “no evidence that the tritium has reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources,” the MPCA said.The MPCA announced the fish kill on Monday. A statement from the agency said that in normal operations, warm water from the plant enters the river and the fish get used to it.“The fish kill is unfortunate but not unexpected given the significant temperature change that can occur when warm water from the plant stops flowing to the river during a shutdown in operations,” the statement said.Fish found dead included bass, channel catfish, common carp, and one or more species of sucker fish.Tyler Abayare, who regularly fishes near the plant, said he has noticed dead fish near the plant in previous years, when the facility closes for maintenance in April. Then, the dead fish drift downstream to shallow water and decompose. He typically avoids fishing the area until July.“It just starts to stink and makes your eyes water,” Abayare said.___Jim Salter in O'Fallon, Missouri, contributed to this report.___This story has been corrected to show that 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium has stayed on the plant’s site and has not reached the Mississippi River.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Archer-Daniels-Midland with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Quickly Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown EPS by 48% per year, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Archer-Daniels-Midland achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 19% to US$102b.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$257m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Archer-Daniels-Midland To Your Watchlist?Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Synopsys’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Synopsys What's The Opportunity In Synopsys?The stock is currently trading at US$374 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 20% compared to my intrinsic value of $310.56. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Synopsys’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Synopsys look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Synopsys' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 80%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in SNPS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe SNPS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SNPS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for SNPS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.It can be quite valuable to consider what analysts expect for Synopsys from their most recent forecasts.

89,bfc1548a-0d6d-3f55-9cb3-14beccdf63e9,LUV,2023-03-29,Should U.S. airlines pay passengers for delays like the EU?,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-airlines-pay-passengers-delays-185236842.html,1680029556,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines spent the early part of 2023 trying to make good after a historic meltdown resulted in more than 16,700 canceled flights during the 2022 holidays. The airline reimbursed passengers for the cost of alternative travel arrangements and sent many travelers additional loyalty points.Southwest wasn’t legally required to. The U.S. has no federal laws mandating that airlines compensate passengers for delays. Airlines are only obligated to offer refund s if they cancel a flight and the passenger decides not to travel.That’s hardly the case in Europe. An EU regulation, commonly referred to as EU261, requires airlines to compensate travelers for cancellations, denied boarding or delays of two or more hours. It went into effect in 2005 and applies to most flights operated by airlines based in the 27 EU countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.As long as the flight wasn’t disrupted due to an “extraordinary circumstance” such as weather, passengers are entitled to compensation from 250 euros (about $260) to 600 euros (about $630), depending on the length of flight and delay. Some passengers are also entitled to free meals and accommodations.HAS EU261 ACTUALLY REDUCED DELAYS?Given the financial pressure to pay out passengers, it might seem airlines are incentivized to stay on schedule, but some studies show that it might not help with being on time at all. Even when it does, there might only be marginal improvements. A 2018 study from the European University Institute concluded flights regulated by EU261 are 5% more likely to arrive on time, resulting in an average arrival delay reduction per flight of just 3.9 minutes.NEW PROBLEMS INTRODUCED BY EU261Experts say EU261 has spawned new challenges. For one thing, the definition of “extraordinary circumstances” for delays (upon which airlines don’t have to pay out) remains unclear. After all, the point at which a storm morphs beyond manageable is debatable. The government also never established a consistent process to file claims, and many airlines make it difficult to do so.Story continuesFor airlines, there are also the added administrative costs of processing claims, as well as potentially more idle aircraft and schedule padding to help prevent delays. Some experts worry that financial pressure might compel staff to rush through or ignore potential issues, presenting unnecessary safety and technical risks.WHO LOSES AND WINS UNDER POLICIES LIKE EU261?LOSERS: AIRLINES (ESPECIALLY SMALL, REGIONAL ONES)Some experts suggest that regulations especially hurt small airlines that can’t afford to have spare aircraft on standby or software to handle the compensation claims. The fixed payout amounts to passengers can have an outsized impact on shorter routes or budget airfares.“Compensating 250 euros on a flight that costs 50 euros is clearly absurd,” said former Flybe CEO Christine Ourmières-Widener in a testimonial generated for a 2019 report published by the European Regions Airline Association. Flybe is a now-defunct British regional airline.MOSTLY WINNERS: PASSENGERSDelays can cost passengers via time, inconvenience and stress, and sometimes literal expenses like food and lodging. Government laws mandating compensation can alleviate that burden if passengers are willing to put in the time to file the paperwork.Raj Mahal, founder of PlanMoreTrips, an app that helps travelers find cheap airfares, was flying home to Barcelona after spending the 2022 winter holidays in Portugal. His TAP Air Portugal flight was delayed by three hours, which the airline blamed on weather (though Mahal says other flights were departing).Mahal filed a claim through TAP’s Self Service feature, but the airline initially offered him just half of what he felt he was entitled to. It wasn’t until after he fired off an angry tweet (which the airline responded to) that he felt he received fair compensation.The rate of passengers claiming compensation has increased, suggesting more people are getting money for their inconvenience. In 2018, 38% of eligible passengers claimed compensation, up from just 8% in 2011, according to a 2021 European Commission study.WINNERS: THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AGENCIESThat uptick in passengers claiming compensation is in part due to the proliferation of claims agencies, such as AirHelp. These third-party claims agencies help passengers navigate the claims process, but often take a cut of compensation. For example, AirHelp typically takes a 35% cut of the traveler’s compensation.While companies such as AirHelp credibly threaten to sue airlines that don’t comply and help customers navigate the claims process, they also charge a fee to distressed passengers — in turn profiting off EU261.SHOULD THE U.S. ADOPT SIMILAR REGULATIONS?If the goal is financial incentives to increase on-time flights, U.S. airlines may already have that. Even without government-required compensation, delays cost airlines $8.3 billion in increased expenses, including crew, fuel and maintenance in 2019, according to the FAA Office of Aviation Policy and Plans.Ten major U.S. airlines have also made customer service commitments for flights canceled or delayed by three hours or more. That includes rebooking passengers and offering meal vouchers. Most promise hotel accommodations, too. However, none are required to do so by law.Southwest reported a revenue loss of $410 million during the 2022 fourth quarter, attributed to the December 2022 disruptions, which was just part of their $800 million overall loss. Factoring in the first quarter of 2023, the meltdown cost Southwest more than $1 billion after accounting for lost revenue and passenger reimbursements.“Southwest is being punished for this,” says Robert Poole, director of transportation policy for the Reason Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. “Anybody caught up in the 2022 snafu won’t want to take a chance on this airline again. Southwest lost business and market value. That’s more powerful than anything Congress can do.”Meanwhile, Mahal has successfully received compensation for shorter disruptions, such as a two-hour delay on an American Airlines flight last month between Austin and Albuquerque.He emailed American and — within 48 hours — the airline deposited 5,000 miles (worth about $75) into his AAdvantage account.Even still, Mahal, who is American but lives in Spain, says he prefers the EU’s clear passenger protections.“The current U.S. system is extremely broken and a joke,” he says. “There needs to be some basic passenger protection laws because the status quo isn’t working.”The Flight Compensation Regulation of the European Union has aided passengers in receiving more consistent compensation for delays. However, despite calls from advocates for the idea to be implemented in the United States, the regulation does not appear to be making waves.________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

LUV continues to grapple with rising expenses. Additionally, massive flight cancelations during the Christmas holiday weekend in December 2022 unfavorably impacted LUV’s fourth-quarter 2022 results.Let’s discuss these factors in detail.Escalating fuel prices represent a concern. In fourth-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 41.3% to $3.18. For first-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are expected between $3.25 and $3.35. For 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are estimated between $2.90 and $3.00. Higher fuel expenses weigh on the company's bottom line.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is likely to dent bottom-line growth. In fourth-quarter 2022, consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, increased 31% year over year. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 2-4% in the first quarter of 2023 from that reported in the comparable period of 2022. High capex may also play a spoilsport.Massive flight cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions during the Christmas holiday weekend in December 2022 unfavorably impacted LUV. The company had to cancel in excess of 16,700 flights between Dec 21 and Dec 31, 2022, due to the inclement weather. As a result, LUV had to bear a fourth-quarter 2022 pre-tax negative impact of almost $800 million (or $620 million on an after-tax basis), which led to a fourth-quarter 2022 net loss. LUV’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues were also unfavorably impacted by almost $410 million due to the flight cancellations in December 2022.Partly due to these headwinds, shares of Southwest Airlines have declined 33.5% over the past year compared with the 22% fall of the industry it belongs to.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Despite such tailwinds, continued recovery in air-travel demand (mainly on the leisure front) bodes well for Southwest Airlines. In the fourth quarter of 2022, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, increased 5.4% year over year to 31.30 billion.Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 83.5% from 81% in the year-ago quarter. Passenger revenue per available seat mile ascended 19% year over year to 14.78 cents. Anticipating the trend to continue, Southwest Airlines’ management expects first-quarter 2023 operating revenues to register 20-24% year-over-year growth.Currently, Southwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Investors interested in better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation – Airline industry can consider Copa Holdings, S.A.

See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, for US$8.0m worth of shares, at about US$100 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$92.60. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About TransDigm Group Insiders?An insider sold TransDigm Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. On the plus side, TransDigm Group makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for TransDigm Group (of which 2 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The problems present in the banking sector should be addressed, Nocera says, by bringing back the ""sensible regulations"" originally imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar.""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.Key Video Moments:00:00:25 Bring back the stress test00:00:36 Reimpose regulations from 200800:00:50 Problems could've been avoided if proper regulations had been in placeTo listen to our full conversation with Joe Nocera, click here.]"

MAT is benefiting from a strong product lineup, which includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations. However, supply-chain disruptions and inflationary pressures remain major concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversGiven a strong product line-up, which includes core brands, licensed brands and lucrative product associations, Mattel remains well positioned for growth. Owing to its popularity among young boys and girls, the company’s premier brand Hot Wheels has been the category leader in multiple product segments for several years. Continued strategic investments in the brand are likely to keep widening the depth of fun kids can have with Hot Wheels.Strong performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Hot Wheels continues to impress investors. In 2018, worldwide gross sales for Hot Wheels were up 9% and reached the highest annual sales in its 50-year history. In 2020, worldwide gross sales at the Hot Wheels brand increased 3% on a reported basis and 5% at constant currency (cc). During 2022, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 8% (on a reported basis) and 13% (at cc) year over year. The company is witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects.Through its current cost-saving program, Mattel remains focused on achieving cumulative cost savings, thus, enhancing margins. Basically, the company is simplifying its organization structure, optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations. Meanwhile, the company is focused on strong cost and productivity initiatives to support growth, operate more efficiently and rebuild margins. Going forward, Mattel anticipates the program along with the integration of the Capital Light Program to deliver incremental savings of $80 million to $90 million in 2022 and additional savings of $300 million by 2023.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesConcernsDuring the fourth quarter, cost inflation had a negative impact on the company’s operations due to a rise in raw materials’ price. During the quarter under review, adjusted gross margin contracted 620 basis points year over year to 43% due to inventory management initiatives, which includes higher close-out sales as well as inventory obsolescence expense, higher input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher royalty costs. The challenging environment is likely to persist for some time.For 2023, the company anticipates flat net sales in comparison with 2022 at cc. Adjusted gross margin for 2023 is expected at nearly 47% compared with 45.9% reported in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 is expected to be in the range of $900-$950 million compared with $968 million reported in the prior year.  Capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be in the range of $175-$200 million compared with $187 million reported in 2022. The company anticipates 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.10-$1.20, down from $1.25 reported in 2022.So far this year, the company’s shares have declined 5.1% against the industry’s increase of 4.3%.Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Las Vegas Sands Corp.

AVTR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 and operational workflow also looks promising. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and foreign exchange fluctuations are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 39.3% compared with the 30% decline of the industry and 15.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of mission-critical products and services has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion. The company projects 12.8% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Avantor surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.9%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Operational Workflow: We are optimistic about Avantor’s more than 200 facilities strategically located worldwide, including manufacturing, distribution, service, research &amp; technology and sales centers.

Strength in Avantor’s end markets was also witnessed.

The continued demand for Avantor’s Ritter and Masterflex products also augurs well. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: Avantor faces competition across its products and the markets in which it operates. The company competes on various fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies providing similar offerings.

The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its tactical approaches to accelerate growth also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and a soft volume environment are major downsides.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% compared with the 23.6% decline of the industry and the 15.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.52 billion. The company projects 1.8% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 7.01%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.Q4 Upsides: Quest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenues. During the reported quarter, the base business registered growth and the company also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In advanced diagnostics, the company generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services and launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test.To help offset inflationary pressures, it has continued to pursue its operational excellence strategy and has been closely managing the cost structure through the company’s invigorate initiatives.Base Volume Improves: Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business refers to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. During the reported quarter, base business revenue was up 8.9%. The company is increasing efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in the base business. The company continued to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. In the fourth quarter, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts within health plans. The company started benefiting from incentives related to these value-based contracts, which helped demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its tactical approaches to accelerate growth, the first part of its two-point strategy, raising our optimism. In terms of growth through M&amp;A, the company has announced an outreach lab purchase from Ohio-based Summa Health. Quest Diagnostics has also announced a professional lab services relationship with Southwest Florida-based Lee Health to provide supply-chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee Health and selected outpatient centers.To accelerate growth through health plan access, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts, where it sees higher growth than traditional contracts.DownsidesStiff Competition: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Soft Volume Environment: Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 5.1% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 2.6% north to $8.68.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $8.96 billion, suggesting a 9.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

This has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 2.9% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.07% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Netflix as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 18, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Netflix to post earnings of $2.81 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 20.4%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $8.18 billion, up 3.92% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.27 per share and revenue of $34.27 billion.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Phillips 66 belongs, has lost 6.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $3.73 per share, indicating a change of +182.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.68 points to a change of -16.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.8%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.44 indicates a change of -14.3% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Phillips 66 is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate of $35.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.5%. The $144.79 billion and $130.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.6% and -10%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $40.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.9%. EPS of $4 for the same period compares with $2.94 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +19.26%. The EPS surprise was -7.83%.Over the last four quarters, Phillips 66 surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-5-2m-worth-110132642.html,1680087692,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Even though Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock gained 3.8% last week, insiders who sold US$5.2m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$246, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$238. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Amgen insiders own about US$199m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Amgen Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Amgen shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Amgen, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Amgen you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(Triple Flag) on the open market for $179 million in net proceeds, after tax. The monetization of Triple Flag’s shares further streamlines and optimizes Newmont’s equity portfolio, while generating cash for the business at fair value.Since the completion of the Goldcorp acquisition in 2019, Newmont has received more than $2 billion in cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets as part of its strategy to maximize value for shareholders and other stakeholders. These proceeds further strengthen Newmont’s investment-grade balance sheet, enabling the Company to maintain a flexible financial position throughout the commodity price cycle with a clear focus on maintaining a world-class portfolio of long-life, responsibly managed assets located in top-tier jurisdictions.Newmont’s equity interest in Triple Flag originated through the formation of a strategic partnership with Maverix Metals Inc. (Maverix) in 2018. Following the Goldcorp acquisition, Newmont sold additional royalties to Maverix in 2020, which resulted in Newmont owning 42.0 million common shares of Maverix and 5.0 million purchase warrants. In January 2023, Triple Flag completed the acquisition of Maverix, and Newmont received 15.1 million common shares and 1.8 million purchase warrants of the combined company. Prior to the completion of the sale, Newmont held approximately 7.5 percent of the issued and outstanding common shares of Triple Flag for investment purposes.Cautionary Statement:This release may contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws.

The firm allegedly involved, Euronav, said Wednesday it will “take appropriate action when necessary.""Satellite photos and maritime tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put the Belgian-flagged crude oil tanker Oceania just next to the Vietnamese-flagged tanker Abyss for a possible ship-to-ship transfer. The group United Against Nuclear Iran has warned the Oceania's owner, the Antwerp-based Euronav, that it believes the Abyss took on Iranian crude oil in late February.The suspicion comes as Iran remains able to trade its crude oil at sea despite American sanctions snapping back into place after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Now, nearly five years later, Iran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels while continuing to sell its oil and supplying bomb-carrying drones to Russia to fuel Moscow's war on Ukraine.Brian Gallagher, a spokesman for Euronav, told the AP in a statement that the company “has and always has taken all the appropriate measures and protocols to ensure we are in compliance with all regulations.”“All cargoes within our system have passed these requirements,” Gallagher wrote. “Euronav will continue to monitor any specific shipments and take appropriate action where necessary.”Gallagher said the Oceania was a storage vessel and the cargo from the Abyss was for “a third party NOT directly with Euronav.” He added if the allegation the oil is Iranian is proven, “the cargo will be returned to the third party who delivered it.”Euronav trades on the New York Stock Exchange.The U.S. Treasury declined to immediately comment. The Abyss' manager did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Story continuesSatellite images from Planet Labs PBC and data from the ships' Automatic Identification System trackers put the vessels on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia. In an image on Tuesday, tug boats were pushing the Abyss toward the Oceania.Tracking data from MarineTraffic.com showed the vessels alongside each other on Wednesday. At sea, oil tankers can funnel crude between each other in a ship-to-ship transfer that typically sees boats in a similar position.In a letter dated Tuesday to Euronav, United Against Nuclear Iran said it believed the Abyss took on crude oil at the Iranian port of Bandar Mashahr, some 600 kilometer (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran, on the Persian Gulf. The Abyss had turned off its AIS tracker on Feb. 18 as it was pointed toward Bandar Mashahr.Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on for safety reason, but vessels believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements over the international sanctions Tehran faces.A ship corresponding to the Abyss' size and features could be seen docked at Bandar Mashahr on Feb. 22 in a satellite photo analyzed by the AP. United Against Nuclear Iran said it found a satellite image it believed showed the Abyss at the port in the same position the day before.“Any other signs of manipulating AIS transponders should be considered red flags for potential illicit activity,” the New York-based group said in its letter signed by Mark Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.The Abyss is managed by Ho Chi Minh City-based PetroVietnam Transportation. Vietnamese vessels have been suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil in the past. Smugglers typically misidentify where the crude oil they carry came from in order to skirt suspicions.Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is not the first time a U.S.-linked firm has been associated with an Iranian oil transfer at sea. In February 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran warned Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management that it believed a tanker the firm owned took on Iranian crude oil.The U.S. government has said illicit Iranian oil revenue funds the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, an expeditionary unit believed to be working abroad in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to back Iranian-allied militias.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.]"

128,add0f5ff-f38d-3460-8f28-9fc46e43d4df,M,2023-03-29,Petrobras (PBR) to Boost Oil Production Amid Climate Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-pbr-boost-oil-production-103310019.html,1680085990,STORY,['M'],"[Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras (PBR) has been in the news recently for its bold decision to ramp up oil production despite pressure from climate change activists and rising concerns over the future of the oil industry. The CEO of Brazil's state-owned oil company, Jean Paul Prates, believes that they should continue to increase fossil fuel production for several decades despite the global energy transition.According to a recent report, Petrobras plans to increase its oil production to 2.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2025, up from the current level of 2.2 mb/d. This move has raised eyebrows among environmentalists, who have been calling for a reduction in fossil fuel production to combat climate change.Petrobras, however, seems unfazed by these concerns and has vowed to continue investing in oil exploration and production. In fact, the company has been actively seeking new oil fields in Brazil and abroad, including Africa and the Gulf of Mexico.The global oil industry has been going through a rough patch in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in oil demand, as travel and transportation were restricted. As a result, oil prices fell, forcing many oil companies to halt production and lay off workers.Furthermore, the world is shifting toward renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydropower. Governments around the world are also implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. These trends have led to a decline in demand for oil and an increase in demand for alternative energy sources.Brazil is expected to produce 3.4 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2023, with further growth projected until 2030. However, investments will be necessary in order to maintain these levels.Why is Petrobras so Bent on Increasing Oil Production?One reason could be the sheer size of Petrobras and its significant role in the Brazilian economy. The company contributes around 10% to Brazil's GDP and has more than 45,000 employees. Any significant reduction in oil production could have a severe impact on the country's economy and its people.Story continuesAnother reason could be the current state of the oil industry that was affected by low prices and falling demand during the pandemic. Many smaller oil companies were forced to reduce production or even shut down entirely. However, Petrobras, with its size and resources, managed to weather the storm and emerge stronger.The company’s strategy is not without risks. It could face significant backlash from environmental groups and investors who are increasingly demanding a shift toward clean energy. Additionally, the future of the oil industry is uncertain, and Petrobras could find itself struggling if the demand for fossil fuels continues to decline.Despite the challenges, PBR still believes that there will be a demand for oil in the future. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.5% until 2026. However, the growth rate is expected to slow down after 2026, due to the increasing use of electric vehicles and the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies.In conclusion, Petrobras' decision to ramp up oil production amid increasing pressure from environmentalists and the uncertain future of the oil industry is a bold move. Let us wait and see if this move pays off in the long run.Petrobras, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, is a globally renowned Brazilian oil and gas company. It engages in various energy-related activities such as oil exploration, production, refining, trading, and transportation of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Petrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Secure your seat todayBitcoin (BTC) has begun 2023 with a bang, marking a positive turnaround from a year-long swoon.The leading cryptocurrency by market value has added almost 72% to $28,500 this year, its best quarterly gain in two years, CoinDesk data shows. The rally has lifted the cryptocurrency's market value to $542 billion.Just three months ago, some experts were mulling the possibility of bitcoin falling to as low as $12,000 this quarter, after its valuation had declined by 76% since November 2021.The rebound has put bitcoin ahead of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, which appears on track for a 50% quarterly gain. Gold has added over 7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has rallied 15%.Much of the rebound has been fueled by speculation that central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, will abandon their aggressive rate increases in response to recession signals.The so-called Fed pivot expectations strengthened early this month after three U.S. banks collapsed and the central bank launched emergency funding programs to arrest panic in the banking sector. The central bank's balance sheet has recently expanded by $300 billion, undoing months of quantitative tightening. According to fed-funds futures, traders now see the Fed beginning an easing cycle in June with a rate cut of a quarter percentage point.""It's all about expectations of new easing measures by central banks, especially the Fed,"" Martin Leinweber, digital-assets product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, told CoinDesk TV. ""Among all risk assets, bitcoin stands out as being the most sensitive to liquidity swings.""David Foley, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, said assets with sound money appeal, like bitcoin and gold, are benefitting from the liquidity injections.""With the Fed suddenly turning on a dime, having to throw some QE back into the system to protect the banking system, money flows into sound money assets: gold, silver. And bitcoin being sound money is going to be the fastest in the race,"" Foley said on CoinDesk TV, referring to quantitative easing.Story continuesSome observers say bitcoin's worsening order book depth has played a bigger role in the price surge.Order book depth refers to how easy or difficult it is to get in and out of large trades at stable prices. The depth has steadily dwindled since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and reached a 10-month low early this month. In other words, a small buy order now has a bigger bullish impact on prices.""In this instance, the narrative of bitcoin as a hedge against financial calamity gave BTC the push it needed. But there was little upside resistance to hurdle over,"" Conor Ryder, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, wrote in a recently published analytics piece.]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Baker Hughes Company BKR, EOG Resources EOG and Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:OverviewBased in Las Vegas, NV, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Wynn Resorts was founded in 2002. The company, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts. The company currently owns and operates casino hotel resort properties in Las Vegas, and in Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.Strong Growth TrajectoryWynn Resorts, one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry, is well poised to grow strategically. Given its strong brand name, Wynn Resorts is better positioned to command a premium rate relative to its peers in the gaming and lodging industry. Moreover, the addition of Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts, makes it an initiative placed in the right direction. The company reconfigured its casino and changed the casino loyalty program. Also, it emphasized on adding incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. With group business returning back, the initiatives are likely to benefit the company in the upcoming periods. The company stated that it would upgrade Encore Boston Harbor to be the top-performing Casino in the northeast.Sports Betting to Drive GrowthThe company is focusing on sport betting expansion to drive growth. In an effort to focus on online betting, the company announced the merger of Wynn Interactive into Austerlitz Acquisition Corp. To drive growth the company will invest $640 million. Meanwhile, WynnBET sports betting and online casino applications were operational in New Jersey for quite some time. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company launched WynnBET online sports and casino offerings in Colorado and Michigan. It also secured market access in Arizona, New York, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio and received conditional licensing in Tennessee.Story continuesFundamentalsZacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that Wynn Resorts is on track to fully recover from the COVID-19-induced earnings slow down by 2025. Prior to the shock of the pandemic, WYNN shares were trading at $200 per share. Should Wynn meet or exceed analyst expectations in the next two years, we expect its price to double and regain old, pre-pandemic levels.Technical ViewShares of Wynn are pulling into the 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out. The first tag of the 50-day moving average tends to be a favorable area from a reward-to-risk perspective.Bottom LineWynn Resorts is firing on all cylinders and investors are currently being offered an opportunity to take advantage of a temporary market shock (the pandemic). Expect WYNN shares to outperform as the company takes advantage of growth drivers such as sports betting, Macau, and strong brand recognition.Bear of the Day:OverviewZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock BioNTech is a German biotech firm that develops and commercializes immunotherapies and innovative cancer treatments based on individualized therapies and precision medicine. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Mainz, Germany.BioNTech was relatively obscure until the company partnered with pharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer to develop one of the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine, called the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, has been authorized for emergency use in numerous countries around the world.Fundamental ViewThe COVID-19 pandemic was a windfall opportunity for BioNTech and other mRNA vaccine manufacturers. In the heat of the pandemic, BNTX’s EPS grew from zero to nearly $16 per share.The stock reacted accordingly, rising from $12 to over $400 a share in just months. However, unfortunately for BNTX investors, equities tend to be forward-looking devices rather than backward looking mechanisms. From that perspective, the picture is less rosy. This year, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that BNTX’s earnings will dive 70% year-over-year.What’s worse is that recent revisions are moving in the wrong direction. Over the past 90 days, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates have dropped precipitously.Technical ViewSometimes, it's important to focus on how a stock reacts to earnings, rather than the earnings themselves. Over the past two quarters, BNTX has beat consensus analyst estimates. However, shares are lagging and trading near multi-year lows.Relatively speaking, BNTX is -25% over the past twelve months while the S&amp;P 500 is only -14%.Bottom LineBNTX is ranked a lowly 5 for a reason. Earnings have peaked, COVID hysteria has subsided, and the technical picture is lagging. All else being equal, expect BNTX shares to underperform over the next year.Additional content:Permian Oil Rig Count Increases 2 Straight WeeksIn its weekly release, Baker Hughes Company stated that the U.S. rig count was higher than the prior-week tally. The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Rises: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 758 for the week ended Mar 24. The figure is higher than the prior week’s count of 754. Thus, the tally rose for two straight weeks. The current national rig count is also higher than the year-ago level of 670.The onshore rigs in the week ended Mar 24 totaled 739, higher than the prior week's count of 736. In offshore resources, 18 rigs were operating, higher than the prior week’s count of 17.U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises: The oil rig count was 593 in the week ended Mar 24, higher than the prior-week figure of 589. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is also up from the year-ago figure of 531.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Flat: Natural gas rig count of 162 is the same as the prior-week figure. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 137. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 89.9% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 16 units, higher than the prior-week count of 15 units. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 742 is higher than the prior-week level of 739.Gulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Rises: GoM rig count was 17 units, all oil-directed. The count was higher than the prior-week number of 16.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 348, higher than the prior week's count of 345. Thus, the number increased for two straight weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $65-per-barrel mark, which continues to be highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Handsome oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources and Diamondback Energy, Inc., as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned a handsome amount of cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Diamondback Energy is a leading pure-play Permian operator. FANG has expanded its footprint in the Midland basin since it acquired all leasehold interest and associated properties of Lario Permian, LLC – a wholly owned affiliate of Lario Oil &amp; Gas Company. FANG, with a Zacks Rank of 3, also has an investment-grade balance sheet.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Data released today for January 2023 show that the trend of declining home price gains continued across the United States with declining prices reported in the San Francisco, San Diego, Portland, and Seattle markets. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 3.8% annual gain in January, down from 5.6% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite annual increase came in at 2.5%, down from 4.4% in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a 2.5% year-over-year gain, down from 4.6% in the previous month.Miami, Tampa, and Atlanta again reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in January. Miami led the way with a 13.8% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 10.5% increase, and Atlanta in third with an 8.4% increase. All 20 cities reported lower prices in the year ending January 2023 versus the year ending December 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -0.5% month-over-month decrease in January, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -0.5% and -0.6%, respectively.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.2%, while both the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -0.4%.In January, before seasonal adjustment, 19 cities reported declines with only Miami reporting an increase at 0.1%. After seasonal adjustment, 15 cities reported declines while Miami, Boston, Charlotte, and Cleveland had slight increases.Story continuesANALYSIS""2023 began as 2022 had ended, with U.S. home prices falling for the seventh consecutive month,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""The National Composite declined by 0.5% in January, and now stands 5.1% below its peak in June 2022. On a trailing 12-month basis, the National Composite is only 3.8% ahead of its level in January 2022, a result also reflected in our 10- and 20-City Composites (both +2.5% year-over-year).""January's market weakness was broadly based. Before seasonal adjustment, 19 cities registered a decline; the seasonally adjusted picture is a bit brighter, with only 15 cities declining. With or without seasonal adjustment, most cities' January declines were less severe than their December counterparts.""Miami (+13.8% year-over-year) was the best performing city in January, extending its winning streak to six consecutive months. Tampa (+10.5%) and Atlanta (+8.4%) continued in second and third place, with Charlotte (+8.1%) not far behind. At the other end of the scale, one of the most interesting aspects of January's report is the continued weakness in home prices on the West Coast, as San Diego and Portland joined San Francisco and Seattle in negative year-over-year territory. It's therefore unsurprising that the Southeast (+10.2%) continues as the country's strongest region, while the West (-1.5%) continues as the weakest.""Financial news this month has been dominated by ructions in the commercial banking industry, as some institutions' risk management functions proved unequal to the rising level of interest rates. Despite this, the Federal Reserve remains focused on its inflation-reduction targets, which suggest that rates may remain elevated in the near-term. Mortgage financing and the prospect of economic weakness are therefore likely to remain a headwind for housing prices for at least the next several months.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak(%)LevelFrom Trough(%)From Peak(%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %292.71118.4 %58.6 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %296.88121.4 %43.8 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %309.07111.0 %36.6 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for January 2023.

They are constructed to accurately track the price path of typical single-family homes located in each metropolitan area provided. Each index combines matched price pairs for thousands of individual houses from the available universe of arms-length sales data. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index tracks the value of single-family housing within the United States. The index is a composite of single-family home price indices for the nine U.S. Census divisions and is calculated quarterly. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 10-City Composite Home Price Index is a value-weighted average of the 10 original metro area indices.

The firm allegedly involved, Euronav, said Wednesday it will “take appropriate action when necessary.""Satellite photos and maritime tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put the Belgian-flagged crude oil tanker Oceania just next to the Vietnamese-flagged tanker Abyss for a possible ship-to-ship transfer. The group United Against Nuclear Iran has warned the Oceania's owner, the Antwerp-based Euronav, that it believes the Abyss took on Iranian crude oil in late February.The suspicion comes as Iran remains able to trade its crude oil at sea despite American sanctions snapping back into place after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Now, nearly five years later, Iran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels while continuing to sell its oil and supplying bomb-carrying drones to Russia to fuel Moscow's war on Ukraine.Brian Gallagher, a spokesman for Euronav, told the AP in a statement that the company “has and always has taken all the appropriate measures and protocols to ensure we are in compliance with all regulations.”“All cargoes within our system have passed these requirements,” Gallagher wrote. “Euronav will continue to monitor any specific shipments and take appropriate action where necessary.”Gallagher said the Oceania was a storage vessel and the cargo from the Abyss was for “a third party NOT directly with Euronav.” He added if the allegation the oil is Iranian is proven, “the cargo will be returned to the third party who delivered it.”Euronav trades on the New York Stock Exchange.The U.S. Treasury declined to immediately comment. The Abyss' manager did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Story continuesSatellite images from Planet Labs PBC and data from the ships' Automatic Identification System trackers put the vessels on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Malacca Strait, one of the world's busiest waterways between Indonesia and Malaysia. In an image on Tuesday, tug boats were pushing the Abyss toward the Oceania.Tracking data from MarineTraffic.com showed the vessels alongside each other on Wednesday. At sea, oil tankers can funnel crude between each other in a ship-to-ship transfer that typically sees boats in a similar position.In a letter dated Tuesday to Euronav, United Against Nuclear Iran said it believed the Abyss took on crude oil at the Iranian port of Bandar Mashahr, some 600 kilometer (370 miles) southwest of the capital, Tehran, on the Persian Gulf. The Abyss had turned off its AIS tracker on Feb. 18 as it was pointed toward Bandar Mashahr.Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on for safety reason, but vessels believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements over the international sanctions Tehran faces.A ship corresponding to the Abyss' size and features could be seen docked at Bandar Mashahr on Feb. 22 in a satellite photo analyzed by the AP. United Against Nuclear Iran said it found a satellite image it believed showed the Abyss at the port in the same position the day before.“Any other signs of manipulating AIS transponders should be considered red flags for potential illicit activity,” the New York-based group said in its letter signed by Mark Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.The Abyss is managed by Ho Chi Minh City-based PetroVietnam Transportation. Vietnamese vessels have been suspected of smuggling Iranian crude oil in the past. Smugglers typically misidentify where the crude oil they carry came from in order to skirt suspicions.Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is not the first time a U.S.-linked firm has been associated with an Iranian oil transfer at sea. In February 2022, United Against Nuclear Iran warned Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management that it believed a tanker the firm owned took on Iranian crude oil.The U.S. government has said illicit Iranian oil revenue funds the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, an expeditionary unit believed to be working abroad in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to back Iranian-allied militias.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.]"

143,add0f5ff-f38d-3460-8f28-9fc46e43d4df,MA,2023-03-29,Petrobras (PBR) to Boost Oil Production Amid Climate Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-pbr-boost-oil-production-103310019.html,1680085990,STORY,"['PETR3.SA', 'CL=F', 'NG=F', 'PBR-A', 'HLX']","[Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras (PBR) has been in the news recently for its bold decision to ramp up oil production despite pressure from climate change activists and rising concerns over the future of the oil industry. The CEO of Brazil's state-owned oil company, Jean Paul Prates, believes that they should continue to increase fossil fuel production for several decades despite the global energy transition.According to a recent report, Petrobras plans to increase its oil production to 2.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2025, up from the current level of 2.2 mb/d. This move has raised eyebrows among environmentalists, who have been calling for a reduction in fossil fuel production to combat climate change.Petrobras, however, seems unfazed by these concerns and has vowed to continue investing in oil exploration and production. In fact, the company has been actively seeking new oil fields in Brazil and abroad, including Africa and the Gulf of Mexico.The global oil industry has been going through a rough patch in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in oil demand, as travel and transportation were restricted. As a result, oil prices fell, forcing many oil companies to halt production and lay off workers.Furthermore, the world is shifting toward renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and hydropower. Governments around the world are also implementing policies to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. These trends have led to a decline in demand for oil and an increase in demand for alternative energy sources.Brazil is expected to produce 3.4 million barrels of crude oil per day in 2023, with further growth projected until 2030. However, investments will be necessary in order to maintain these levels.Why is Petrobras so Bent on Increasing Oil Production?One reason could be the sheer size of Petrobras and its significant role in the Brazilian economy. The company contributes around 10% to Brazil's GDP and has more than 45,000 employees. Any significant reduction in oil production could have a severe impact on the country's economy and its people.Story continuesAnother reason could be the current state of the oil industry that was affected by low prices and falling demand during the pandemic. Many smaller oil companies were forced to reduce production or even shut down entirely. However, Petrobras, with its size and resources, managed to weather the storm and emerge stronger.The company’s strategy is not without risks. It could face significant backlash from environmental groups and investors who are increasingly demanding a shift toward clean energy. Additionally, the future of the oil industry is uncertain, and Petrobras could find itself struggling if the demand for fossil fuels continues to decline.Despite the challenges, PBR still believes that there will be a demand for oil in the future. According to the International Energy Agency, global oil demand is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 0.5% until 2026. However, the growth rate is expected to slow down after 2026, due to the increasing use of electric vehicles and the implementation of carbon emission reduction policies.In conclusion, Petrobras' decision to ramp up oil production amid increasing pressure from environmentalists and the uncertain future of the oil industry is a bold move. Let us wait and see if this move pays off in the long run.Petrobras, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, is a globally renowned Brazilian oil and gas company. It engages in various energy-related activities such as oil exploration, production, refining, trading, and transportation of oil, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, Petrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like NGL Energy Partners NGL, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Energy Transfer ET and Helix Energy Solutions Group HLX, each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Secure your seat todayBitcoin (BTC) has begun 2023 with a bang, marking a positive turnaround from a year-long swoon.The leading cryptocurrency by market value has added almost 72% to $28,500 this year, its best quarterly gain in two years, CoinDesk data shows. The rally has lifted the cryptocurrency's market value to $542 billion.Just three months ago, some experts were mulling the possibility of bitcoin falling to as low as $12,000 this quarter, after its valuation had declined by 76% since November 2021.The rebound has put bitcoin ahead of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, which appears on track for a 50% quarterly gain. Gold has added over 7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has rallied 15%.Much of the rebound has been fueled by speculation that central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, will abandon their aggressive rate increases in response to recession signals.The so-called Fed pivot expectations strengthened early this month after three U.S. banks collapsed and the central bank launched emergency funding programs to arrest panic in the banking sector. The central bank's balance sheet has recently expanded by $300 billion, undoing months of quantitative tightening. According to fed-funds futures, traders now see the Fed beginning an easing cycle in June with a rate cut of a quarter percentage point.""It's all about expectations of new easing measures by central banks, especially the Fed,"" Martin Leinweber, digital-assets product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, told CoinDesk TV. ""Among all risk assets, bitcoin stands out as being the most sensitive to liquidity swings.""David Foley, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, said assets with sound money appeal, like bitcoin and gold, are benefitting from the liquidity injections.""With the Fed suddenly turning on a dime, having to throw some QE back into the system to protect the banking system, money flows into sound money assets: gold, silver. And bitcoin being sound money is going to be the fastest in the race,"" Foley said on CoinDesk TV, referring to quantitative easing.Story continuesSome observers say bitcoin's worsening order book depth has played a bigger role in the price surge.Order book depth refers to how easy or difficult it is to get in and out of large trades at stable prices. The depth has steadily dwindled since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and reached a 10-month low early this month. In other words, a small buy order now has a bigger bullish impact on prices.""In this instance, the narrative of bitcoin as a hedge against financial calamity gave BTC the push it needed. But there was little upside resistance to hurdle over,"" Conor Ryder, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, wrote in a recently published analytics piece.]"

148,d5578410-22ac-35a4-a178-173f29218116,MA,2023-03-29,New California gas price law another defeat for oil industry,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-gas-price-law-another-235349574.html,1680047629,STORY,['CL=F'],"[SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — It was just a few weeks ago that California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the oil industry the second most powerful force on earth, trailing only Mother Nature in its ability to bend the elements — both physical and political — to its will.Yet on Tuesday, Newsom signed a new law that gives state regulators the power to penalize oil companies for making too much money, the first of its kind in the country. It's the type of legislation the oil industry might have crushed in the past. But on Monday, the bill cleared the state Assembly with only one Democrat voting against it.“We proved we could finally beat big oil,” Newsom said Tuesday after signing the bill.The bill is the latest in a string of defeats for the oil industry in California, a state many don't think of as a fossil fuel powerhouse. But for decades, California was one of the leading oil producers in the United States with a bustling industry that was a key part of the state's economy. The state is now the nation's seventh-largest oil producer, according to federal data.The oil industry doesn’t mind a David vs. Goliath comparison “as long as you think we’re David and not Goliath,” Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, said about the industry’s influence at the state Capitol. “Just look at the results the last couple of years on legislation.”Oil production has been steadily declining since the late 1980s from a combination of exhausting supplies and the state's changing policy priorities. A state law requires California to be carbon neutral by 2045, meaning the state would remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state's plan to do so would reduce demand for liquid petroleum by 94% by 2045.State regulators have banned the sale of most new gas-powered cars in California by 2035. And last year, the state Legislature approved a bill limiting where new oil wells can be drilled, providing buffer zones around homes, schools and other sensitive sites.Story continues“We're never going to get it right, in terms of this transition (away from oil), unless we minimize and mitigate the power and influence of big oil in this country,” said Newsom, now in his second term in office and widely seen as a potential presidential candidate beyond 2024. “They're the biggest impediment to a just transition.”While its influence in California might have diminished, the industry is still asserting itself. The Western States Petroleum Association spent $11.7 million lobbying lawmakers in the 2021-2022 legislative session, far more than any other single group. Chevron followed behind it, spending $8.6 million, according to state campaign finance filings. The next closest single spender was the California Teachers Association, at $7.1 million.Likewise, the industry spent millions on campaign contributions in the 2022 election, supporting both Democrats and Republicans. More than a quarter of all 120 seats in the Legislature are newly elected members.Those donations did not always translate to favorable votes. New Assemblymember Esmerelda Soria, a Democrat who represents parts of the Central Valley, was the top beneficiary of money from a Western States Petroleum Association-affiliated committee. Soria voted Monday to support the legislation despite industry opposition.The only Democrat to vote against the potential oil profits penalty was Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, whose district includes Kern County, home of the state's oil industry. Her vote appeared to irk the Newsom administration.Bains, a family medicine and addiction doctor who was first elected in November, tweeted a picture of the vote, saying: “Stand alone if you must, but always stand for truth.”Dana Williamson, Newsom’s chief of staff, replied: “Alone and confused you shall likely remain.”Bains said she voted against the bill because during the height of the gasoline price spike last summer, the Newsom administration and legislative leaders refused to suspend the state’s gas tax. They argued oil companies would not pass along the savings to drivers.“What’s to stop them from passing on the cost of this new tax with high prices at the pump?” Bains said. “That inconsistency is even more frustrating.”Though the industry couldn't stop the legislation, its presence could be felt in the final version, said Chris Micheli, a veteran California lobbyist who represents business clients but was not involved in the oil profits legislation. Newsom initially called for the Legislature to pass a new tax on oil company profits. Then he asked lawmakers to instead impose a penalty if oil company profits surpassed a certain threshold.Finally, Newsom and lawmakers agreed to let the California Energy Commission decide, punting the decision to a five-person panel appointed by Newsom with the consent of the state Senate. The bill also creates a new state agency with the power to monitor the petroleum markets, including requiring oil companies to disclose lots of data about their pricing.“The fact it took them three different substantive proposals to find something that would actually pass the Legislature I think goes to show the continued power and influence of the oil industry in this state,” Micheli said.Next year, the oil industry will be looking to exert its influence in another arena — public opinion. The industry is challenging a new state law that bans drilling new oil wells nearby homes, schools and other sensitive areas. Voters will decide in 2024 whether to uphold the law.“The partisan numbers of the two houses of the Legislature have dramatically changed,” Micheli said, referring to Democrats now having total control over state government. “The broader business community is going to have to go to the voters on some issues of public policy.”Newsom acknowledged Monday the importance of oil for the global economy, telling reporters: “I'm driving home tonight” and “I'm flying this weekend.”“Oil has built the American economy, built the industrial economy, I get it,"" Newsom said. “But we are transitioning. And all I'm asking for is don't rip us off anymore.”]"

This is because QUALCOMM’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of QUALCOMM look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of QUALCOMM, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -8.7%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, QCOM appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QCOM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on QCOM should the price fluctuate below its true value.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Novartis (NVS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.59 a share, just 28 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 25, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.59 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.58 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Novartis has an Earnings ESP of 0.79%.NVS is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Medtronic (MDT) as well.Medtronic is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 25, 2023. MDT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.56 a share 58 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic is $1.56, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.05%.Story continuesNVS and MDT's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

I’m upbeat about all of those technologies, and I advise investors to find tech stocks to buy that are each a play on at least two of these innovations.Certainly, AI-powered robotics are already changing the world, enabling new processes as diverse as self-driving cars, intelligent chatbots, and very impressive voice assistants. AI is also helping to revolutionize biotechnology and energy while combining with the internet of things to enhance cybersecurity and many industrial products.The following three companies utilize two of these technologies to deliver world-changing products and services. As a result, they are also great tech stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTech Stocks to Buy: Mobileye (MBLY)Transdev Mobileye (MBLY) autonomous driving shuttle bus showcased at the IAA Mobility 2021 motor show in Munich, GermanySource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comMobileye’s (NASDAQ:MBLY) Readbook system, powered by its Road Experience Management (REM) technology, “enables deployment of [autonomous vehicles] in new locations almost instantaneously,” MBLY reports. The company adds that high-tech “change detection algorithms,” sent by the “millions” of vehicles that utilize MBLY’s systems, allow Readbook to alter its maps almost immediately. That sounds like AI to me. Moreover, MBLY uses “faster computer processing,” given how quickly Readbook’s maps are changed.Additionally, Mobileye utilizes advanced AI to accelerate the “training” of its systems. The company used one of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI offerings to quickly create data and load it onto Mobileye’s system.According to Mobileye, its advanced technology allows it to update its maps faster and more easily than its competitors. Additionally, the company maintains that its maps are more accurate and adapt to the real needs of drivers better.Story continuesIt indicates that MBLY’s system works well and appeals to automakers. Its revenue jumped to $1.869 billion last year from $1.386 billion in 2021, while its EBITDA climbed to $61 million from $50 million.Schrodinger (SDGR)dollar sign written with pills spilled from a medicine bottle. Drug Stocks to WatchSource: ShutterstockSchrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR) explains that it combines “predictive physics-based methods” with AI to enable drugs to be developed much more quickly and cheaply. Additionally, it maintains that the drug candidates it identifies have a higher chance of being approved than those identified using existing methods.Using standard technology, researchers typically need “over 4-5 years” to identify a promising molecule that could become a successful drug. With its technology, SDGR could accomplish the task in just ten months.As I noted in a previous column, in the fourth quarter of 2022, SDGR’s top line jumped 23% versus the same period a year earlier, and the royalties it obtained from helping to discover drugs jumped 19% year-over-year to $9 million.During all of last year, SDGR’s “drug discovery revenue … jumped 84% to $45.4 million,” while the company predicts that its 2023 drug discovery revenue will come in between $70 million and $90 million.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT), a leading medical-device maker, has developed a robot that helps perform surgeries. Called Hugo, the product utilizes Medtronic’s Touch Surgery Enterprise and 3D visualization. MDT describes Touch Surgery Enterprise as “a first-of-its-kind AI-powered platform that makes sharing surgical video simple and provides surgeons with a powerful new training tool.”According to Fierce Electronics, when robots are utilized to assist with surgeries, patients’ outcomes tend to be better. Given that reality, I expect many hospitals to buy Medtronic’s Hugo system. The offering has been approved in Europe, Canada, and Japan, along with South America and parts of Asia. It is undergoing tests in the U.S. that should lead to FDA approval.The current leader in the robotic surgery market, Intuitive Surgical, generated revenue of $6.2 billion last year. I believe that Medtronic can take significant market share from ISRG, causing Medtronic’s financial results to improve greatly.Moreover, since robots only assist with 3% of surgeries now and AI and robotics are constantly improving, I expect the entire robotic surgery sector to greatly expand in the coming quarters and years.Trading with a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.4x, MDT stock’s valuation is quite attractive.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of SDGR  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy Now. On January 11, 2023, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which is the fund division of Goldman Sachs, disclosed that it raised $1.6 billion for its initial private equity fund that concentrates on investing in companies offering solutions to environmental and climate issues. The completion of the Horizon Environment &amp; Climate Solutions I fund happens as investors are increasingly focusing on companies that can aid in the global battle against climate change. Launched in 2021, the fund provides growth capital to firms that have progressed in creating solutions in areas such as clean energy, sustainable transportation, waste management, sustainable food and agriculture, and ecosystem services. Waste management is a rapidly growing industry. In 2020, the worldwide waste management market was valued at $1,612.0 billion, and it is projected to grow to $2,483.0 billion by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% from 2021 to 2030. Waste management pertains to the gathering, moving, and proper disposal of garbage, sewage, and other types of waste materials. It encompasses the treatment of solid waste and the safe and effective elimination of unwanted substances and products. Moreover, there is a growing trend of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) enabled devices like robots for the purpose of categorizing and separating waste materials resulting from demolitions and debris, and generating high-quality and valuable materials from mixed construction and demolition waste. This presents profitable growth prospects for significant industry players. In addition, significant investments in research and development efforts are anticipated to create a favorable market outlook.Some of the best waste management stocks to buy in order to benefit from the industry traction include Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), and Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN). Story continuesOur Methodology We chose the top waste management stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 11 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy NowOlaf Speier/Shutterstock.comBest Waste Management Stocks to Buy Now11. Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) is an American company that specializes in environmental solutions and technology. Its operations are divided into two segments – Treatment and Services. The Treatment segment provides a range of services, including the treatment and disposal of nuclear waste, low-level radioactive waste, mixed waste, hazardous waste, and non-hazardous waste. Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)’s fourth-quarter revenue was $16.757 million, which is slightly lower than the $17.116 million reported in the previous year. The CEO of the company, Mark Duff, acknowledged that the year 2022 was challenging due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused delays in projects in both the Treatment and Services Segments. However, he expressed optimism about Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)’s future growth prospects. He noted that the Treatment Segment had seen a gradual improvement in waste receipts, particularly in the last nine months of 2022, with average receipts per quarter steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 6 hedge funds were long Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI), compared to 4 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest position holder in the company. Like Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), and Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) is one of the best waste management stocks to watch. Here is what Long Cast Advisers has to say about Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“PESI is another stock that has been a drag on results for the quarter and year, despite the fact that it’s undergoing a remarkable turnaround partially masked by COVID related issues.The Treatment segment (left chart) is an asset-heavy processor of low-level nuclear waste – mostly derived from the cleanup of soils and machinery at closed federal facilities – at four locations in the US. This business makes money on the capacity utilization of its facilities; as long as the machines are running and the waste is flowing the business generates 15%-20% OpInc margins. The Services segment (right chart) does “boots on the ground” type work which it bids and conducts similar to a construction project, (though it’s more likely deconstruction). This segment was stagnant under prior management but has been rejuvenated under the current CEO Mark Duff, who joined the company in 2016 and was promoted in 2017.The large decline in Treatment mirrors the large COVID-related decline in waste shipments across the country. A data point that’s illustrative of the decline: At YTD 3Q19, ~760k cubic feet of waste was disposed of at a variety of federal facilities and cleanup sites nationwide. At YTD 3Q20, that dropped to ~380k cubic feet. (A keen observer of these links might notice significant growth at the Perma-Fix facility at TN, but that’s the result of an acquisition in Feb 2020 of a high volume low margin sorting facility.) As a result of declining waste shipments nationwide, margins in the normally stable Treatment segment have collapsed and ~$2M in quarterly operating profit has temporarily disappeared.The cumulative effect of the temporary decline on high margin Treatment concurrent with growth in lower margin Services makes it appear as if the company is experiencing decremental margins or “running to stay in place”, likely why the company gets no credit for the improvement at Services. At some point, Treatment will come back, growth in Services will be additive and I think shareholders will be rewarded.The stock trades for about 12x TTM EBITDA, slightly above the peer group, but this is against an EBITDA figure that’s understated by ~$3M due to the aforementioned temporary factors. Adjusting for these factors, it’s trading at 8x “normalized” EBITDA. When the environment re-normalizes, we should see the full benefit of the turnaround in Services + improved results in Treatment. None of this even remotely considers some of the large federal cleanup projects on which the company is actively bidding.”10. Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) provides waste management solutions for recycling, reusing, and disposing of various types of waste and recyclable materials throughout the United States. The company's services include disposal and recycling of different types of waste such as motor oil and automotive lubricants, oil filters, scrap tires, oily water, goods destruction, food waste, meat renderings, plastics, cardboard, metal, glass, construction debris, and a wide range of regulated and non-regulated solid, liquid, and gas wastes. It is one of the best waste management stocks to invest in. On April 18, EF Hutton analyst Chip Moore initiated coverage of Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) with a Buy rating and a $13 price target. Quest is a major provider of waste and recycling solutions across the United States, and according to the analyst, the company is distinct from its competitors due to its national footprint and asset-light approach. Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) is also able to handle a wide range of waste streams, making it a comprehensive solution for customers. Additionally, Moore noted that the company has developed valuable data warehousing capabilities, which allow it to offer full visibility of waste streams to its clients.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 8 hedge funds were bullish on Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC), compared to 9 funds in the earlier quarter. Nelson Obus’ Wynnefield Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $15.70 million. Here is what Long Cast Advisor specifically said about Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) borrowed heavily to purchase Rome RWS, Inc., and with results from the acquired company not yet fully on the income statement, the debt ratios expanded and equity valuations declined. Management – and really the Board – is undertaking a high skill maneuver of integrating its largest acquisition to date, carrying an unprecedented level of debt all concurrent with the long planned retirement of the long tenured CFO. It’s a little more exciting than necessary but the valuation is undemanding and the opportunity set quite large.Since I’ve long written about what this company could look like if it leaned more deeply into utilizing technology within its two-sided marketplace, I’ll be closely following the XPO Logistics (XPO) spinoff of the truck brokerage business, expected in 4Q22. Truck and waste brokerage share some similar dynamics and as I’ve long noted, the technologist at XPO worked at Oakleaf concurrently with QRHC CEO Ray Hatch. Technology was a big enabling factor at Oakleaf and in XPO’s +10x growth. I think it would have a similar function for QRHC were management to wisely invest time and resources in its development.”9. Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) is an environmental services company in the United States and internationally. The company operates in three segments – Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis, and Remediation and Reuse. It is one of the top waste management stocks to watch. On February 10, Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) revealed that it has acquired Environmental Alliance, which is an environmental engineering and consulting firm situated in the Mid-Atlantic region.On March 2, JPMorgan analyst Stephanie Yee downgraded Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) from Overweight to Neutral, and reduced its price target to $39 from $48. The analyst cited the company's Q4 results and guidance as being below expectations. Yee believes that Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) can achieve organic growth at a relatively high rate, but only when excluding the more volatile CTEH segment. However, the analyst noted that the company's operating leverage appears to be limited in the near term.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 8 hedge funds were bullish on Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG), with collective stakes worth $57 million. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 452,302 shares worth $20 million.Alger Weatherbie Specialized Growth Fund made the following comment about Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) offers various environmental services to a diverse client base, primarily in the U.S. The company has expertise in a wide variety of areas, including environmental assessment and permitting, measurement and analysis, and remediation and reuse. During the period, the company reported solid organic growth with particular strength in areas such as Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), biogas and GHG measurement. Moreover, management noted that they are not seeing a change in customer behavior or buying patterns despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company also noted that momentum continues to build in their favor on the regulatory front, with recent EPA proposals and state level regulations being introduced.”8. Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) caters to small and medium-sized customers in the industrial and vehicle maintenance sectors in North America. They offer services such as parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal, and used oil collection. In addition, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)’s Environmental Services division provides containerized waste management, industrial and field services, antifreeze recycling, emergency and spill response, wastewater vacuum, and parts cleaning.Kevin Steinke, an analyst at Barrington, increased the target price on Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) shares from $45 to $46 and maintained an Outperform rating on March 14. The company's Q4 2022 results surpassed expectations, with revenue rising by 42.2% year-over-year to $241.1 million, exceeding the firm's estimated $223.4 million and the consensus of $225.5 million. According to the analyst, the recent acquisition of Patriot Environmental Services, which was finalized on August 3, 2022, contributed 21.6 percentage points to growth. Consequently, the organic revenue growth for Q4 2022 was 20.6%.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 14 hedge funds were long Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI), compared to 19 funds in the last quarter. J. Carlo Cannell’s Cannell Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 800,137 shares worth approximately $26 million. Meridian Funds made the following comment about Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is an environmental services company focused on machine parts cleaning, used oil collection, oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services. Our rationale for investing in this company includes the recurring revenue stream it generates from its environmental services business unit and substantial growth opportunities in the re-refinery and used oil collection segments. Continued strong execution and higher oil prices contributed to the stock’s solid performance during the period. Notably, Heritage-Crystal Clean’s oil business segment generated record revenue in the second quarter and saw segment margins improve to 41%, as the spread between base oil sales and the cost of collecting used oil widened. The company’s core environmental services segment also recorded record quarterly revenue. We believe the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) story at Heritage remains underappreciated by the market as the company collects used motor oil and recycles it for reuse. We have high conviction in the long-term growth story for the company, but trimmed our position in the stock during the period as the share price appreciated.”7. Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) specializes in the recovery and recycling of lithium-ion batteries. The company offers a variety of cathode and anode battery materials, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt, as well as graphite, copper, and aluminum. Additionally, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) provides hub products like lithium carbonate, cobalt sulphate, nickel sulphate, and manganese carbonate. It is one of the best waste management stocks to invest in. On March 27, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY) revealed that it has formed a fresh partnership for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries and intends to establish a recycling facility in France. According to Baird analyst Ben Kallo, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY)’s Q4 results were below expectations and were negatively influenced by fair market value adjustments, resulting in a decrease in the firm's price target from $8 to $7. Despite this, black mass production exceeded previous estimates, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year. The analyst maintained a Neutral rating on the company's shares on January 31.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 14 hedge funds were long Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE:LICY), compared to 15 funds in the prior quarter. Zilvinas Mecelis’ Covalis Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 11.2 million shares worth $53.3 million. 6.

In addition to this, by having multiple businesses, companies can generate revenue from different sources, which stabilizes their revenue streams. This can be particularly beneficial in times of economic uncertainty or when one industry or sector is facing challenges. Through multiple businesses, these companies often have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow generation even during volatile times.After recording one of its worst performances in history last year, the stock market was on the road to recovery in 2023. However, the recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse has shaken investors’ confidence in the stock market. A monthly survey conducted by BofA through its self-compiled ‘Financial Market Risk Indicator’ after the fallout of SVB showed that investor worry levels have risen to 7.7, just a little below extreme highs of last year amid the Ukraine War. This financial instability has made investors explore different investment options, with dividend strategies gaining traction over other asset classes.According to analysts, companies with strong cash flow should be investors’ focus as they pay stable dividends to shareholders. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke with Barron’s about dividend stocks and the importance of cash flow. He said:“Many dividend payers have strong balance sheets and lower leverage, and the sustainability of the dividend isn’t in question unless we get a really deep downturn.”He further added that investors should avoid companies with a lot of debt and turn their attention toward those who are able to smoothly cover their payouts by free cash flow.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some companies that have raised their payouts for a long period of time and have strong cash flow generation. Companies like these can provide a reliable source of income and can also help to mitigate the effects of market volatility.

Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.As I have previously pointed out, our Fund has held Unilever shares since inception and was about the 12th largest shareholder when these events happened. Yet for the first eight years of our existence as a shareholder we did not hear from Unilever. The first contact was when we were asked to vote in favour of moving the headquarters and listing to the Netherlands. As I remarked at the time, it is not a good way to manage relationships to ignore people until you need their support…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Emerson Electric Co.

Think your friend or colleague should know about us? Forward this newsletter to them. They can also subscribe here.)By Nancy LapidMarch 28 (Reuters) -Hello Health Rounds Readers! Surgeons often remove cancer patients' lymph nodes to see if the disease has spread beyond the tumor, but modern cancer drugs that boost immune responses might work even better if lymph nodes are left in place, new research shows. We also highlight a study that suggests claims of cognitive benefits from exercise might have been exaggerated; and a U.S. study that found widely used drugs to prevent heart attacks and strokes are least likely to be prescribed to Black and Hispanic patients.Waiting to remove lymph nodes might boost cancer therapyThe effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy drugs might be improved if administered before a patient's lymph nodes are removed, new research suggests.Lymph nodes near a tumor are typically removed during surgery to determine whether cancer cells have spread to them. But the nodes contain tumor-fighting cells that could be activated by immunotherapy drugs, according to a report published in Cell.The most commonly used cancer immunotherapy drugs, known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, work by defeating defenses cancer uses to evade the immune response, allowing the drugs to reinvigorate ""exhausted"" responses of immune cells called T cells that recognize and kill cancer cells.The drugs - such as Merck &amp; Co's Keytruda, Opdivo and Yervoy from Bristol Meyers Squibb and Roche's Tecentriq - were thought to primarily impact T cells inside the tumor. But new research in mice and a small trial in humans shows the treatments also boost effectiveness of T cells stored in lymph nodes near the site of the cancer.""Removing lymph nodes with metastatic cancer cells is probably still important, but taking them out before immunotherapy treatment may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater,"" said study leader Matthew Spitzer of the Gladstone-UCSF Institute for Genomic Immunology in San Francisco.Story continuesA preoperative course of immunotherapy drugs ""could allow the responsive immune cells to become activated and enter the bloodstream before the lymph nodes are removed,"" he said.Spitzer surmised that the new findings may help explain studies that showed patients have a higher likelihood of benefiting from immunotherapy if given before surgery.""This study focused on patients with head and neck cancer, but we hypothesize that the findings will also be consistent in other kinds of cancer, which is something we are currently evaluating,"" he added.Exercise might not make you smarterRegular physical exercise has many health benefits, but sharper thinking skills probably isn't one of them, researchers reported on Monday in Nature Human Behavior. Previously reported effects of exercise on cognitive function may have been exaggerated, they said.The researchers re-analyzed data from 24 earlier studies that had in turn pooled data from more than 100 randomized controlled trials involving a total of more than 11,000 participants.After accounting for differences between those assigned to exercise programs or to control groups, they found what appeared to be small beneficial effects of exercise on cognition were no longer statistically significant.The findings do not rule out the possibility that exercise may have benefits for cognition in healthy people, but there is limited evidence to suggest that it does, the researchers said.Still, they added, the well-documented physical and social benefits of regular exercise are more than enough to justify public health policies promoting it in daily life.At-risk Blacks, Hispanics least likely to get statin drugsUse of statins for preventing a first stroke or heart problem due to clogged blood vessels is low across the board among at-risk U.S. adults but lowest in Blacks and Hispanics, survey results show.In a nationally representative sample of people with risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure and obesity, statin use was reported by 29.9% of whites, 15.4% of Hispanics and 20.0% of Blacks, researchers found.In the highest-risk participants - those with a 20% or higher risk of a cardiovascular event during the next 10 years - statins were being used by 37.6% of whites, 23.9% of Hispanics, and 23.8% of Blacks, according to a report in JAMA Cardiology.Use of statins by people of Asian descent was similar to that of whites, the authors said.The researchers reviewed data collected between 2013 and 2020 from 3,417 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Statins taken for high cholesterol, such as Lipitor and Crestor and generics, are among the world's most widely prescribed drugs.Reasons for the disparities likely include structural and interpersonal racism impacting healthcare system biases, neighborhood deprivation and pharmacy access, and insurance access and drug costs, said study leader Joshua Jacobs of the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City.""Also, trust (of healthcare and pharmaceuticals) may be playing a large role given the historical atrocities in medical research experienced by people of color,"" Jacobs added.""Patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease - especially Black and Hispanic adults – should talk to their healthcare providers about the potential for statin use,"" Jacobs said.(Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Additional reporting by Shawana Alleyne-Morris; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP DCP, The Williams Companies Inc WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk that indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well poised to gain and hence investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.Story continuesMPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to repurchase the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $30.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by January 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A aircraft mechanisms as ancillary equipment to support P-8A aircraft production.The work related to this deal will be carried out in Seattle, WA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. The company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a testament to that. Such order flows should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global defense aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft.

(NASDAQ:SWKS). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Skyworks Solutions’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Is Skyworks Solutions Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Skyworks Solutions is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $180.90, but it is currently trading at US$113 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Skyworks Solutions’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Skyworks Solutions?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 23% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Skyworks Solutions. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SWKS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SWKS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SWKS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $30.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by January 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A aircraft mechanisms as ancillary equipment to support P-8A aircraft production.The work related to this deal will be carried out in Seattle, WA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. The company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a testament to that. Such order flows should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global defense aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft.

Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations for its fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue, the world's largest athletic apparel company struggled with softer than expected sales in China during the holiday quarter.Third Fiscal QuarterFor the quarter that ended on February 28th, sales rose from last year’s $10.87 billion to $12.39 billion, easily topping the expected $11.47 billion. Net income rose from 1.4 billion, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier to $1.2 billion, or 79 cents per share, also exceeding the expected 55 cents. Selling and administrative expenses also rose 15% to $4 billion, largely as a consequence of wage-related expenses and direct-selling efforts.Bloated Inventory Continued To Weigh On MarginsAll retailers, including Nike, had one single wish during the holidays and that was to liquidate excess inventory that resulted from supply chain disruptions and changing consumer preferences due to inflationary pressures. Quarter over quarter, Nike offloaded about $400 million in inventories with inventories up 16% compared to last year’s period at $8.9 billion that has been attributed to product input costs and freight expenses rose.Over the last two quarters, Nike was relying on its partnerships with wholesalers to offload inventory with wholesale revenues rising12% in the quarter, following 19% growth during the previous quarter.As a result of higher markdowns and promotions, gross margin fell to 43.3%, which translates to a decrease of 3.3 percentage points.Sales In China Fell Short Of ExpectationsAlthough China is on road to recovery, the sales rebound didn’t happen at Nike’s third-biggest market by revenue. Despite the end of the country’s zero-Covid policy.Sales fell 8% during to $1.99 billion, while Street Account expected $2.09 billion.Story continuesWhen asked about its outlook on China’s recovery, Nike CEO John Donahoe said the company feels good about its momentum in the region with growth picking up the second month of the quarter after lockdowns ended.Other MarketsBesides China, all markets experienced double-digit sales increases. North America saw sales rise 27% while Europe, Middle East and Africa saw revenue expand 17% compared to last year’s comparable quarter, followed by a 10% sales rise in Asia Pacific and Latin America.GuidanceFiscal year revenue is expected to grow by high single digits, as opposed to mid-single digit guidance given in the prior quarter. Gross margins are expected to decline by 2.5 percentage points, which is the low end of the previously given guidance range that reflects the company’s ongoing efforts to get rid of bloated inventory. Full year expenses are now expected to rise 10%.In the undergoing quarter, Nike expects flat to low single digit revenue growth. CFO Matthew Friend said the company is taking a “cautious approach” to planning, given the uncertainty about consumer confidence and the economy, assuring that the company is well equipped to handle this high level of volatility.The DTC Bet Is Paying OffFor the last several years, Nike has been pushing direct-to-consumer sales and has invested heavily to build this channel by building out experiential stores, developing its loyalty program and growing its e-commerce efforts. Nike Direct sales were up 17% to $5.3 billion while Nike digital sales jumped 20%. Digital sales made up 27% of sales.Gender Neutral CollectionThis summer, Nike wll be releasing its first ever gender-neutral athletic wear collection this summer.

With a stigma grounded in outdated views about the industry being less important than fields of work, global footwear and apparel brand Timberland is dedicated to supporting the skilled trade profession. In addition to providing premium-quality footwear, apparel and accessories for working professionals through the dedicated Timberland PRO line, the brand is committed to supporting the industry through programs and initiatives aimed at closing the skilled trades gap.This past February, key wholesale account SafGard, in partnership with the workwear arm Timberland PRO, hosted a skilled trades career workshop in Greensboro, North Carolina to introduce middle school students to a career path they may have never considered before, while giving back to their local community. In collaboration with other brands and local nonprofits, middle school students and volunteers worked together to build, sand and seal picnic tables which were donated to local community organizations, while learning directly about the field from industry professionals. By collaborating with the local middle school, the event aimed to reach students who haven't already solidified their career plans to help them see that a career as a carpenter, welder, plumber or electrician is much needed and highly rewarding.""This event is about changing the societal perception of the skilled trades,"" said Ryan Murphy, Director of Brand Marketing for Timberland PRO. ""If we teach and show kids how crucial trade professions are, we can generate more interest.""Timberland PRO signed the Generation T pledge in 2019, committing to closing the American skilled trades gap by inspiring and empowering the next generation of skilled workers. By raising awareness and educating people about the industry and highlighting women working in the trades, Generation T wants to help develop a pipeline of talented skilled tradespeople who can build and strengthen the country's infrastructure. Through the brand's campaign, Always Do. Never Done, Timberland PRO destigmatizes the trades profession and features men and women working hard, while emphasizing the careers as a secure, rewarding and profitable career path.Story continuesThrough local programs and commitments, Timberland is helping to close the skilled trades career gap by introducing the career path to younger students and showcasing the industry in a positive light. As a viable career option that requires 1-2 years of trade school, the skilled trades often provide above average salaries to entice new workers. Timberland also collaborates with the Lowe's Foundation to help close the skilled trade gap by providing training, education, support and career opportunities to current and future workers and by introducing youth to a potential career path. With millions of job opportunities open, programs like these and brands like Timberland aim to help fill them.Timberland, Wednesday, March 29, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Timberland on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: TimberlandWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/timberlandEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: TimberlandView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746420/Timberland-Works-To-Close-the-Skilled-Trades-Gap]"

(NYSE:VFC), the owner of several prominent fashion brands, offered a very high dividend yield of 8.70% for a very short period of time, brought about by a steep drop in earnings and the share price before the company adjusted for the times and slashed the dividend. Now, the forward dividend yield is ""just"" 5.64%. Does this make the stock an attractive value opportunity?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with VFC. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Parnassus weighs inThe Parnassus Value Equity Fund (Trades, Portfolio)s fourth-quarter 2022 commentary provided a good summary on what's currently going on with VF Corp.:Shares suffered their worst annual performance in over 20 years due to company missteps amid heightened macro uncertainty. Management lowered their outlook three times in three months, as U.S. sales slowed with the end of stimulus payments, inflation waylaid European consumers and Chinese sales collapsed under Covid-19 lockdowns. Moreover, an inventory glut, unfavorable foreign exchange, and an impairment charge on the companys earlier purchase of streetwear brand Supreme all weighed on profitability, culminating in the retirement of the companys long-time CEO. We held our shares, encouraged by the companys efforts to revitalize Vans and by evidence that problems related to inventory, freight and inflation are beginning to abate.As we can see, the company, which claims to have the worlds leading portfolio of active lifestyle brands, has endured a lot of turbulence in the past few years.Originally known as Vanity Fair, VF Corp used to be the home to blue jeans and other basic clothing lines. But, in 2019, it bundled up those old reliables and spun them off as Kontoor Brands (NYSE:KTB). That left it with just the fashion lines, such as The North Face and Vans.Story continuesAs Parnassus noted, various headwinds emerged since then, which affect fashion (more expensive brands) more than active (staple) brands.Thus, it's no surprise to me that VF Corp. In addition, the market as a whole took a tumble in both 2020 and 2022. Combined, those effects dramatically reduced the share price and pushed up the dividend yield.Parnassus on VF Corp's Dividend Cut and OutlookVFC Data by GuruFocusShares hit a high of $99.96 on Dec. 27, 2019, before plunging. At the close of trading on March 27, 2023, the shares were trading at $20.84. In other words, the share price had fallen off by roughly 80%.Over the same period, VF Corp.'s debt rose by an average of almost 16% per year:Parnassus on VF Corp's Dividend Cut and OutlookCEO troublesWe dont know if he voluntarily resigned or was pushed out by disgruntled executives, but former Chairman and CEO Steve Rendle resigned on Dec. 5, 2022. Benno Dorer, the boards lead independent director, has taken over while the company seeks out a permanent replacement.Although he is only an interim CEO, Dorer has taken action (which may or may not have been planned while Rendle remained in office). According to Dorer:We are committed to improving execution through a sharpened focus on the biggest consumer opportunities and enhanced operational performance. Consistent with this objective, we are shifting resource priorities across the Company, including by reducing the dividend, exploring the sale of non-core assets, cutting costs and eliminating non-strategic spend, while enhancing the focus on the consumer through targeted investments.In terms of the dividend, this meant cutting the quarterly dividend by 41%, from $0.51 to $0.30. This 10-year chart shows the companys dividends per share to the end of 2022, but doesnt include the cut that has been made for the first quarter of 2023:Parnassus on VF Corp's Dividend Cut and OutlookThus, some investors may be misled by the trailing 12-month dividend yield of 8.7%, which is why it's always essential to look at the forward dividend yield and any recent company annoucements before making an assessment on the dividend prospects of a stock. The new annual payment will be $1.20 (4 x $0.30).Some commentators have lamented that VF Corp. lost the opportunity to become a Dividend King followoing its business split. Before the split, it had paid a dividend since the first quarter of 1985. However, the company felt the change was necessary for long-term growth.Looking forwardParnassus is cautiously optimistic about VF Corp.'s future, citing a revitalization of Vans, as well as indications its inventory, freight and inflation problems are beginning to abate.Ultimately, the long-term share price and dividend growth depend on the companys ability to get its earnings back on track. As this 10-year chart of earnings per share without non-recurring items shows, that could be a challenge:Parnassus on VF Corp's Dividend Cut and OutlookFor my part, I'm hesitant to make an assessment on the company until it gets a new CEO. In this kind of situation, a CEO can make or break a company.VF Corp. has a GuruFocus financial strength ranking of 4 out of 10, so it can't afford many more mistakes. GuruFocus gives it a profitability ranking of 6 out of 10 for good margins, but its growth has been nearly absent. Over the past three years, its revenue growth rate averaged 5.60%, while its Ebitda growth rate was 11.9% per year. Its earnings per share without non-recurring items growth rate over the past three years was 12.60%, but it was extremely volatile. This is reflected by the three-year free cash flow growth rate of -26.80%, which is a serious shortcoming since the company is loaded with debt and is unlikely to issue new shares at the current prices. The dividend cut will help shore up that aspect of its financials.Investors who like bargains, are willing to overlook the debt and are prepared to wait five to 10 years for a potential payoff may like this stock, but personally, I'll be steering clear of this uncertain situation. Stretching for that dividend yield just doesn't seem worth it.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
189,9a7f74da-73ad-3308-a5b1-b008be1e7203,VFC,2023-03-29,"At US$20.84, Is It Time To Put V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-20-84-time-put-144556233.html,1680014756,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$31.64 and falling to the lows of US$20.29. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether V.F's current trading price of US$20.84 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at V.F’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for V.F What's The Opportunity In V.F?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 2.27% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy V.F today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $20.38, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because V.F’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will V.F generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for V.F. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in VFC’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VFC, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Zions Bancorporation National Association, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Zions Bancorporation National Association?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Zions Bancorporation National Association. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Zions Bancorporation National Association, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Zions Bancorporation National Association is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. With 6.6% and 5.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Victory Capital Management Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Harris Simmons, the CEO has 0.8% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Zions Bancorporation National AssociationThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Zions Bancorporation, National Association. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Zions Bancorporation National Association. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

The problems present in the banking sector should be addressed, Nocera says, by bringing back the ""sensible regulations"" originally imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Specifically, Nocera mentioned bringing back the stress test for banks, originally introduced under the Dodd-Frank act. The stress test serves as a barometer of how well prepared a bank is to weather uncertain economic conditions. A covered institution must run stress tests on a regular basis, to prove they have sufficient capital to keep afloat under stressful circumstances. Under the Trump Administration, stress test requirements were relaxed significantly; the minimum threshold for banks was raised to $250 billion, and the frequency of tests was reduced across the sector. This allowed smaller banks - like SVB - to slide under the radar.""I think a lot of these problems could have been avoided"" had regulations been in place, Nocera says.Key Video Moments:00:00:25 Bring back the stress test00:00:36 Reimpose regulations from 200800:00:50 Problems could've been avoided if proper regulations had been in placeTo listen to our full conversation with Joe Nocera, click here.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.""The Initial Move Is Almost Always A Head Fake""On March 22, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, in-line with market consensus. On March 25, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on this move by the Fed and what he sees for the markets ahead. Cramer was expecting a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed, however, he thinks that the Fed ""was a bit more hawkish"" than he anticipated in light of the banking crisis. Cramer noted that though the Fed is suggesting moving interest rates higher than the current level, the Fed funds futures indicate 8 cuts by the back half of 2023.Cramer pointed out an interesting pattern that the markets have followed over the past year after every FOMC meeting since March 2022. Cramer thinks that this pattern can be insightful and can potentially guide the direction of the market in the near-term. Cramer noted that before the March 2022 rate hike, the intraday average movement of the S&amp;P 500 in either direction was 1.15%. He defined this as the baseline and pointed out that out of 9 times the Fed has raised interest rates, 7 times the S&amp;P 500 exhibited a bigger move than its intraday average. Cramer's analysis shows that the initial 3-day move of the markets, after the Fed's rate hike, reverses in the following 3 months. This has held true for 7 out of 8 times over the Fed's hiking cycle, that began in March 2022. Cramer thinks that ""the initial move is almost always a head fake"".While the pattern is noteworthy, Jim Cramer thinks that it is ""dangerous to predict we're going to rally over the next 3 months"", especially amid the banking crisis. The key takeaway for investors according to Cramer is that ""the initial reaction of the Fed's rate hikes has been wrong, every time, over the past year"".Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best cheap stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8.

Iranian activists call on social media companies to ban the country's leaders, IMF's managing director sees a risk of financial instability, and Pfizer chief corporate affairs officer Sally Susman remembers the moment she figured out how to ""break through"" to consumers during COVID in an excerpt from her new book. - Breaking through. I am not a yogi, but I do enjoy an occasional class, if only to be in sweaty proximity to the lithe and enlightened. Though an infrequent practitioner, I was saddened when, in late February 2020, my yoga studio closed due to COVID fears. On Sunday, March 1, I was on my living room floor, cross-legged on my mat, streaming a class on my smartphone. Instead of meditating, I was more engaged with the real world. My house was quiet, but my head was noisy.I had been unnerved by a call early that morning. “The streets of Beijing are empty,” Pfizer’s senior leader in our China division reported when we talked during the early hours. “I’m so grateful you called to check on me,” he continued. I heard desperation in the voice of a man I knew to be steady and stoic. The virus was recently identified as something I’d never heard of: SARS-CoV-2. It had just begun to demonstrate to scientists and researchers its ability to spread quickly from person to person at an alarming rate.Sally SusmanSomething was in the air aside from the chill, and I could feel it. I saw it when I stopped in at my bodega. The shelves were thinned out. No toilet paper. Bread and milk—the survival talismans of any crisis—were depleted. I thought about buying cigarettes, though I had quit 25 years ago. I felt the fight-or-flight impulse kick in. But where would I go?Home. I had to get home. But, with my wife away and my young adult daughter locked down in California, my house would be dark. I left the store empty-handed and scared.Mostly, I was contemplating the mission my company was pursuing. My boss, Pfizer’s chairman and CEO Albert Bourla, had just made a powerful pledge: to find a vaccine. I believed we would find the vaccine. I had to. The alternative was unthinkable.Story continuesThis mission—to develop and distribute a vaccine in record time—presented me with a rare opportunity to be part of a moonshot that could potentially save millions of lives. For me it presented the added possibility to repair the abysmal reputation of Big Pharma. This was urgent, not only for business reasons but because it was essential that we earn the trust of a skeptical public if we were to be recognized as legitimate contributors to the war against a virus that was not yet well understood.Imagine the compounded tragedy if we developed a safe and effective vaccine that no one had the confidence to take. We had to build back much of the trust the industry had lost. This was a communications challenge. And one I had prepared for my entire career. It wasn’t only the vaccine science that would be groundbreaking, but the intense engagement with the public as well. It is thanks to Albert’s singular vision and sturdy backbone that Pfizer found a highly effective and safe mRNA vaccine.This moment did not lend itself to the tried-and-true crisis communications exercises. I couldn’t rely on the basic playbook that every entry-level professional has been taught—the campaign plan that begins with an ambitious goal, a smart strategy of reliable and noncontroversial techniques along with an accompanying set of detailed supporting tactics. The COVID crisis was undermining public confidence, and consumers were already wary of pharmaceutical company communications. Too many advertisements showing happy people running through grass fields while a voiceover gives a long list of potential side effects had eroded our credibility. People wouldn’t accept a hackneyed approach when it came to injecting a new vaccine into their bodies and those of their loved ones. At least not without asking a lot of complex and valid questions.We needed something more powerful and less predictable if we were to succeed in creating confidence and trust in our work at a time of such justifiably profound anxiety. My communications, government relations, patient advocacy, and public affairs planning needed ambitions of equal magnitude to those our company was setting: a first-time vaccine technology to save the world. Nothing less would do, but there were few if any lessons from the past to serve as our guide.That is the moment it came to me.Between deep ujjayi breaths in yoga class, the idea of what was required of me was clear. “My intention is to break through,” I said. To cut through the noise and fear, we needed to shatter everything the public believed about Big Pharma. We had to challenge every assumption and respond respectfully to every criticism. We had to rethink the very essence of our public profile. We had to reintroduce ourselves.Reprinted by permission of Harvard Business Review Press.

Co-Founder Bill Gates. In a letter titled The Age of AI has Begun, recently published on his personal website, Gates laid out his vision for the future of AI and its potential impact on various industries.The billionaire expressed that he has only seen two technology demos that he considered revolutionary in his life. The first was in 1980 when he was introduced to the graphical user interface, which is now the basis for all modern operating systems. The second, Gates believes, was 42 years later in the form of OpenAI last year.OpenAI transformed the world almost instantly, even threatening the Google search engine monopoly due to its insightful, higher-quality results. Since then, hundreds of startups have surfaced to improve aspects of our everyday lives. Startups like Jasper AI raised a $125 million venture round shortly after ChatGPT's launch. And RAD AI cleared $3.2 million raised from retail investors for their AI marketing platform through their current Wefunder round.Workforce: Gates highlighted the transformative power of AI in the workforce, predicting that it could serve as a ""digital personal assistant"" to boost employee productivity. The tech magnate also noted that AI has the potential to revolutionize education within the next five to 10 years by delivering personalized content to students and identifying their individual motivations for learning.Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, Gates noted that AI could relieve healthcare workers of mundane tasks such as filing insurance claims, completing paperwork and drafting visit notes for doctors. Gates says the worst inequity in the world is in health, with millions of children younger than 5 dying every year. He argues that there is no better use of AI than to save children's lives, and he sees enormous potential for the technology to make a real difference in this area.Story continuesSee Next: Qnetic Unveils Revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage System to Accelerate Renewable Energy AdoptionClimate change: Gates covers the potential of AI to help mitigate the impacts of climate change in some of the world's poorest nations. IBM's partnership with NASA to use AI technology for climate change discoveries based on NASA’s scientific data could be a notable development in this field. IBM's investment in building Vela, its first AI supercomputer in the IBM Cloud, could prove to be a turning point in the company's AI development strategy and a potential growth driver for IBM investors.Education: Gates also sees AI as a powerful tool to revolutionize the education sector. Personalized learning, career planning and new tools for low-income students and schools to address the skills gap are among the areas where AI could make a marked impact.With the AI education industry set to reach $20 billion by 2027, tech firms are expected to make further forays into the space. One example is the language learning app Duolingo, which has over 60 million active users and has launched a subscription tier that incorporates OpenAI's GPT-4 technology. Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn notes that the new subscription tier, Duolingo Max, will provide subscribers with a more engaging way to learn by interacting with Duolingo characters and receiving personalized feedback on their mistakes.

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$350 and falling to the lows of US$298. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Waters' current trading price of US$300 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Waters’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Waters Is Waters Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Waters seems to be fairly priced at around 16.22% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Waters today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $257.73, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Waters’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of Waters look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 26% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Waters. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? WAT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WAT, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents per share.

Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 5% on 11% growth from pricing actions, somewhat offset by a 2% decline in volumes. The top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,545 million.The volume decline stemmed from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic, the exit of the Consumer business in Russia and a 3% decline from all other volumes and a product mix.MKC’s gross profit margin contracted 80 basis points due to escalated cost inflation and higher other supply-chain expenses. These were somewhat countered by cost savings from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) and Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) programs, along with pricing actions.The adjusted operating income was $227 million, in line with the year-ago quarter figure. At cc, the adjusted operating income rose 2%, backed by increased sales, partly negated by a gross margin decline.Segment DetailsConsumer: Sales went down 2% to $909.5 million, while cc sales increased 1% due to a 9% rise in pricing, somewhat offset by soft volumes. The volume decline included the adverse impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, reduced consumption in China due to the pandemic and the exit of Consumer the business in Russia.

For the three months ended Feb 28, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $103.4 million.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceMcCormick anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the GOE Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have a positive effect on the fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management anticipates currency movements to have a minimal impact on fiscal 2023 net sales, operating income and earnings per share (EPS).For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 9-11%. Management envisions the adjusted EPS in the band of $2.63-$2.68 in fiscal 2023.The company expects adjusted earnings in the band of $2.56-$2.61 per share in fiscal 2023, suggesting 1-3% growth. The bottom line is likely to be fueled by a solid operating performance, partly offset by increased interest expenses and a higher projected adjusted effective tax rate.This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has tumbled 11.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.4% decrease.Solid Consumer Staple PicksSome better-ranked consumer staple stocks are Post Holdings POST, General Mills GIS and Vital Farms VITL.Post Holdings, which operates as a consumer-packaged goods company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for McCormick: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for United Airlines Holdings, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.054 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$67b - US$20b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, United Airlines Holdings has an ROCE of 5.4%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 4.9%. See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for United Airlines Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for United Airlines Holdings.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at United Airlines Holdings doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 12%, but since then they've fallen to 5.4%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that United Airlines Holdings is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And there could be an opportunity here if other metrics look good too, because the stock has declined 39% in the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.United Airlines Holdings does have some risks, we noticed   2 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

WEST.4 Toxic Stocks You Should Eliminate from Your PortfolioThe ability to differentiate overhyped stocks from fairly priced ones makes investing foolproof. But in the complex marketplace, correctly priced stocks and over-bubble stocks are mingled in such a way that making a distinction between them becomes very difficult. Nevertheless, precisely pinpointing bloated toxic stocks on a regular basis and abandoning them at the right time is one of the secrets to a winning investment strategy.Toxic companies are usually vulnerable to external shocks and are characterized by high debt loads. The hype surrounding irrationally high-priced toxic stocks is usually short-lived as their current price exceeds the intrinsic value. These toxic stocks are bound to result in a loss for investors over time.Higher prices of toxic stocks can be ascribed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks. If you own such bloated stocks for a long period of time, you are bound to see huge erosion of wealth.However, if you can correctly pick such toxic stocks, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, just like identifying stocks with growth potential, pinpointing toxic stocks and discarding them at the right time is the key to guard your portfolio from big losses. CoStar Group, Definitive Healthcare Corp., Montauk Renewables Inc. and Westrock Coffee Co. are a few such toxic stocks.Here are four of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:CoStar Group is a provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States and the U.K. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSGP’s 2023 EPS has moved south by 7 cents over the past 30 days.

""By incorporating tri-fueled engines, we are ensuring that as alternative, low-carbon-based solutions become more viable, our ships will be ready to adapt and drive the industry forward to a more sustainable and net zero emissions future.""""With the launch of our Edge Series of ships in 2018, we set ambitious sustainability goals to make these ships the most energy efficient large vessels at sea,"" said Celebrity Cruises President and CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo. ""Working collaboratively with our partners, we have continued to develop new technologies and achieve breakthroughs with each subsequent ship.""To allow for the ship's fuel flexibility, Wärtsilä will deliver two converted 8-cylinder Wärtsilä 46F engines to allow them to utilize three fuel sources, including methanol. These changes not only advance carbon-free cruising, but by adding methanol as a fuel option, local emission like sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter are significantly reduced.Story continues""Wärtsilä has invested heavily into researching viable future carbon-neutral fuels for the marine industry, and methanol has emerged as one of the most promising candidates. This will be the second methanol-fueled engine conversion that we have undertaken, and the first with the Wärtsilä 46F engine. We share the commitment to decarbonize shipping, and the transparent partnership between our three companies for this newbuild project is a tremendous boost for achieving this aim,"" says Håkan Agnevall, President and CEO of Wärtsilä.""Development and integration of methanol systems on a cruise ship is a new challenge for Chantiers de l'Atlantique and, for the first time, is part of our decarbonization program,"" said Laurent Castaing, general manager, Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard.The order for the engines was included in Wärtsilä's order book in January 2023 and the full scope includes two 8-cylinder Wärtsilä 46F engines capable of operating with methanol as fuel, two 12-cylinder Wärtsilä 46F engines, and one Wärtsilä 32 engine. Wärtsilä will convert the 46F engines to run on methanol at the yard, prior to commissioning.With a sustainability journey that began over 30 years ago, Celebrity Cruises, along with its parent company, Royal Caribbean Group, has remained steadfast in its commitment to innovate, and advance, the solutions necessary for a better future.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Analog Devices with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Quickly Is Analog Devices Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Analog Devices' EPS has grown 27% each year, compound, over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Analog Devices shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Analog Devices' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Analog Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$93b company like Analog Devices. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$323m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Analog Devices Worth Keeping An Eye On?For growth investors, Analog Devices' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that you need to take into consideration.Although Analog Devices certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-130001039.html,1680008401,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has lost 1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 points to a change of +12.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.74 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The $32.24 billion and $35.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +10.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Snap-on Is Snap-on Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$930.9mUS$963.0mUS$929.0mUS$948.0mUS$974.0mUS$983.8mUS$996.8mUS$1.01bUS$1.03bUS$1.05bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 1.00%Est @ 1.32%Est @ 1.55%Est @ 1.70%Est @ 1.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$860US$822US$733US$691US$656US$613US$574US$538US$506US$476(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$7.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$14b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$239, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Snap-on as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.034. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Snap-onStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Machinery industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Snap-on, there are three essential factors you should consider:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Snap-on (1 shouldn't be ignored!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for SNA's future outlook?

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Colorado Springs include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Nearly half (47%) of people in Colorado Springs are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of 5G Ultra Wideband service as far north as Monument and as far south as Fountain.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity.  Verizon has 5G Ultra Wideband service using mmWave in the downtown, Briargate North, New Point Center, and Knob Hill areas.Colorado Springs’ exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Throughout Colorado Springs, Verizon engineers are using 100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Colorado Springs will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Colorado Springs. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Colorado Springs area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Today’s world calls for faster speeds, ultra secure connections and improved coverage in more places. We’re dedicated to bringing the best and latest technologies to local communities, and to keeping our customers connected through 5G,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Colorado Springs, CO customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers and visitors to Colorado Springs, CO having the best experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.   In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Colorado Springs, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in categories including accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls.  Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Colorado Springs with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 67% in the market and Verizon’s median upload speeds increasing by 10% since last year*.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Colorado Springs, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more.

This includes the rights of Tapestry's own employees as well as those of the workers who make our products. We develop and continue to nurture strong relationships with our supply chain partners through clearly defined standards and expectations, open communication and zero tolerance for human rights violations.WORKER EMPOWERMENT IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINOur 2025 goals include a commitment to provide 100,00 people working in the factories crafting our products access to empowerment programs by 2025.To help us reach this goal, we work with BSR's HERproject, a collaborative initiative that looks to empower low-income women in global supply chains through workplace-based programs. According to BSR, global supply chains are a major employer of women: Women represent an average of 68 percent of the garment workforce, 45 percent of the textile sector workforce, and up to 70 percent of the horticulture workforce. These low-income working women often face significant and specific challenges, such as a low status in the workplace, low skill levels, irregular and excessive hours, harassment, violence, and discrimination. These challenges are reinforced by a lower status in society. HERproject brings together global brands, factories and local NGOs to support programs on health, financial inclusion and gender equality. The initiative uses a data-driven approach to help understand and analyze the impact of its programs, including through baseline and end-line assessment surveys. Its forward-looking model uses a ""peer-to-peer methodology"" and by doing so, creates a platform for longevity.HERproject stands with women as they take greater control of their lives, ensuring that they can make and act on choices they value. We firmly believe that women in global supply chains have the potential to be powerful agents for positive change in workplaces and in society. HERproject works to unlock that potential.Story continuesIn FY2023, Tapestry is planning to launch a financial literacy initiative in tandem with HERproject to further many of these efforts. To date, we have reached 53,000 workers, representing 13 factories in Vietnam, India and Cambodia.Since 2013, kate spade new york has partnered with Abahizi Rwanda, an independent, employee-owned, B Corp-certified handbag manufacturer based in Masoro, Rwanda. Abahizi Rwanda employs more than 250 women, providing full-time employment, health benefits and a full spectrum life skills program including access to mental health support for all employees. Abahizi Rwanda manufactures high-quality products for the global fashion industry with a social commitment to empower their employees and transform their community. The company embraces social enterprise principles creating economic and social good for all stakeholders.In April 2021, kate spade new york continued to broaden its impact in the community of Masoro, Rwanda, through their on purpose initiative by partnering with Isooko Community Development, a Rwandan non-profit dedicated to women's and youth health, education, and economic access. In 2021,kate spade new york contributed $177,000 to Isooko, which in part helped to fund the construction of the Masoro Sport and Learning Center.Read moreTapestry, Inc., Tuesday, March 28, 2023, Press release pictureEmployees from kate spade new york's partner facility Abahizi RwandaView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746226/How-Tapestry-is-Supporting-Workers-in-the-its-Global-Supply-Chain]"

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.16%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.12%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.64%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the tool company had lost 9.66% over the past month. This has lagged the Industrial Products sector's loss of 5.06% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.07% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Stanley Black &amp; Decker as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Stanley Black &amp; Decker to post earnings of -$0.73 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 134.76%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4 billion, down 10.09% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $0.83 per share and revenue of $16.21 billion. These totals would mark changes of -82.03% and -4.35%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Stanley Black &amp; Decker. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

Due to the above-mentioned woes, the stock has lost 1% against the industry’s 11.3% increase in the past six months.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue to take a toll on the firm.Weak Segmental Performance: Reduced retail and consumer demand and the resultant softness in volumes are affecting the Tools &amp; Outdoor segment’s performance. Within the segment, the Power Tools division is experiencing weakness (revenues down 5% organically in 2022) due to reduced consumer spending as a result of an increase in interest rates. For 2023, SWK expects segmental organic revenues to decline in the low single digits with an approximately 5% decrease in volumes.Supply-Chain Constraints and Steep Costs: Supply-chain restrictions, primarily due to semiconductor constraints, and logistics and input cost increases weighed on Stanley Black’s operations in 2022. These headwinds pose a threat to the bottom-line performance, despite an improvement in the supply chain and an anticipated decline in raw material costs. Evidently, in 2022, the company’s cost of sales jumped 24.3% year over year. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses climbed 5.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchForex Woes: Given its widespread presence in the international markets, Stanley Black is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. In fourth-quarter 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 3% on sales.Southbound Estimate Revision: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 80.1% downward.Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked companies are discussed below:Deere &amp; Company DE presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

252,1e653637-a3ba-3dc5-b820-b4363bd7e559,NVDA,2023-03-29,Nvidia moves into A.I. services and ChatGPT can now use your credit card,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-moves-services-chatgpt-now-190915315.html,1680030555,STORY,['NVDA'],"[It’s been another head-spinning week in A.I. news. Where to start? Bill Gates saying A.I. is as important as the invention of the microprocessor? Nah, I’m going to begin with Nvidia’s GTC conference, but I want to encourage you all to read the Eye on A.I. Research section (which comes after the news items), where I will tell you about my own experiment with GPT-4 and why I think it indicates we are not glimpsing “the spark of AGI” (artificial general intelligence) as a group of Microsoft computer scientists controversially claimed last week.Now on to Nvidia. The chipmaker whose specialized graphics processing units have become the workhorses for most A.I. computing held its annual developers' conference, much of which was focused on A.I. The chipmaker made a slew of big announcements:- Its next generation of DGX A.I. supercomputers, powered by linked clusters of its H100 GPUs, are now in full production and being made available to major cloud providers and other customers. Each H100 has a built-in “Transformer Engine” for running the Transformer-based large models that underpin generative A.I. The company says the H100 offers nine times faster training times and 30 times faster inference times than its previous generation of A100 GPUs, which were themselves considered the best in the field for A.I. performance.- The company has also started offering its own Nvidia DGX Cloud, built on H100 GPUs, through several of the same cloud providers, starting with Oracle, and then expanding to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. This will allow any company to access A.I. supercomputing resources and software to train their own A.I. models from any desktop browser. The DGX Cloud comes with all those H100s configured and hooked up with Nvidia’s own networking equipment.- Meanwhile, the company announced a separate tie-up with Amazon’s AWS that will see its H100s power new AWS EC2 clusters that can grow to include up to 20,000 GPUs. These will be configured using networking solutions developed by AWS itself, which allows AWS to offer huge systems at potentially lower-cost than the Nvidia DGX Cloud service can.Story continues- The company announced a slate of its own pre-trained A.I. foundation models—for the generation of text (which it calls NeMo) as well as images, 3D rendering, and video (which it calls Picasso)—optimized for its own hardware. It also announced a set of models it calls BioNeMo that it says will help pharmaceutical and biotech companies accelerate drug discovery by generating protein and chemical structures. It announced some important initial business customers for these models too, including Amgen for BioNemo and Adobe, Shutterstock, and Getty for Picasso. (More on that in a minute.)- Interestingly, both the DGX Cloud and Nvidia foundation models put the company into direct competition with some of its best customers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and AWS, all of which are offering companies pre-trained large models of their own and A.I. services in the cloud.- Long-term, one of the most impactful announcements Nvidia made at GTC may have been cuLitho, a machine learning system that can help design future generations of computer chips while consuming far less power than previous methods. The system will help chipmakers design wafers with 2-nanometer scale transistors, the tiniest size currently on chipmakers’ roadmaps—and possibly even smaller ones.Ok, now back to some of those initial customers Nvidia announced for Picasso. Adobe, Shutterstock, and Getty licensed their own image libraries to Nvidia to use to train Picasso—with what Nvidia and the companies say is a method in place to appropriately compensate photographers who provided photos to those sites. The chipmaker also said it is in favor of a system that would let artist and photographers easily label their works with a text tag that would prevent them from being used to train A.I. image generation technology. This should, in theory, avoid the copyright infringement issues and some of the ethical conundrums that are looming over other text-to-image creation A.I. systems and which have made it difficult for companies to use A.I.-generated images for their own commercial purposes. (Getty is currently suing Stability AI for alleged copyright infringement in the creation of the training set for Stable Diffusion, for example.)But it may not be quite as simple as that. Some artists, photographers, legal experts, and journalists have questioned whether Adobe’s Stock license really allows the company to use those images for training an A.I. model. And a proposed compensation system has not yet been made public. It’s unclear if creators will be paid a fixed, flat amount for any image used in model training, on the grounds that each image only contributes a tiny fraction to the final model weights, or whether compensation will vary with each new image the model generates (since the model will draw more heavily on some images in response to a particular prompt). If someone uses an A.I. art system to explicitly ape the style and technique of a particular photographer or artist, one would think that creator would be entitled to more compensation than someone else whose work the model ingested during training, but which wasn’t central to that particular output. But that system would be even more technically complicated to manage and very difficult for the artists themselves to audit. So how will this work and will artists think it is fair? We have no idea.Ok, one of the other big pieces of news last week was that OpenAI connected ChatGPT directly to the internet through a bunch of plugins. The initial set of these include Expedia’s travel sites (so it can look up and book travel), Wolfram (so it can do complex math reliably, an area where large language models have famously struggled), FiscalNote (real-time access to government documents, regulatory decisions, and legal filings), OpenTable (restaurant reservations), and Klarna (so it can buy stuff for you on credit, which you’ll have to pay for later). OpenAI billed this as a way to make ChatGPT even more useful in the real world and as a way to reduce the chance that it will “hallucinate” (make stuff up) or provide out-of-date information in response to questions. Now it has the ability to actually look up the answers on the internet.I’m not the only one who thinks that while these plugins sound useful, they are also potentially dangerous. Before, ChatGPT’s hallucinations were relatively harmless—they were just words, after all. A human would have to read those words and act on them—or at least copy and paste them into a command prompt, in order for anything to happen in the real world. In a way, that meant humans were always in the loop. Those humans might not be paying close enough attention, but at least there was a kind of built-in check on the harm these large language models could do. Now, with these new plugins, if ChatGPT hallucinates, are you going to end up with first-class tickets to Rio you didn’t actually want, or a sofa you’ve bought on credit with Klarna? Who will be liable for such accidents? Will Klarna or your credit card company refund you if you claim ChatGPT misinterpreted your instructions or simply hallucinated? Again, it isn’t clear.Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety in Berkeley, California, told me that competitive pressure seems to be driving tech companies creating these powerful A.I. systems to take unwarranted risks. “If we were to ask people in A.I. research a few years ago if hooking up this kind of A.I. to the internet was a good or bad thing, they all would have said, 'Man, we wouldn’t be stupid enough to do that,'” he says. “Well, things have changed.”Hendrycks says that when he was offering suggestions to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on how it might think about A.I. safety (NIST was in the process of formulating the A.I. framework it released in January), he had recommended that such systems not be allowed to post data to internet servers without human oversight. But with the ChatGPT plugins, OpenAI has “crossed that line. They’ve blown right past it,” he says. He worries this new connectivity makes it much more likely that large language models will be used to create and propagate cyberattacks. And longer-term, he worries OpenAI’s decision sets a dangerous precedent for what will happen when even more sophisticated and potentially dangerous A.I. systems debut.Hendrycks says OpenAI’s actions show that the tech industry shouldn’t be trusted to refrain from dangerous actions. Government regulation, he says, will almost certainly be required. And there are rumblings that it could be coming.

The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector Index climbed nearly 6% over the past month, solidifying its place as the second-best performing group of the S&amp;P 500 during 2023.The most popular and biggest ETFs in the tech sector like Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares US Technology ETF IYW, VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX gained more than 6% each over the past month.The fears of contagion across the globe have compelled investors to adopt an old strategy and flock toward mega caps’ cash-rich balance sheets and durable revenue streams. This is especially true as these companies have strong balance sheets and robust profit margins, and are better positioned to withstand a possible economic downturn. These are also set to benefit from a steep drop in bond yields.In particular, the top three mega names — Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT — have seen more than $600 billion in a combined rally this month. Three other heavyweights — Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA — are the biggest gainers in March. Notably, Alphabet shares are on track for their biggest monthly gain in several years.The decline in yields during the collapse of a series of banks as well as a dovish Fed, also drove the rally. As expected, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 bps in the FOMC meeting but signaled that an end to interest rate increases could be on the horizon. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low. Two-year yields dropped to nearly 3.9% from a 16-year high of 5.084% hit on Mar 8, while 10-year yields plunged to 3.5% from a 15-year high of 4.338% hit on Oct 21 (read: Is it Time for Growth ETFs as Fed Softens Hawkish Tone?).Story continuesETFs in FocusVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)Vanguard Information Technology ETF manages about $45.5 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 367 technology stocks.

With the latest surge, tech stocks have become overvalued. The Zacks Tech sector is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 21.42 compared to 17.32 for the S&amp;P 500. About 48% of the industries in the sector have a top Zacks Rank, suggesting some pain ahead (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Additionally, the earnings outlook for the sector has been clouded by economic concerns. According to Bloomberg Intelligence data, earnings for the technology sector are expected to fall 7.7% in 2023 compared with the growth of 5.2% expected six months ago. The forecasts for revenue growth for the sector have also turned negative over the same period, with consensus moving from a 6% increase to a 0.5% decline.Further, falling bond yields, a key contributor to the recent rally in technology stocks, could prove short-lived if the Fed keeps raising interest rates. However, four of the five above-mentioned ETFs have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance to continue.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company value investors might notice is Henry Schein (HSIC). HSIC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 14.62, while its industry has an average P/E of 17.50. HSIC's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.52 and as low as 12.89, with a median of 15.62, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that HSIC has a P/B ratio of 2.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 6.38. Over the past year, HSIC's P/B has been as high as 3.03 and as low as 2.10, with a median of 2.57.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. HSIC has a P/S ratio of 0.83. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.07.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that HSIC has a P/CF ratio of 14.34. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. HSIC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 23.95. Within the past 12 months, HSIC's P/CF has been as high as 16.14 and as low as 10.52, with a median of 12.91.Another great Medical - Dental Supplies stock you could consider is McKesson (MCK), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.McKesson is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 13.17 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.27. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 17.50 and average PEG ratio of 1.46.Over the past year, MCK's P/E has been as high as 15.66, as low as 12.67, with a median of 14.02; its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.56, as low as 1.12, with a median of 1.79 during the same time period.Additionally, McKesson has a P/B ratio of -22.72 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 6.38. For MCK, this valuation metric has been as high as -21.98, as low as -59.10, with a median of -31.88 over the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Henry Schein and McKesson are likely being undervalued right now.

TRV targets mid-teens ROE over the long term.Business TailwindsRiding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.Given an improving rate environment, the insurer expects after-tax fixed income net investment income, including earnings from short-term securities to average above $535 million per quarter in 2023 with an estimated $515 million in the first quarter. Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive the metric higher.The property and casualty insurer maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. The debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity) was within the insurer’s target range of 15% to 25%.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years. Its current dividend yield of 2.2% is better than the industry average of 0.3%.

(NYSE: TRV) today announced the results of the 2023 Travelers Risk Index on distracted driving, highlighting the dangerous behaviors that occur on U.S. roadways. While technology continues to be a leading cause of distraction, other top reasons include drowsiness, heightened emotions and work-related stress.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005634/en/""Distracted driving can have devastating consequences for families and communities, with accidents, injuries and fatalities on the rise,"" said Michael Klein, Executive Vice President and President of Personal Insurance at Travelers. ""Avoiding distractions while driving is more than just common sense, it’s a responsible and critical step in protecting lives and promoting public health.""Notably, 70% of survey respondents said that they believe distracted driving is more of a problem now than it has been over the past few years. That finding is underscored by estimates from the National Safety Council, which show that deaths due to preventable traffic crashes in 2022 increased by 18% compared with pre-pandemic levels.Following are highlights from the 2023 Travelers Risk Index:TechnologyElectronic devices were among the leading causes of distraction. Activities that drivers acknowledged engaging in while behind the wheel include:Making or receiving calls (80%).Using handheld devices (57%).Posting social media updates (28%).Taking photos or videos (27%).Using technology while driving was also a challenge cited by employers, with more than 30% of executives (a 19% increase from last year) reporting that their employees have been involved in crashes while driving for business purposes because they were distracted by their mobile devices.Drowsiness, Heightened Emotions and Work-Related StressSurvey data also showed that emotional distraction, drowsiness and work-related stress all play significant roles in unsafe driving behaviors. More than 75% of drivers said that they have experienced stress or intense emotions while behind the wheel, and 62% said that they have driven while drowsy.Story continuesAdditionally, 37% of workers surveyed said that they have taken work-related calls, texts or emails while driving. When asked why, 44% said that it might be a work-related emergency, and 43% responded that they felt the need to always be available.Creating Safer RoadwaysRespondents noted a number of steps that could motivate them to remain focused, which would help create safer roads for everyone, including:A passenger requesting that the driver not use the phone (84%).A financial reward for not using the phone while driving (83%).An auto insurance discount (82%).Increased monetary fines (81%).""Driving is a series of microdecisions made in quick succession throughout the course of a trip,"" said Chris Hayes, Assistant Vice President of Workers Compensation and Transportation, Risk Control, at Travelers. ""Any type of distraction – a device, a sleepless night or stress – can make the difference between reaching your destination safely or not.""Hayes added, ""We can all help make our roads safer by taking simple steps, such as putting our phones in ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode, speaking up when we see a driver engaging in dangerous behaviors and not calling co-workers when we know that they’re behind the wheel.""For more information about the Travelers Risk Index, plus ways to reduce distracted driving, please visit Travelers.com.About the Travelers Risk IndexIn January 2023, Hart Research conducted a national online survey of 1,000 consumers, ages 18 to 69, regarding their perceptions and behaviors related to distracted driving.

(NYSE:APD) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 12% in the last quarter. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. It's good to see the share price is up 69% in that time, better than its market return of 60%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Air Products and Chemicals managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Air Products and Chemicals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Air Products and Chemicals' TSR for the last 5 years was 88%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Air Products and Chemicals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 14% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts How Quickly Is Genuine Parts Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Genuine Parts has grown EPS by 24% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Genuine Parts achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 17% to US$22b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Genuine Parts' future profits.Story continuesAre Genuine Parts Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Genuine Parts has a market capitalisation of US$22b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. With a whopping US$52m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Genuine Parts, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.Genuine Parts offered total compensation worth US$10m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Genuine Parts Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Genuine Parts' strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Genuine Parts look rather interesting indeed. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

This would apparently be the first of three waves of reductions, following his February announcement that the company would eliminate a significant number of positions during the year.The move aims to simplify the company’s operations during the ongoing instability in the media sector, and it’s estimated that the company will lay off about 7,000 workers, saving it around $5.5 billion.As soon as Bob Iger took over as CEO of Disney in November, rumors of layoffs began to spread quickly. However, the first official announcement didn’t come until shortly after the company’s last quarterly earnings report in February 2023.Iger revealed the timing of the layoffs in a note to staff, a copy of which was obtained this week by CNN. The first phase will start this week, and managers will soon start getting in touch with staff who will be affected.A second, more significant round of layoffs will take place around April, with several thousand people let go. Igor said that there will be a third round of layoffs before the summer, which will help the company reach its goal of cutting 7,000 jobs.Major Restructuring to Satisfy Activist Investor Ends Proxy FightBack in February following its quarterly earnings release, Disney at the time suggested it would be restructuring its operations – in conjunction with the layoffs – to eventually be made up of three major divisions. These divisions were to be Disney Entertainment, which includes most of its streaming and media operations, ESPN, which runs the cable channel and the streaming service ESPN+, and the Parks, Experiences, and Products division.The announcement came as the company was still engaged in a proxy fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz and his firm Trian Management, but since then, the drama has all but evaporated. Peltz in the past criticized Disney’s acquisition of Fox back in 2019 among other managerial and strategic matters. He had been unhappy with the governance of the company over the years, which he attributed to a loss of shareholder wealth.Story continuesWith a major fight no longer being waged, Disney indicated in a statement that it was grateful to be able to refocus the direction of the company and that the board had nothing but faith in their new CEO and his vision for the future of Disney.Next-gen Project First on the Chopping BlockAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Disney’s next-generation storytelling and consumer experiences division, which was looking into the possibility of Disney entering the so-called metaverse for around the last year, has been one of the first initiatives to be let go.The new division was established a few months after Facebook renamed to Meta in an effort to align with the cutting-edge technology into which CEO Mark Zuckerberg had invested heavily and has since also shown underwhelming results.The group, estimated to have consisted of about 50 employees, was tasked with investigating what the company’s former CEO suggested was the future of storytelling for Disney, using the company’s existing library of intellectual property. According to the report, the team was laid off in the first of three planned waves of layoffs at the company.The Latest in a Long Line of Major Company DismissalsMajor companies that over-hired during the pandemic have been shedding workers in droves in the past twelve months, and Disney is no exception. Since the beginning of this year, more than 150,000 employees have lost their jobs in the tech industry alone, whether big or small, most of which are in the US.In January, Salesforce made public an announcement that it would be terminating the jobs of around 8,000 of its workforce of approximately 80,000 employees. Since then, it has started letting go of staff in small groups rather than all at once.Amazon also announced in January that it would be axing 18,000 workers, and just this week disclosed that it will be laying off another 9,000 In an effort to save expenses as It considers the state of the economy and global uncertainty.In November, Meta fired 11,000 employees and recently announced plans to terminate the employment of a further 10,000 workers over the course of the next two months. The company also suggested it will stop recruiting for 5,000 vacant positions and cancel other low-priority initiatives.Late last year, Disney had around 220,000 employees, with about 166,000 located in the United States, so the 7,000 planned layoffs are around 3% of the company’s worldwide workforce.Daily Disney Chart – Source: ActivTrades’ online platform powered by TradingViewDisclaimerCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 85% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Dirty air filters make your air and cooling system work harder to circulate air. By cleaning or replacing your filters, you can lower your heating and cooling costs.Insulate outlets and light switches–Outlets and light switches on the walls that separate your home from the outdoors are often overlooked sources of heating or cooling loss. Insulating these areas can reduce drafts and keep your home more comfortable.Clear areas around heating and cooling vents–Furniture, carpets and other objects can block vents and prevent heated or cooled air from circulating. This makes your system work harder and prevents rooms from quickly achieving the temperature you desire.Unplug electronics when they’re not in use–Many gadgets, including televisions, DVR boxes, game consoles and computers, continue to use power even when they are off, so unplug electronics when you don’t need them.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.""The Initial Move Is Almost Always A Head Fake""On March 22, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, in-line with market consensus. On March 25, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on this move by the Fed and what he sees for the markets ahead. Cramer was expecting a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed, however, he thinks that the Fed ""was a bit more hawkish"" than he anticipated in light of the banking crisis. Cramer noted that though the Fed is suggesting moving interest rates higher than the current level, the Fed funds futures indicate 8 cuts by the back half of 2023.Cramer pointed out an interesting pattern that the markets have followed over the past year after every FOMC meeting since March 2022. Cramer thinks that this pattern can be insightful and can potentially guide the direction of the market in the near-term. Cramer noted that before the March 2022 rate hike, the intraday average movement of the S&amp;P 500 in either direction was 1.15%. He defined this as the baseline and pointed out that out of 9 times the Fed has raised interest rates, 7 times the S&amp;P 500 exhibited a bigger move than its intraday average. Cramer's analysis shows that the initial 3-day move of the markets, after the Fed's rate hike, reverses in the following 3 months. This has held true for 7 out of 8 times over the Fed's hiking cycle, that began in March 2022. Cramer thinks that ""the initial move is almost always a head fake"".While the pattern is noteworthy, Jim Cramer thinks that it is ""dangerous to predict we're going to rally over the next 3 months"", especially amid the banking crisis. The key takeaway for investors according to Cramer is that ""the initial reaction of the Fed's rate hikes has been wrong, every time, over the past year"".Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best cheap stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer.

(NYSE:EPD) was held by 24 hedge funds. These funds disclosed positions worth $242.4 million in the company, up from $221.6 million in the previous quarter when 21 hedge funds held stakes in the company. The hedge fund sentiment for the stock is positive.On March 2, Scotiabank analyst Tristan Richardson started coverage of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) with an Outperform rating and a $31 price target.In one of his recent episodes, Jim Cramer recommended Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) to one of his callers over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET). Cramer noted that while Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET) is offering a higher yield than his preference, he still prefers Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET).As of March 28, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is trading at a TTM PE ratio of 10.20 and is offering a forward dividend yield of 7.73%. Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP).Helmerich &amp; Payne currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Helmerich &amp; Payne here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Helmerich &amp; Payne, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in HP?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Helmerich &amp; Payne, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.68.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Helmerich &amp; Payne. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Helmerich &amp; Payne.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PINS recently disclosed definite plans to reduce operating costs as it aims to mitigate risks amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. The strategic move is part of a focused restructuring initiative to improve its margins for sustainable business practices in the wake of cut-throat competition from established players in the market.The company has decided not to renew the leases of certain office spaces and expects to significantly reduce its recurring costs by the end of 2023. The office space reduction is in concurrence with the contraction in the workforce that it had initiated last month. Pinterest reportedly slashed its workforce by about 150 employees out of a total of 4,000 by the end of December 2022. The company anticipates incurring $100 million to $125 million charges related to the restructuring plan.The restructuring plan is likely to offset higher operating expenses for expanding operations domestically and internationally, enhancing product offerings, broadening Pinner and advertiser base, expanding marketing channels and developing technology. In fourth-quarter 2022, total costs and expenses increased 31% year over year $871.3 million. While cost of sales and marketing surged 66% to $317.3 million, research and development expenses rose to $265.2 million from $240.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was largely driven by ongoing investments in innovation, including mobile deep linking, entire page optimization, and improved measurement tools and stronger brand marketing campaign.However, Pinterest is increasingly establishing a unique value proposition to advertisers that could provide a competitive advantage in the long haul. It continues to dramatically improve the advertising platform, which presently appears to be one of the best ad platforms for consumer discretionary brands looking for new ways to reach customers and stretch smaller ad budgets. Pinterest’s Verified Merchants Program allows brands to create a catalog of shoppable products on the app and use special re-targeting capabilities in their ads.The acquisition of the AI-powered, high-tech fashion-shopping platform, The Yes, has further enabled it to steer the evolution of its features and merchants. Pinterest and The Yes share a common vision of making it easy for customers to find products matching their tastes and style. The company has been making continuous efforts to absorb creators’ publishing videos and live streams to make the shopping experience swift and easy for customers.The stock has gained 5.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 32.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPinterest currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It was Comcast's first Lift Zone in the country.Later, in 2021, after The Sanneh Foundation suffered a devastating fire that forced it to shut down, our teams worked quickly to install free WiFi at a second location so that the families and students could continue to stay connected. This new location, The Sanneh Foundation's Seton Center, also marked the 1,000th Lift Zone milestone for our program.Partnerships with community-based organizations are at the heart of our work to advance digital equity and to help create a world of unlimited possibilities through our $1 billion initiative, Project UP. Even though nearly all schools have now returned to in-person classes, there remains a need for community learning spaces with free WiFi where people can learn digital skills or even get one-on-one technical support or instruction.That's why we're going even further to help by funding an AmeriCorps Community Technology Empowerment Program (CTEP) member at The Sanneh Foundation. This trusted, local resource - called a digital navigator - will expand the scope of digital literacy skills classes offered to youth, help seniors connect with loved ones, and assist community residents with job searches and application submissions.Story continuesThanks to this support from Comcast, students will be able to increase their computer skills that lead to higher paying jobs and careers in technology, and the digital navigator will be available to senior community members who are looking for basic instruction on how to set up computers, create email accounts or even connect with their grandchildren.TONY SANNEHFounder and CEO, The Sanneh FoundationIn addition, we are supporting the St. Paul Neighborhood Network (SPNN), the local Twin Cities organization that manages AmeriCorps' CTEP, by providing funding for operations and member support. This builds on our nationwide effort to create and scale a network of digital navigators who are trained to help people learn how to get online, use devices, and acquire digital skills.Digital navigators are critical to closing the digital divide and reducing socioeconomic inequalities. A Comcast-supported study by the Boston Consulting Group found that with the support of these digital case workers, Internet usage climbed significantly, access to basic needs like healthcare increased, and 1 in 3 users found a new job or earned a higher income.The need for connectivity has never been greater. By working with partners like The Sanneh Foundation and SPNN to expand broadband adoption, we can help close the homework gap, advance economic mobility, and achieve digital equity.KALYN HOVERegional Senior Vice President, Comcast Twin Cities RegionWe know from years of experience that no single company, nonprofit, or government program is ever going to close the digital divide alone. At Comcast we therefore partner with thousands of local community-based organizations like The Sanneh Foundation and SPNN. We share a mutual and deep commitment to coalition building because working together, we know we can make sustainable and meaningful change.Broderick Johnson is Executive Vice President, Public Policy &amp; Executive Vice President, Digital Equity.Lift Zones and digital navigator programs, as well as partnerships with organizations such as The Sanneh Foundation and SPNN are part of Project UP.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746203/Rebuilding-After-Fire-To-Keep-a-Community-Connected]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.""The Initial Move Is Almost Always A Head Fake""On March 22, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, in-line with market consensus. On March 25, Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on this move by the Fed and what he sees for the markets ahead. Cramer was expecting a quarter-point rate hike from the Fed, however, he thinks that the Fed ""was a bit more hawkish"" than he anticipated in light of the banking crisis. Cramer noted that though the Fed is suggesting moving interest rates higher than the current level, the Fed funds futures indicate 8 cuts by the back half of 2023.Cramer pointed out an interesting pattern that the markets have followed over the past year after every FOMC meeting since March 2022. Cramer thinks that this pattern can be insightful and can potentially guide the direction of the market in the near-term. Cramer noted that before the March 2022 rate hike, the intraday average movement of the S&amp;P 500 in either direction was 1.15%. He defined this as the baseline and pointed out that out of 9 times the Fed has raised interest rates, 7 times the S&amp;P 500 exhibited a bigger move than its intraday average. Cramer's analysis shows that the initial 3-day move of the markets, after the Fed's rate hike, reverses in the following 3 months. This has held true for 7 out of 8 times over the Fed's hiking cycle, that began in March 2022. Cramer thinks that ""the initial move is almost always a head fake"".While the pattern is noteworthy, Jim Cramer thinks that it is ""dangerous to predict we're going to rally over the next 3 months"", especially amid the banking crisis. The key takeaway for investors according to Cramer is that ""the initial reaction of the Fed's rate hikes has been wrong, every time, over the past year"".Story continuesWe have compiled a list of the best cheap stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer.

(NYSE:EPD) with an Outperform rating and a $31 price target.In one of his recent episodes, Jim Cramer recommended Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) to one of his callers over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET). Cramer noted that while Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET) is offering a higher yield than his preference, he still prefers Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) over Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET).As of March 28, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is trading at a TTM PE ratio of 10.20 and is offering a forward dividend yield of 7.73%. Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8.

That compares with an average of analysts’ estimates of $3.75 billion. The company also announced more job cuts. Shares were up as much as 3.2% at $61.18 in premarket trading.“Customer inventories are getting better, and we expect gradual improvements to the industry’s supply-demand balance,” Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said in the statement. The company delivered earnings for the second quarter that were in line with its projections “in a challenging market environment,” he said.The forecast suggests the memory chip market may be poised for a comeback after a rough stretch. Over the past year, a steep drop in consumer demand spurred Micron’s customers to slash orders. Instead of buying new chips, they’ve been working through a pileup of excess inventory — a type of scenario that has long plagued the memory industry following boom years.Just hours before Micron released its guidance, German chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG raised its own forecasts for the quarter and the full year, citing stronger-than-expected sales of automotive and industrial products. Demand, particularly from the auto industry, has buoyed earnings for some chipmakers as manufacturers recover from Covid 19-era shortages and global uncertainties brought about by the war in Ukraine.Micron’s stock had gained 19% this year, closing at $59.28 in regular New York trading on Tuesday.Story continuesThe company is projecting a loss of about $1.58 a share in the current period, which includes a 45-cent impact associated with $500 million in inventory writedowns. Analysts had estimated a loss of 84 cents a share.Makers of phones and computers are dealing with weak consumer spending triggered by rising inflation. Micron’s chips, which store and help handle information in such devices, are particularly vulnerable to swings in demand because products from rival companies are directly interchangeable and are traded like commodities.Rapid fluctuations in the balance between supply and demand can leave producers selling the components for less than they cost to make. Even though Micron shipped more computer memory chips last quarter, revenue still shrank because prices fell about 20%.Three months ago, Micron announced cost-cutting measures, including a 10% workforce reduction and a slowdown in investment in new production. While the revenue picture will improve in the second half of the year, profitability will remain difficult, it had said.The Boise, Idaho-based company said Tuesday that its total headcount reduction will now equal 15%. Micron is reducing its spending on new plants and equipment by 40% to $7 billion this year, according to presentation slides posted on its website.For 2023, the company expects that demand will grow faster than supply. Micron projects a transition to sequential revenue growth, saying that inventory has peaked and end markets such as smartphones and personal computers are contracting less severely than feared. Micron’s data center unit bottomed in the second fiscal quarter, it said.Mehrotra has argued that the company would deliver more stable earnings than in past downturns. The industry now has a small number of competitors — and they’re more focused on profits than gaining market share — potentially making the field more resilient. Memory chips also have a wider range of uses than in the past.But that thesis came undone due to a unique set of circumstances: the war in Ukraine, a surge in inflation, Covid disruptions and other supply-chain woes.Micron competes with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. SK — which, like Micron, is focused mostly on memory — has also suffered losses, causing it to curb expansion plans. Samsung, meanwhile, has a more diversified business. It’s the world’s largest smartphone maker and has other sizable divisions, allowing it to remain profitable and have the cash to invest.The pace at which profitability recovers will be determined by whether the company’s peers follow its lead and reduce production to the point that supply will be below last year’s level, Mehrotra said in an interview. Other companies have taken actions to varying degrees, he said.“The recovery could be accelerated if further supply cuts are made,” he said.In the three months ended March 2, Micron’s revenue declined 53% to $3.69 billion. The company had a loss of $1.91 a share, excluding certain items. That compares with an average estimate of a loss of 63 cents a share and sales of $3.75 billion.Showing the impact of a collapse in orders, the company is on course to lose more than $3 billion in 2023, its worst annual deficit since it first went public in 1984.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsDungeons &amp; Dragons’ Epic Quest to Finally Make MoneyThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeJohn Wick’s Blowout Opening Lifts Lions Gate, But It Won’t Fix StarzUS and Europe Wrangle Over Green Subsidies to Avoid a Trade War©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Market jitters about stress in the banking system have been soothed in recent days by a U.S. regulator-backed sale of failed lender Silicon Valley Bank's assets as well as lack of fresh signs of trouble in the sector since the buyout deal.Regional U.S. bank stocks were mixed, with lenders such as Truist Financial Corp and Western Alliance Bancorp up 1% and 0.6%, respectively, while First Republic Bank edged 0.7% lower.Larger peers Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co rose between 0.7% and 1.6% in premarket trade.A retreat in Treasury yields, which had rebounded over the past two sessions amid ebbing banking concerns, lifted major technology and growth stocks, with Microsoft Corp, Alphabet and Meta Platforms up 0.8% to 1%.""Markets are calmer as the tension of the banking situation is lessening. The fact that yields are a bit lower this morning is likely to induce stock markets to move higher,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.The banking turmoil, which started earlier in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, has led markets to reprice expectations of future monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.Traders' bets are tilted towards no rate hike by the Fed in May, with odds of a 25-basis-point increase at 42%, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.""We'll (likely) see the Fed ending its campaign at the May meeting and the reason for that is because recession is not far away,"" Cardillo said.Story continuesMichael Barr, the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, will testify before Congress for a second day after he criticized SVB's risk management on Tuesday.Investors will also monitor a report on pending home sales later in the day. A key inflation reading expected at the end of the week will provide more clues on the Fed's monetary tightening plans.The CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest since March 9, reflecting easing investor anxiety.At 6:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 244 points, or 0.75%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 35.25 points, or 0.88%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 109.25 points, or 0.86%.Among major stock moves, Micron Technology Inc advanced 2.3% after the chipmaker forecast a boost to sales in 2025 from artificial intelligence.U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd slipped 1.2% before the bell, a day after touching an over one-month high on the internet giant's revamp and listing plan.Lululemon Athletica Inc jumped 14.9% after forecasting annual sales and profit above estimates, while Lucid Group Inc gained 2.5% on plans to lay off about 18% of its workforce.

For more mutual fund companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Mutual Fund Companies in the World. The finance market of 2023 is significantly different from that a couple of decades back. There are numerous investment vehicles in which both ordinary and institutional investors can invest their funds and ensure a stable return. Some of the asset classes in which investors can place their money include equities, real estate, bonds, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and money market vehicles. These are broad categories since each of these has a variety of other investment options within them. For instance, the money market vehicle sector consists of several investment vehicles such as short term treasury bonds, commercial papers, money market mutual funds, deposit certificates, commercial papers, and repurchase agreements.At the same time, while investors can simply pick and choose stocks of their choice for investment, there are other options as well that allow them to leverage professional expertise when allocating their money. Two kinds of investment vehicles that are commonly available are exchange traded funds and mutual funds. Out of these, the former is a collection of different shares with investment allocations based on a percentage whose single unit is sold throughout the trading day. The latter is also a basket of securities but is usually traded only once a day. There are several ways in which investors can profit from a mutual fund. These include making gains through an increase in the value of the fund itself, or through dividends, if the basket of securities that the fund invests in is made up of dividend paying stocks. Additionally, alongside stocks, mutual funds also invest in bonds, and some of the benefits that they offer include diversification, low costs, and liquidity.Mutual funds are also some of the most popular investment vehicles in the U.S. According to statistics from ICI Global, more than half of American households owned a mutual fund last year. In numerical terms, this entails that 52.3% of the 68.6 million American households had owned mutual funds in 2022, leading to an approximate number of 115.3 million individuals having invested in the investment vehicles. More than two thirds of these were earning less than $150,000 annually, and 54% of the households holding mutual funds were led by individuals whose ages ranged between 35 and 64 years, and most of these were not making significant amounts of money, as the research also shows that the median household income of these individuals was $100,000. In statistics, the median of a data sample is its middle set of values, which removes the effects of outliers in reaching conclusions.Story continuesAt the same time, the median income of these households was higher than the median income of all American households, which stood at $69,000 during the surveyed time period. The households that had owned mutual funds had higher education levels as well, with 80% having completed education higher than an Associate degree while the average American household saw only 66% with similar education levels. Finally, the majority, or 81%, of these investors had invested in stock market mutual funds, with money market mutual funds coming in at second place with 50% of households having invested in them.In terms of market value, the U.S. mutual fund market is one of the biggest in the world. Data from Refinitiv shows that the U.S. fund market, made up of both ETFs and mutual funds, was worth $29.3 trillion as of December 2022. Fund returns last year matched the macroeconomic environment, with commodities funds posting an 8% annual return, while equity, taxable fixed income, and global equities dropped by 16.8%, 8.5%, and 12.8%, respectively. The turmoil in the financial market has continued this year as well, with the collapse of SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) reducing confidence in the banking system and causing an outflow of funds into the money market segment instead.According to a report from the Financial Times, weekly inflows into money market funds crossed $120 billion during March 2023 in the aftermath of the SVB disaster, with $93 billion of funds flowing in just two days. The $120 billion in inflows was also almost half of the amount that has flown into money market funds this year, as FT estimates this figure to stand at $250 billion.The sheer scale of the American mutual funds market is evident when we take a look at the global market. A research report from Technavio believes that the global funds market is estimated to grow by $71.6 trillion between 2022 and 2027, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.76%. Out of the total market size, North America will be the largest contributor, as it will account for 52% of the total market.So when should you invest in mutual funds? Fisher Investments' Ken Fisher believes that a key reason for buying a mutual fund is if you believe that the fund manager is a better investor than you are. He adds that:If however, you have very small amounts of money, you can't do that (buy the same stocks as those tracked by the fund). Because the costs of the stocks still remain low, but if you have very small amounts of money, you can't diversify. And there's a huge benefit to diversification. So you can get that diversification through the ETF or the mutual fund, other things being equal, usually I would prefer the ETF to the mutual fund because it tends to be more tax efficient. Costs tend to be lower, but not necessarily lower.Today, we'll look at some of the biggest mutual fund companies in the world, with the top ones being The Vanguard Group, Inc., BlackRock, Inc.

With these new inductees, COH now includes more than 10,000 members across four continents, with a shared 305,691 years of accident-free safe driving.All of UPS’s more than 100,000 drivers benefit from the company’s commitment to industry-leading training. That cutting-edge training is showcased at Integrad®, UPS’s dedicated driver training schools. These schools pioneered the use of virtual reality (VR) in an industrial training environment. The UPS Driving Simulator provides realistic driving experiences before UPS drivers operate an actual delivery vehicle. This VR experience is coupled with hands-on driving and instructor-led classroom training delivered by elite professional trainers.""Safe driving is no accident. Our drivers have a passion for safety that is built on a foundation of best-in-class training programs,"" said Executive Vice President and President U.S., Nando Cesarone. ""The most important stop for our drivers is when they return home safely after work. And that’s why it’s our top priority to build a safe place to work that delivers on our promise to provide great paths for every UPSer to achieve their career goals.""Training at Integrad facilities includes real-life challenges with typical road hazards, such as pedestrians, parked cars and oncoming traffic, to ensure our drivers are ready to keep themselves and their communities safe while on the road. Our culture of safety spans training and support services within our facilities and hubs and for on-the-road drivers and is backed by an investment in 2022 alone totaling more than $343 million on safety training courses.Story continues""Safety begins with the right training and is a process of daily commitment and continual learning,"" said Jacqueline Williams, a UPS Circle of Honor driver with 42 years of accident-free driving. ""I use the safe work methods we learn every day. They help me and my fellow drivers to stay safe while keeping our customers and communities safe as well.""UPS drivers are not only among the safest in the industry, but also the best paid. UPS provides employees with industry-leading pay and benefits, and the average yearly compensation of full-time package delivery drivers is $95,000. In addition to the health and welfare benefits that UPS provides, the total compensation for drivers is about $145,000 a year. For those who seek flexibility, part-time UPS employees receive the same generous healthcare benefits as full-time employees, which requires no premiums, no co-insurance and low co-pays.Visual assets are available here.To learn more, go to https://about.ups.com/sg/en/our-company/great-employer.html.About UPSUPS (NYSE: UPS) is one of the world’s largest companies, with 2022 revenue of $100.3 billion, and provides a broad range of integrated logistics solutions for customers in more than 220 countries and territories.

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 81% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 49% (not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for American Express While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).American Express was able to grow its EPS at 7.5% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 22% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of American Express, it has a TSR of 88% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican Express shareholders are down 13% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -14%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 14% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors.

Upbeat view, a growing international business and efficient capital deployment are driving the stock.Headquartered in New York, American Express benefits from innovative service offerings and consumer spending resilience. It is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. It currently has a market cap of $118.9 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan It Retain Momentum?The answer is yes and before we get into the details, let us show you how its estimates for 2023 stand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share currently stands at $11.25, signaling a 14.2% year-over-year increase. AXP beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 4.5%.Also, the consensus mark for 2023 revenues is pegged at $61.1 billion, predicting 15.6% growth from the 2022 level.Now let’s delve into what’s driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Strong financials are positioning the company for expedited growth. The company had $34 billion in cash and cash equivalents at fourth quarter-end, which jumped 55% year over year. It had a manageable short-term borrowing of $1 billion. Also, a solid cash position places it in a comfortable spot to service its financial commitments. Free cash flows jumped 46.8% year over year to $19.2 billion in the trailing 12-month period.Its financial strength is supporting shareholder value boosting efforts. The company bought back 20 million common shares worth $3.3 billion last year and paid dividends worth $1.6 billion. Earlier this month, it announced a new buyback plan, equipping it to repurchase up to 120 million common shares. Also, AXP approved a 15% hike in the quarterly dividend.American Express currently has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesAXP’s focus on enhancing innovative service offerings and global footprint will drive long-term growth. In a bid to benefit its consumers and small business Card Members, the company collaborated with Australia-based payment solutions provider Cuscal to introduce the card bill PayID service throughout the country. Its focus on capturing market share of growing economies is praiseworthy.American Express’s coverage in the UK and other regions continues to accelerate as leading businesses across home improvement, food-to-go and broader retail sectors are partnering with the company. Discount revenues are the largest revenue source of the company and are likely to increase as more merchants team up with AXP.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that investors should keep in mind.Rising expenses are eating into profits. Throughout 2021 and 2022, AXP’s total expenses jumped 22% and 24% year over year, respectively. Also, its forward 12-month price to earnings of 14.1% is higher than the industry average of 10.7%, making it an expensive stock. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive long-term growth.Other Key Picks in FinanceMeanwhile, investors interested in the broader finance space can look into other top-ranked stocks like Euronet Worldwide, Inc.

The report found that 98% of senior IT leaders have been impacted by increasing cloud complexity in some capacity, potentially leading to poor IT performance, loss in revenue and barriers to business growth.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230329005156/en/""Our global research report highlights paradigm shifts in how technology leaders look at and manage their cloud initiatives,"" said Ronen Schwartz, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cloud Storage, NetApp. ""As cloud adoption accelerates and businesses innovate faster to compete, technology leaders are facing growing pressure to juggle multiple priorities at once – causing many to rethink how they manage efficiency and security in this new environment.""""Our global survey data demonstrates the extreme complexity of modern IT environments, and the pressure technology executives are under to show measurable outcomes from cloud investments,"" said Gabie Boko, Chief Marketing Officer, NetApp. ""At NetApp, we've simplified the complex through our approach, which enables technology executives to increase the speed of innovation, lower costs and improve consistency, flexibility and agility across on-premises and cloud environments.""Key findings from the report include:Cloud Complexity Reaches a Tipping PointData complexity has reached a boiling point for companies globally, and tech executives are feeling the pressure to contain its impact on the business. However, technical and organizational challenges may stunt their cloud strategies, with 88% citing working across cloud environments as a barrier, while 32% struggle just to align on a clear vision at the leadership level.Story continuesGlobal Context: The following regions list this as their top concern if data complexity is not managed:Cybersecurity: France, Spain, and Australia/New ZealandLeadership skepticism: France, Spain, JapanInefficient use across the organization: Australia/New ZealandLack of visibility: JapanLeadership Want Cloud Results NowSustainability has become an unexpected cloud-driver, with nearly eight in ten tech executives citing ESG outcomes as critical to their cloud strategy. However, return on investment (ROI) is a concern among leadership, with 84% of tech executives saying their cloud strategy is already expected to show results across the organization.Global Context:Nearly half of tech executives (49%) report that when cloud strategy discussions happen, cost concerns come up often or all the time.Data regulation and compliance is another cloud driver, with various local regulations promoting their multicloud strategy most or some of the time.Tech Executives Consider AI as a Possible SolutionIn the next year, over a third (37%) of tech executives report that half or more of their cloud deployments will be supported by AI-driven applications. Nearly half of tech executives at smaller companies – those with fewer than 250 employees – expect to reach the 50% mark in the next year, and 63% by 2030, while larger companies lag.Global Context:The U.S. leads EMEA and APAC on plans to deploy AI-driven cloud applications in the next year, with France and Japan as outliers in their regions.Scaling AI is the top priority in EMEA and APAC, but is second in the U.S., behind meeting regulatory compliance.""NetApp’s global research report reveals a disconnect between the executives outside of IT and those within - specifically, leaders working to execute on cloud are the ones most ingrained in the cost and complexity issues while those outside of IT have yet to fully understand. In the process of shifting to the cloud, leaders are experiencing challenges, leaving room for vendors to address these current or yet-to-be discovered issues,"" said Randy Kerns, Senior Strategist &amp; Analyst at the Evaluator Group. ""As customers express concerns with cloud implementation, vendors have the opportunity to build and offer solutions to simplify the process.""As organizations increasingly move to multi-cloud environments, NetApp aims to alleviate efficiency bottlenecks by allowing IT leaders to manage their systems on one, streamlined user interface.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Zimmer Biomet and LeMaitre Vascular are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that ZBH likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than LMAT has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ZBH currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.90, while LMAT has a forward P/E of 43.92. We also note that ZBH has a PEG ratio of 2.89. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

Communication services, tech, and real estate were the only sectors to finish the day lower; the former two sectors also dragged on the Nasdaq, resulting in the tech-heavy index to fall 0.5%, according to Bespoke Investments.Shares of First Citizens jumped to a record high, extending gains for the second consecutive day on Tuesday after acquiring the deposits and loans of SVB. Meanwhile, shares of SVB Financial, which were delisted on the New York Stock Exchange, began trading over the counter for less than 30 cents.As banks dominated the headlines again this week, federal regulators were slammed with intense questions from lawmakers on Tuesday regarding the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank. All three regulators agreed that financial regulations need to be tightened following the recent turmoil.“I anticipate the need to strengthen capital and liquidity standards for banks with over $100 billion,” Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said at the Senate Banking Committee hearing, responding to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren's question.During the hearing, lawmakers also pressed on the issue that executives of the banks should face consequences leading up to the failures.Story continuesThe House Financial Services Committee will hold its own hearing on Wednesday and question Barr, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, and Treasury Undersecretary Nellie Liang.“If bank contagion fears subside, then we may see a resurgence in both bond yields and commodities as growth, before the banking crises, was stronger than expected led by the US and a reopened China,” wrote the U.S. market intelligence team at JPMorgan in a note.“However, banking crises typically have wide-ranging, and negative, impacts on growth and employment,” the team added.A general view of First Citizens Bank name and logo.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Capital One FinancialOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Commercial Banking, Neal Blinde, for US$921k worth of shares, at about US$115 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$91.12). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Notably Neal Blinde was also the biggest buyer, having purchased US$3.7k worth of shares.All up, insiders sold more shares in Capital One Financial than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Capital One Financial better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Capital One Financial Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Capital One Financial. In total, President of Commercial Banking Neal Blinde sold US$921k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesDoes Capital One Financial Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Capital One Financial insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$436m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Capital One Financial Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Capital One Financial stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for Capital One Financial you should be aware of, and 1 of them makes us a bit uncomfortable.But note: Capital One Financial may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Looking at shares closing up just about 2%.Let's talk with the analyst behind that bullish call. We want to bring in Susan Anderson, Canaccord Genuity analyst. Susan, it's great to see you here. So you think Ulta still has a ways to go in this rally. Why are you bullish?SUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, so the beauty category itself we really haven't seen slow much. It definitely had some rebounds post COVID, but it's continued to be strong into this year. Credit-card data showing it actually picked up in February, and then that strength continued into March. So, you know, I think that's only going to benefit Ulta.We also see them as a share gainer despite the higher growth category. We see them taking share from department stores, particularly as they roll out their prestige business further and then also add luxury such as Dior to their lineup of brands that they sell in the store.Also the robust loyalty program that they have we think has benefited them. They're able to really connect with their consumer through that program and drive sales through it. So I think that's also been a differentiator.And then finally their omnichannel capabilities. So they've been able to sell, you know, wherever the consumer wants to buy, and they really saw a robust online business during COVID, which has continued. It's just over 20% of their sales now, and we think that's beneficial to them as well.So we continue to see them not only as being a share gainer in the space but also benefiting from the very strong beauty trends.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, their COO just told Brian Sozzi 40.2 million in that loyalty program. Impressive. Susan, how significant is the partnership with Target in terms of driving future growth?Story continuesSUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, so in 350 doors. They're rolling out to more. You know, I think it's been a great partnership for them, not only in terms of incremental sales-- while the contribution's still somewhat small, relatively speaking, I think in terms of just gaining new customers which then come into Ulta itself has been huge for them. I think it's really allowed them to expand their customer base.SEANA SMITH: I know you've been tracking some credit-card data. When it comes to consumer spending on beauty, are you seeing any signs of weakness given the fact that there is so much uncertainty right now?SUSAN ANDERSON: It's slowed, you know, from the high-double-digit rates we saw last year, which a lot of that was a COVID rebound. So we're not expecting it to continue to grow 15%, 18%, 20% in the prestige category this year, but we think it can still be easily strong high single digits if not low double digits. So there has been somewhat of a slowdown but still very strong versus what we saw pre-COVID. So I think that strength will continue through the year.DAVE BRIGGS: 1,355 stores with plans to go between 1,500 and 1,700. Where are they opening those stores? Are those in malls, or are those standalone stores?SUSAN ANDERSON: Well, I think Ulta's-- you know, one of their differentiators and really I think has benefited them has the fact that they've been mainly off mall, unlike Sephora which has also done really well, but they're, you know, more in malls. And I think also, you know, that's been an issue with the department stores too being in malls where we've just seen less traffic. Consumers want more convenience. They want to be able to pop in the store quickly, pick up what they need. They don't want to have to walk through, you know, a large department store and through the entire mall just to get to one store that they're looking for. So I think that's been a huge benefit to them as they've, you know, seen these share gains over the last several years.SEANA SMITH: Susan, supply-chain issues, is that at all still a challenge here for the company? And also when we talk about inflation, how much have we seen some of these prices increase across the category?SUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, so, you know, we're definitely seeing supply-chain issues die down and inflation in certain areas. Transportation has come down quite a bit. Last year it was at historical highs. That's almost come back down to where it was. We've also seen commodity costs come down quite a bit.The one thing that has remained sticky and still up there is labor. So that's still going to be a pressure point for them this year. But the other areas, you know, I think it could be a tailwind for their margins for this year.DAVE BRIGGS: We don't primarily think of Ulta as a services category, but their COO just talked about that, again, with Brian Sozzi. How significant is that now and could it be down the road?SUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, so the salons in their stores, that's still a small part of their business. It takes up, I want to say, 10% of the square footage in the stores, but it's still single-digit percent of sales. So I think it's definitely a growth opportunity for them and a way for them to convert not only just services but product sales during those service visits. So I think it's definitely an opportunity for them to increase the sales there.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and, Susan, going back to what you started with here, one of the main reasons why you're bullish is given the fact that their loyalty program has become so popular. Just around 40 million members right now. Is there really significant upside just in terms of the growth trajectory of that number given the fact that it is so large?SUSAN ANDERSON: Yeah, it's definitely one of the largest programs out there, particularly, you know, not including the mass retailers. Like Target has over a hundred million customers in their loyalty program. The next largest is probably Ulta. So it's definitely very large, but there's over a hundred million adult women in the US, so we think there's still opportunity for them to grow that loyalty program.And then on top of that, you have the Gen Zers coming up to age, and they'll become part of that loyalty program. I think one of Ulta's key strengths is the fact that they cater so well to this younger consumer. And so I think as those younger consumers grow up, there's just more opportunity to add to that program.SEANA SMITH: All right, Susan Anderson, thanks so much for joining us.]"

Yahoo Finance's executive editor Brian Sozzi had a chance to talk to Ulta Beauty COO Kecia Steelman about the company's growth, where consumers are shopping, and what could come next for the retailer. Let's listen.KECIA STEELMAN: The consumer right now is loving coming into the Ulta Beauty store. I think one of the things that makes us really unique is that we offer everything that she could want from mass to prestige, hair, skin care, wellness, et cetera. You know, the consumer is still coming in, and they're spending with us.BRIAN SOZZI: What is the magic of Ulta? Full disclosure, I go to Ulta. I get my face creams at Ulta. Explain some of the magic that I see when I walk into one of your stores.KECIA STEELMAN: Well, I'm happy that we're able to take care of your skin, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: I look-- I'm really 25.KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah, it looks great.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, thank you.KECIA STEELMAN: It looks great. It looks great.I would say that, you know, when you come into an Ulta Beauty store, we're there to help you be your best self, and we're not intimidating. We're open. We create an environment where people can truly be their authentic self when they come into the store. And we also cross all price points from mass to prestige to masstige. So we have something for everyone when you're coming into the store location, and I think that's really resonated well.95% of our consumers are Ulta Beauty enthusiasts that are in our loyalty program, so we know what they're shopping. We know what they're buying. We stay really close to them, and we're listening to what they're wanting from us. And we continue to add more to the assortment to give her everything that she wants.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: What are the hottest areas of an Ulta store right now?KECIA STEELMAN: Oh, the whole store is hot, Brian. The whole store is hot. But I would say one of the categories that we're really seeing that's coming through COVID that's really stuck is wellness. You know, the consumer is really focused on wellness in addition to all their beauty regimens, which is great because wellness was really important as we were going through COVID. But, you know, now that people are getting back out and going to parties and being more active like places like Shoptalk, they want to put makeup on, and they want to get glammed up a little bit more. So we're seeing wellness stick, and we're also seeing them really lean in a little bit more to cosmetics, which is great.BRIAN SOZZI: Where's Ulta in the services journey, and what are you focused on this year in that area?KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah, so our services, it's fantastic because we have services in all of our locations. You know, we have hair, skin, brows.You know, what we've seen is that the consumer is really still focused on color for hair and also hair health. So hair health and wellness and thickening, you know, that's really important to the guests still right now today. So they're coming in for our salon services.Brows-- men and women both are coming in to get their Benefit brow services.BRIAN SOZZI: I can get my brows done in Ulta?KECIA STEELMAN: Yes, you can. We'll take care of that. We'll take care of that for you.BRIAN SOZZI: Where is the men's section? So I go into an Ulta. I just told you I shop there.KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there going to be a day, and when might it be, I can go in there and I have a dedicated men's section, that I can just go in there and buy men products?KECIA STEELMAN: Well, I absolutely know that we do care about the men that are shopping at Ulta Beauty, and I'd say that there's sections all throughout the store. We may have to get you some guidance as you're coming into the shop, but we have products for men in all of our locations.But, you know, I would say lean more towards online. It's a little bit easier to maybe navigate for the men right now today. But we're going to continue to focus on men. They're important to us, and we've got to keep you looking good still, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: I appreciate that. So you mentioned the loyalty members. What, over 40 million?KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah, 40.2.BRIAN SOZZI: What are you-- what are you seeing? How are they spending with you right now, and how do you plan to leverage that data moving forward?KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah, what we're really pleased that we see is that the consumer across all income sectors is spending, you know, at a great pace. There's not one income sector that's outperforming another. So it's very consistent across the spectrum, and I think part of that is because we do offer everything in one place across all price points.You know, the consumer is really pleased with what they're seeing at Ulta Beauty, and, you know, that loyalty penetration-- that membership is still remaining high. We've just come off of a fantastic year. Hit $10.2 billion in sales with that 40.2 million customers that are coming in. So, you know, the customer in our loyalty program is liking what they're seeing, and they're coming into our stores, and they're shopping online too.BRIAN SOZZI: I really found this interesting. Just this is the first time we talked. I follow you on Instagram, but you started working, what, in a Target store?KECIA STEELMAN: I did.BRIAN SOZZI: Now you're seeing or running or helping to drive the Ulta inside of Target stores. How did you get here? Talk to us about your career path.KECIA STEELMAN: Yeah, I would say through hard work and a lot of mentorship along the way. I did start at Target in the early days making $8 an hour on the sales floor, and I could not be more proud of our partnership with Ulta Beauty at Target. It was a full-circle moment for me.I'm blessed that I started my career at such a great retailer. They invested a lot in my leadership and my education and the skills to really do the job that you need to do in retail today. So very thankful for that, the early years at Target.And then just continue to grow in my experience. And I'm a big believer in the answers are in the stores. So you mentioned that you follow me on Instagram, and I'm in the stores a lot. You know, the answers are on the front lines with our associates. And when we listen to them and we're taking care of their needs and helping them do their jobs better, it really translates to the guests, and the guests will spend more with us.So you know, I would say it's been a great journey. I feel very blessed and fortunate to have worked with such great retailers, but I think I'm with one of the very best today here at Ulta Beauty.SEANA SMITH: Ulta Beauty CEO Kecia Steelman. And, of course, our thanks to Brian Sozzi as well.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Ulta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.76, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.76 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ULTABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ULTACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Ulta here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Ulta, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers — 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is ULTA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Ulta, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.8% over the past month to $25.21.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ulta. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Ulta may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Textron (NYSE:TXT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Textron:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.088 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$16b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Textron has an ROCE of 8.8%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 9.4%, it's still a low return by itself. Check out our latest analysis for Textron roceIn the above chart we have measured Textron's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?There hasn't been much to report for Textron's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Textron in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.The Bottom LineWe can conclude that in regards to Textron's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And with the stock having returned a mere 20% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesIf you're still interested in Textron it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While Textron isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Valued at $30.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by January 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure eight P-8A aircraft mechanisms as ancillary equipment to support P-8A aircraft production.The work related to this deal will be carried out in Seattle, WA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. The company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is a testament to that. Such order flows should boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like South America, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global defense aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during 2021-2026, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. It also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Story continuesNOC has a long-term earnings growth of 3.5%.

The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs, boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022.Lockheed Martin has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in backlog till December 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the aforementioned business segment.LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT, which are also expected to gain from the abovementioned market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +13.3%.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.81bUS$11.2bUS$11.8bUS$12.3bUS$12.7bUS$13.1bUS$13.5bUS$13.8bUS$14.2bUS$14.5bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Est @ 4.19%Est @ 3.55%Est @ 3.11%Est @ 2.80%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.43%Est @ 2.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$9.2kUS$9.8kUS$9.7kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$8.8kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$88bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$312bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$312b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$161bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$249b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$61.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Coca-ColaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

336,62213ab5-3694-3d22-9154-3299f20a8244,KO,2023-03-29,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-attracting-investor-130001366.html,1680008401,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 points to a change of +4.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.79 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $10.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.4%. The $44.82 billion and $47.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.2% and +5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.13 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7%. EPS of $0.45 for the same period compares with $0.45 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy Now. On January 11, 2023, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which is the fund division of Goldman Sachs, disclosed that it raised $1.6 billion for its initial private equity fund that concentrates on investing in companies offering solutions to environmental and climate issues. The completion of the Horizon Environment &amp; Climate Solutions I fund happens as investors are increasingly focusing on companies that can aid in the global battle against climate change. Launched in 2021, the fund provides growth capital to firms that have progressed in creating solutions in areas such as clean energy, sustainable transportation, waste management, sustainable food and agriculture, and ecosystem services. Waste management is a rapidly growing industry. In 2020, the worldwide waste management market was valued at $1,612.0 billion, and it is projected to grow to $2,483.0 billion by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% from 2021 to 2030. Waste management pertains to the gathering, moving, and proper disposal of garbage, sewage, and other types of waste materials. It encompasses the treatment of solid waste and the safe and effective elimination of unwanted substances and products. Moreover, there is a growing trend of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) enabled devices like robots for the purpose of categorizing and separating waste materials resulting from demolitions and debris, and generating high-quality and valuable materials from mixed construction and demolition waste. This presents profitable growth prospects for significant industry players. In addition, significant investments in research and development efforts are anticipated to create a favorable market outlook.Some of the best waste management stocks to buy in order to benefit from the industry traction include Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), and Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN). Story continuesOur Methodology We chose the top waste management stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 11 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy NowOlaf Speier/Shutterstock.comBest Waste Management Stocks to Buy Now11. Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) is an American company that specializes in environmental solutions and technology. Its operations are divided into two segments – Treatment and Services. The Treatment segment provides a range of services, including the treatment and disposal of nuclear waste, low-level radioactive waste, mixed waste, hazardous waste, and non-hazardous waste. Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)’s fourth-quarter revenue was $16.757 million, which is slightly lower than the $17.116 million reported in the previous year. The CEO of the company, Mark Duff, acknowledged that the year 2022 was challenging due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused delays in projects in both the Treatment and Services Segments. However, he expressed optimism about Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI)’s future growth prospects. He noted that the Treatment Segment had seen a gradual improvement in waste receipts, particularly in the last nine months of 2022, with average receipts per quarter steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 6 hedge funds were long Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI), compared to 4 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest position holder in the company. Like Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG), and Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN), Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) is one of the best waste management stocks to watch. Here is what Long Cast Advisers has to say about Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:PESI) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“PESI is another stock that has been a drag on results for the quarter and year, despite the fact that it’s undergoing a remarkable turnaround partially masked by COVID related issues.The Treatment segment (left chart) is an asset-heavy processor of low-level nuclear waste – mostly derived from the cleanup of soils and machinery at closed federal facilities – at four locations in the US. This business makes money on the capacity utilization of its facilities; as long as the machines are running and the waste is flowing the business generates 15%-20% OpInc margins. The Services segment (right chart) does “boots on the ground” type work which it bids and conducts similar to a construction project, (though it’s more likely deconstruction). This segment was stagnant under prior management but has been rejuvenated under the current CEO Mark Duff, who joined the company in 2016 and was promoted in 2017.The large decline in Treatment mirrors the large COVID-related decline in waste shipments across the country. A data point that’s illustrative of the decline: At YTD 3Q19, ~760k cubic feet of waste was disposed of at a variety of federal facilities and cleanup sites nationwide. At YTD 3Q20, that dropped to ~380k cubic feet. (A keen observer of these links might notice significant growth at the Perma-Fix facility at TN, but that’s the result of an acquisition in Feb 2020 of a high volume low margin sorting facility.) As a result of declining waste shipments nationwide, margins in the normally stable Treatment segment have collapsed and ~$2M in quarterly operating profit has temporarily disappeared.The cumulative effect of the temporary decline on high margin Treatment concurrent with growth in lower margin Services makes it appear as if the company is experiencing decremental margins or “running to stay in place”, likely why the company gets no credit for the improvement at Services. At some point, Treatment will come back, growth in Services will be additive and I think shareholders will be rewarded.The stock trades for about 12x TTM EBITDA, slightly above the peer group, but this is against an EBITDA figure that’s understated by ~$3M due to the aforementioned temporary factors. Adjusting for these factors, it’s trading at 8x “normalized” EBITDA. When the environment re-normalizes, we should see the full benefit of the turnaround in Services + improved results in Treatment. None of this even remotely considers some of the large federal cleanup projects on which the company is actively bidding.”10. Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) provides waste management solutions for recycling, reusing, and disposing of various types of waste and recyclable materials throughout the United States. The company's services include disposal and recycling of different types of waste such as motor oil and automotive lubricants, oil filters, scrap tires, oily water, goods destruction, food waste, meat renderings, plastics, cardboard, metal, glass, construction debris, and a wide range of regulated and non-regulated solid, liquid, and gas wastes. It is one of the best waste management stocks to invest in. On April 18, EF Hutton analyst Chip Moore initiated coverage of Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) with a Buy rating and a $13 price target. Quest is a major provider of waste and recycling solutions across the United States, and according to the analyst, the company is distinct from its competitors due to its national footprint and asset-light approach. Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) is also able to handle a wide range of waste streams, making it a comprehensive solution for customers. Additionally, Moore noted that the company has developed valuable data warehousing capabilities, which allow it to offer full visibility of waste streams to its clients.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 8 hedge funds were bullish on Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC), compared to 9 funds in the earlier quarter. Nelson Obus’ Wynnefield Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth $15.70 million. Here is what Long Cast Advisor specifically said about Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC)  in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:QRHC) borrowed heavily to purchase Rome RWS, Inc., and with results from the acquired company not yet fully on the income statement, the debt ratios expanded and equity valuations declined. Management – and really the Board – is undertaking a high skill maneuver of integrating its largest acquisition to date, carrying an unprecedented level of debt all concurrent with the long planned retirement of the long tenured CFO. It’s a little more exciting than necessary but the valuation is undemanding and the opportunity set quite large.Since I’ve long written about what this company could look like if it leaned more deeply into utilizing technology within its two-sided marketplace, I’ll be closely following the XPO Logistics (XPO) spinoff of the truck brokerage business, expected in 4Q22. Truck and waste brokerage share some similar dynamics and as I’ve long noted, the technologist at XPO worked at Oakleaf concurrently with QRHC CEO Ray Hatch. Technology was a big enabling factor at Oakleaf and in XPO’s +10x growth. I think it would have a similar function for QRHC were management to wisely invest time and resources in its development.”9. Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) is an environmental services company in the United States and internationally. The company operates in three segments – Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis, and Remediation and Reuse. It is one of the top waste management stocks to watch. On February 10, Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) revealed that it has acquired Environmental Alliance, which is an environmental engineering and consulting firm situated in the Mid-Atlantic region.On March 2, JPMorgan analyst Stephanie Yee downgraded Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) from Overweight to Neutral, and reduced its price target to $39 from $48. The analyst cited the company's Q4 results and guidance as being below expectations. Yee believes that Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) can achieve organic growth at a relatively high rate, but only when excluding the more volatile CTEH segment. However, the analyst noted that the company's operating leverage appears to be limited in the near term.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 8 hedge funds were bullish on Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG), with collective stakes worth $57 million. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 452,302 shares worth $20 million.Alger Weatherbie Specialized Growth Fund made the following comment about Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Montrose Environmental Group, Inc. (NYSE:MEG) offers various environmental services to a diverse client base, primarily in the U.S. The company has expertise in a wide variety of areas, including environmental assessment and permitting, measurement and analysis, and remediation and reuse. During the period, the company reported solid organic growth with particular strength in areas such as Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), biogas and GHG measurement. Moreover, management noted that they are not seeing a change in customer behavior or buying patterns despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company also noted that momentum continues to build in their favor on the regulatory front, with recent EPA proposals and state level regulations being introduced.”8. Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) caters to small and medium-sized customers in the industrial and vehicle maintenance sectors in North America. They offer services such as parts cleaning, hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal, and used oil collection. In addition, Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI)’s Environmental Services division provides containerized waste management, industrial and field services, antifreeze recycling, emergency and spill response, wastewater vacuum, and parts cleaning.Kevin Steinke, an analyst at Barrington, increased the target price on Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) shares from $45 to $46 and maintained an Outperform rating on March 14. The company's Q4 2022 results surpassed expectations, with revenue rising by 42.2% year-over-year to $241.1 million, exceeding the firm's estimated $223.4 million and the consensus of $225.5 million. According to the analyst, the recent acquisition of Patriot Environmental Services, which was finalized on August 3, 2022, contributed 21.6 percentage points to growth. Consequently, the organic revenue growth for Q4 2022 was 20.6%.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 14 hedge funds were long Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI), compared to 19 funds in the last quarter.

Carlo Cannell’s Cannell Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 800,137 shares worth approximately $26 million. Meridian Funds made the following comment about Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc (NASDAQ:HCCI) is an environmental services company focused on machine parts cleaning, used oil collection, oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services. Our rationale for investing in this company includes the recurring revenue stream it generates from its environmental services business unit and substantial growth opportunities in the re-refinery and used oil collection segments. Continued strong execution and higher oil prices contributed to the stock’s solid performance during the period. Notably, Heritage-Crystal Clean’s oil business segment generated record revenue in the second quarter and saw segment margins improve to 41%, as the spread between base oil sales and the cost of collecting used oil widened. The company’s core environmental services segment also recorded record quarterly revenue. We believe the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) story at Heritage remains underappreciated by the market as the company collects used motor oil and recycles it for reuse. We have high conviction in the long-term growth story for the company, but trimmed our position in the stock during the period as the share price appreciated.”7. Li-Cycle Holdings Corp.

344,eae0aacc-1ac4-367e-869f-aef53664fdd5,GE,2023-03-29,GE (GE) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-ge-considered-good-investment-133001072.html,1680010201,STORY,['GE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.3% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is GE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.9% over the past month to $1.97.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PetroMasila is a Yemeni state-owned company that explores and produces oil in Yemen.Per the deal, General Electric will supply a trailer-mounted GE TM2500 aero-derivative gas turbine, also called a “power plant on wheels.” It will be positioned at Block 14 in the Hadramout region. The gas turbine unit will be able to supply electricity of a maximum of 34 megawatts (MW) at the site’s conditions.It will be fueled by previously flared associated gas to support PetroMasila’s oil exploration and extraction processes — generating power from extra gas. When connected to the local grid, more than 50% of the electricity produced from the unit at Block 14 will be supplied to the grid. This will cater to the power requirement of the Yemeni homes that presently don’t have access to electricity.This deal will aid PetroMasila to achieve its power generation goals by using previously flared associated gas and end the use of diesel, which is a higher emitting and costly fuel. General Electric’s remote monitoring and diagnostic system will also ensure seamless operations.General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteThe power plant on wheels is likely to begin commercial operation in 2023. In 2022, three TM2500 gas turbines were also installed at Block 10 in the East Shabwa region of Yemen, replacing diesel generators.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderGE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In addition, AM Best has assigned indicative Long-Term IRs of ""a-"" (Excellent) to subordinated issues, ""bbb+"" (Good) to preferred stock and ""a"" (Excellent) to senior unsecured issues of the recently filed shelf registration to UnitedHealth Group. The outlook assigned to these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. Concurrently, AM Best has withdrawn the ratings on the previous shelf registrations. UnitedHealth Group’s Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating of ""a"" (Excellent), its Long-Term IRs and the ratings of its insurance subsidiaries are unchanged.The proceeds from the debt issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing short-term debt that was used to finance the LHC Group Inc. (LHC) acquisition, valued at approximately $6 billion including the retirement of LHC debt, which closed early this year. The LHC acquisition will strengthen UnitedHealth Group’s home health services. Following the repayment of commercial paper and upcoming maturities, AM Best anticipates the issuance to increase the group’s adjusted financial leverage ratio approximately 44%. However, UnitedHealth Group has managed to bring its financial leverage down to the 40% range over time taking active actions to deleverage following sizeable acquisitions. As of Dec. 31, 2022, the group’s financial leverage was 41.4%. The organization maintains strong earnings before interest and taxes interest coverage in the low double digits. UnitedHealth Group has excellent liquidity through parent company cash, insurance subsidiary dividend capacity, non-regulated cash flow, commercial paper program and a $18 billion revolving credit agreement. A steady stream of revenue development and earnings growth have resulted in a solid operating performance trend over the past several years underpinned by UnitedHealth Group’s operations at UnitedHealthcare and at Optum. The organization expects this growth to continue over the medium term.Story continuesThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for LKQ The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$993.3mUS$1.01bUS$1.09bUS$1.14bUS$1.16bUS$1.18bUS$1.21bUS$1.23bUS$1.26bUS$1.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 1.87%Est @ 1.93%Est @ 1.97%Est @ 2.00%Est @ 2.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$916US$861US$854US$823US$774US$727US$683US$642US$604US$568(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.5bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.1%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$9.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$16b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$54.4, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LKQ as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.079. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LKQStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Retail Distributors industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Retail Distributors market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Coty has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Estee Lauder has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that COTY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.COTY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 31.55, while EL has a forward P/E of 48.69. We also note that COTY has a PEG ratio of 2.14. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EL currently has a PEG ratio of 5.30.Another notable valuation metric for COTY is its P/B ratio of 2.68. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EL has a P/B of 14.64.Based on these metrics and many more, COTY holds a Value grade of B, while EL has a Value grade of D.Story continuesCOTY sticks out from EL in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that COTY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SLG recently signed a long-term lease covering an entire tower floor at its One Madison Avenue with Palo Alto Networks, a leader in global cybersecurity. The move reflects the decent demand for SLG’s high-quality and well-amenetized office properties.With this lease, SL Green’s signed office leasing volume for 2023 totaled 491,913 square feet. Moreover, the company’s office leasing pipeline increased to more than 1 million square feet from 700,000 square feet within just three weeks.The transformational development at One Madison Avenue, spanning 1.4 million square feet, is scheduled to be completed in October 2023 and is 59% leased at present. As part of this development, One Madison Avenue will combine the elegance of the existing limestone building with more than 500,000 square feet of new, virtually column-free construction.Per Steven Durels, SL Green’s executive vice president, director of leasing and real property, “The building’s continued leasing momentum is indicative of high performing companies’ ongoing desire for high-quality, centrally-located, collaborative office space.”With state-of-the-art infrastructure, forward-thinking amenities and a cutting-edge healthy work environment, the property is set to provide the highest standard for the present-day workplace. This is expected to help attract more tenants at Manhattan’s largest office landlord’s property, poising it well for growth.One Madison Avenue will feature a spectacular 10,000 square feet roof deck with lush landscaping, a 7,000 square feet tenant-only amenity space, an upscale French steakhouse and artisanal European style market operated by Michelin-starred Chef Daniel Boulud, and a 54,000 square feet Chelsea Piers Fitness club.The flight-to-quality preference of office tenants has been aiding SL Green’s leasing activity for its premier office properties located mainly in the high-barrier-to-entry real estate market of New York. During the fourth quarter of 2022, it signed 33 office leases for its Manhattan portfolio encompassing 196,421 square feet.Moreover, SLG’s opportunistic investment policy and solid balance-sheet strength position it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Nonetheless, a choppy office market environment could soften the demand for the company’s properties, hurting leasing volume in the near term. Also, the elevated supply of office properties in certain markets adds to the company’s concerns.Rising interest rates are likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting SLG’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 38.8% in the past three months, underperforming its industry’s decline of 4.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities ARE and Terreno Realty TRNO, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and Service Properties Trust SVC, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

HA subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, announced that it entered a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sales agreement with biofuel company Gevo, Inc. Per the deal, Hawaiian Airlines will purchase 50 million gallons of SAF over five years. Gevo is anticipated to supply SAF from a facility to be constructed in the Midwestern United States and shall start deliveries to Hawaiian Holdings’ gateway cities in California in 2029.This deal is subject to certain conditions, which include Gevo developing, financing and constructing the facility to produce SAF (as mentioned in the deal).Gevo will generate SAF with the help of residual starch from inedible field corn (grown using regenerative farming practices). The production process will use renewable electricity and renewable natural gas, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity.Notably, Gevo aims to work in a way that maximizes value and reduces waste generation. It is done using the same portion of farmland to produce both animal feed and renewable fuels, while sequestering atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis.Peter Ingram, Hawaiian Holdings' president and chief executive officer, stated, ""This offtake agreement gets us one step closer to achieving our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."" He further added, ""We intend to continue to invest in SAF, which will be pivotal in reducing our impact on the environment.""The reopening of the global economy and no travel-related restrictions post COVID-19 led to the buoyancy in air-travel demand. Hence, the fuel sales agreement to decarbonize the aviation industry through the SAF advancement should boost Hawaiian Holdings’ competitive position in the aviation industry.Currently, Hawaiian Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation – Airline industry can consider Copa Holdings, S.A.

361,10b7f3e7-5399-362d-9695-c5ed8c750e1f,LNT,2023-03-29,The total return for Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-alliant-energy-nasdaq-120128094.html,1680004888,STORY,['LNT'],"[When you buy and hold a stock for the long term, you definitely want it to provide a positive return. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT) share price is up 26% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 17% in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Alliant Energy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Alliant Energy achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.6% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Alliant Energy's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Alliant Energy's TSR for the last 5 years was 46%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlliant Energy shareholders are down 15% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -14%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Alliant Energy (1 is potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.But note: Alliant Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

In addition to this, by having multiple businesses, companies can generate revenue from different sources, which stabilizes their revenue streams. This can be particularly beneficial in times of economic uncertainty or when one industry or sector is facing challenges. Through multiple businesses, these companies often have strong balance sheets and solid cash flow generation even during volatile times.After recording one of its worst performances in history last year, the stock market was on the road to recovery in 2023. However, the recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse has shaken investors’ confidence in the stock market. A monthly survey conducted by BofA through its self-compiled ‘Financial Market Risk Indicator’ after the fallout of SVB showed that investor worry levels have risen to 7.7, just a little below extreme highs of last year amid the Ukraine War. This financial instability has made investors explore different investment options, with dividend strategies gaining traction over other asset classes.According to analysts, companies with strong cash flow should be investors’ focus as they pay stable dividends to shareholders. Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, spoke with Barron’s about dividend stocks and the importance of cash flow. He said:“Many dividend payers have strong balance sheets and lower leverage, and the sustainability of the dividend isn’t in question unless we get a really deep downturn.”He further added that investors should avoid companies with a lot of debt and turn their attention toward those who are able to smoothly cover their payouts by free cash flow.Story continuesPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are some companies that have raised their payouts for a long period of time and have strong cash flow generation. Companies like these can provide a reliable source of income and can also help to mitigate the effects of market volatility.

Events soon overtook this commentary insofar as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners announced that it had bought a stake in Unilever and he was invited to join the board. We are asked to suspend disbelief that this was in no way linked to the subsequent announcement that Alan Jope will be leaving the CEO role. This explanation sounds like it was lifted from the script of Miracle on 34th Street.As I have previously pointed out, our Fund has held Unilever shares since inception and was about the 12th largest shareholder when these events happened. Yet for the first eight years of our existence as a shareholder we did not hear from Unilever. The first contact was when we were asked to vote in favour of moving the headquarters and listing to the Netherlands. As I remarked at the time, it is not a good way to manage relationships to ignore people until you need their support…” (Click here to read the full text)10. Emerson Electric Co.

365,47d09545-9869-3071-99c8-fe12efc59930,PEP,2023-03-29,Is It Worth Investing in PepsiCo (PEP) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-pepsico-pep-based-133001373.html,1680010201,STORY,['PEP'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PepsiCo (PEP) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PEP Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.23.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression. This includes patients that have no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations and whose tumors are metastatic or locally advanced and not candidates for definitive chemoradiation.“Today’s approval considerably expands the number of people in Europe with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are eligible for Libtayo-based first-line treatment, including those with PD-L1 expression ranges most commonly seen in real-world practice,” said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. “We are proud that Libtayo continues to distinguish itself among PD-1 pathway blockers, as just one of two PD-1 inhibitors to be approved for use across squamous and non-squamous forms of advanced NSCLC in both combination and monotherapy settings. This marks the fifth approval for Libtayo in Europe.”Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, more than 2.2 million annual new cases have been diagnosed globally. Approximately 80-85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, with 75% of these cases diagnosed in advanced stages.“The Phase 3 EMPOWER-Lung 3 trial showed significant improvements across primary and key secondary endpoints, including overall survival in the cemiplimab plus chemotherapy arm,” said Prof. Martin Reck, Head of Department of Thoracic Oncology, Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany. “As a treating physician of this patient population, I welcome a new treatment option for patients in Europe, as we continue to strive for better outcomes for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.”Story continues“With lung cancer being the leading cause of cancer mortality globally, ongoing research is imperative to find more treatment options for people impacted by this disease,” said Anne-Marie Baird, Ph.D., President, Lung Cancer Europe. “This approval highlights continued progress in first-line treatment options for people impacted by advanced lung cancer in Europe.”Libtayo is currently approved in the EU and other countries for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), advanced NSCLC and advanced cervical cancer. The Libtayo combination was also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression in November 2022.About the Phase 3 TrialThe EC approval is based on data from the global Phase 3 EMPOWER-Lung 3 trial, a randomized, multicenter trial investigating a first-line combination treatment of Libtayo and platinum-doublet chemotherapy (Libtayo combination), compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone. The trial enrolled 466 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as well as squamous or non-squamous histologies across all PD-L1 expression levels and with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations. Notably, the trial was designed to closely resemble a patient population with varied disease presentations seen in everyday clinical practice. Among those enrolled, 43% had tumors with squamous histology, 15% had locally advanced disease and 7% had a history of brain metastases.Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Libtayo 350 mg (n=312) or placebo (n=154) administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 108 weeks, plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The trial was stopped early based on a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee after the Libtayo combination demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS). Results of the trial at the primary analysis were published in Nature Medicine in August 2022.At the primary analysis (median follow-up: 16 months), the trial showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of OS for patients treated with the Libtayo combination compared to chemotherapy alone in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 to 0.93). Among the 70% of patients in the trial expressing PD-L1 ≥1% (n=327), efficacy results for the Libtayo combination arm (n=217) compared to chemotherapy alone (n=110) showed a:22-month median OS versus 13 months, representing a 45% relative reduction in the risk of death (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.78).9-month median progression-free survival (PFS) versus 6 months (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.63)48% objective response rate (ORR) versus 23%16-month median duration of response (DOR; range: 2 to 19+) versus 5 months (range: 2 to 19+)At the time of the pre-specified final analysis (median follow up: 28 months), patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% treated with the Libtayo combination continued to show clinically meaningful survival and PFS benefits compared to chemotherapy alone.Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue during or after treatment with Libtayo. Among patients treated with the Libtayo combination evaluated for safety in the trial (n=312), adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% included anemia (44%), alopecia (37%), musculoskeletal pain (27%), nausea (25%), fatigue (23%), peripheral neuropathy (21%), hyperglycemia (18%), decreased appetite (17%), alanine aminotransferase increased (16%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (15%), neutropenia (15%), constipation (14%), dyspnoea (13%), rash (13%), thrombocytopenia (13%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (11%), insomnia (11%), weight decreased (11%) and hypoalbuminemia (10%). Adverse reactions were serious in 25% of patients and led to permanent discontinuation of the Libtayo combination in 5% of patients.In December 2022, Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy was added to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (score: 4 out of 5), for patients with advanced NSCLC across squamous and non-squamous histologies, and irrespective of PD-1 expression levels.About Regeneron in OncologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer.

The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and its tactical approaches to accelerate growth also buoy optimism. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and a soft volume environment are major downsides.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 1.4% compared with the 23.6% decline of the industry and the 15.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of diagnostic information services has a market capitalization of $15.52 billion. The company projects 1.8% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Quest Diagnostics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 7.01%, on average.Let’s delve deeper.Q4 Upsides: Quest Diagnostics reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenues. During the reported quarter, the base business registered growth and the company also ramped up investments to accelerate growth in the base business, particularly in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In advanced diagnostics, the company generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services and launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test.To help offset inflationary pressures, it has continued to pursue its operational excellence strategy and has been closely managing the cost structure through the company’s invigorate initiatives.Base Volume Improves: Quest Diagnostics’ base testing volumes or base business refers to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. During the reported quarter, base business revenue was up 8.9%. The company is increasing efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in the base business. The company continued to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. In the fourth quarter, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts within health plans. The company started benefiting from incentives related to these value-based contracts, which helped demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAccelerate Growth Strategy Bodes Well: Quest Diagnostics continues to progress in terms of its tactical approaches to accelerate growth, the first part of its two-point strategy, raising our optimism. In terms of growth through M&amp;A, the company has announced an outreach lab purchase from Ohio-based Summa Health. Quest Diagnostics has also announced a professional lab services relationship with Southwest Florida-based Lee Health to provide supply-chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee Health and selected outpatient centers.To accelerate growth through health plan access, the company continued to gain traction with value-based contracts, where it sees higher growth than traditional contracts.DownsidesStiff Competition: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from other commercial laboratories and hospitals. Hospitals control an estimated 60% of the diagnostic test market, compared to Quest Diagnostic’s 15% share. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs primarily based on the quality of service.Soft Volume Environment: Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, was down 11.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. Revenues per requisition declined 5.1% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volume.Estimate TrendQuest Diagnostics has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 2.6% north to $8.68.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $8.96 billion, suggesting a 9.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. For example, the Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price return of 25% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Disappointingly, the share price is down 8.3% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Cisco Systems was able to grow its EPS at 2.3% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 8% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Cisco Systems' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Cisco Systems the TSR over the last 3 years was 38%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Cisco Systems shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 5.3% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 14%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - Cisco Systems has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Building on advanced AI capabilities already available in Cisco Collaboration devices today, Webex is expanding its video-intelligence in its devices through conference room operating system Cisco Room OS. Users will benefit from the ability to automatically provide the most optimal views in any meeting, at any moment, in any space with new capabilities that deliver:Story continuesCinematic meeting experiences: With cinematic meetings on Cisco Collaboration devices, cameras follow individuals through voice and facial recognition, automatically switching views to capture the best angle of the active speaker. This benefits people in the room with immaculate focus on the speaker, and hybrid workers not in the meeting room will feel included even if they are not physically in the room.Meeting zones: With this capability, IT admins can set virtual boundaries for any collaboration space in the office, turning it into a meeting zone. With meeting zones, people are individually framed in a condensed view – leaving any blank space out of the view. Only people that are inside defined boundaries are included in the meeting. This is critical in busy open spaces and in conference rooms with glass walls, to eliminate the distraction of people outside the meeting.Optimizing Collaboration In today's hybrid world, organizations must provide employees with flexibility in when, where, and how they work – which requires technology that best optimizes collaboration. As a testament to Webex Calling's ability to deliver the flexible hybrid work technologies organizations need, it's reached a new milestone of connecting over 10 million users, nearly doubling year-over-year growth. To further optimize collaboration, Cisco is introducing new AI capabilities in the Webex Suite, including: High-definition (HD) meetings that don't require HD bandwidth: Webex's Super Resolution ensures crystal clear video in Webex meetings, even with low-quality cameras or low bandwidth conditions.Smart re-lighting: To ensure people look their best in any environment, smart re-lighting automatically improves poor lighting when it's too dim or bright. For example, when working outside on a sunny day, the appearance of underexposed video is adjusted so the person appears more clearly.Automatic ""be right back"" update: This capability automatically puts up a BRB message, blurs the background and mutes audio when a user steps away from a Webex meeting. For example, if your doorbell rings and you leave a meeting to pick up a delivery. The BRB message is automatically removed once the user returns.Maximizing Customer Experience  Customer expectations are at an all-time high, and organizations have billions of interactions with customers daily. It's become impossible for agents and legacy systems to keep up with the volume, velocity, and disparity of interactions and the personalization required to address this. Cisco leverages its same market-leading technology required for Hybrid Work to fuel its Webex customer experience solutions.Today, Cisco is unveiling its vision of the self-learning contact center. Cisco is also introducing new AI capabilities for its customer experience solutions, spanning Webex Contact Center and its cloud communications platform, Webex Connect. These new capabilities include:Actionable insights for improved CX: Topic Analysis in Webex Contact Center surfaces key reasons customers are calling into the contact center. It aggregates call transcript data from the contact center and models trends succinctly for business analysts, so they can proactively adapt to meet the needs of customers. This capability is self-learning, constantly getting smarter from customer interactions.Agent Answers as a real-time agent coach: With this capability, learnings from both self-service and automated customer interactions are fed back into the self-learning contact center to increase human agents' effectiveness. Agent Answers listens and acts as a real-time coach for the human agent, surfacing knowledge base articles and helpful information the agent can instantly provide the customer.Automated chat summaries for agents: AI-powered chat summaries eliminate the need for agents to read lengthy digital chat histories with customers to determine issues and resolutions already explored. Agents will benefit from a faster, automated way to consume long-form text from customer chats and provide key takeaways in a quickly digestible format.Automated code for rapid customization of customer journeys: Today, Webex's low-code flow builder capability in Webex Connect already helps businesses orchestrate and automate end-to-end customer journeys. Now, users will be able to simply describe the function they want to perform, such as ""validate an email address,"" and AI will generate and return the appropriate code instantly. This makes it easier to create and iterate customer journeys quickly.New Webex AI capabilities are expected to roll out over the course of 2023.
