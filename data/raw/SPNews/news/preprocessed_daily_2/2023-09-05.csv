The industry loss estimate includes estimated wind damage and insured estimates of storm surge across Idalia’s track. A majority of the losses will be from damage due to wind. At around 7:45 a.m. EDT on August 30, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Taylor County within Florida’s Big Bend region, near Keaton Beach, as a Category 3 hurricane.While Idalia made landfall in a sparsely populated region of Florida, catastrophic damage was observed in small communities like Perry, which took the brunt of the storm’s fierce western eyewall shortly after landfall, and Cedar Key, which experienced historic storm surge inundation. Fortunately, Tallahassee was largely spared from the worst as the storm’s center passed 60 miles to the east and saw three inches of rainfall and wind gusts into the 40s mph. Idalia’s forward speed brought the then Category 1 storm over the state boundary into Georgia near Valdosta. Significant damage was observed in Valdosta, where remnants of the western eyewall deluged the area with six inches of rain and brought powerful winds. As a result, widespread flooding and considerable structural and roof damage ensued. Idalia’s northeast track led the storm offshore in the early morning of August 31. While located offshore, Idalia brought tropical storm-force winds, heavy rain and powerful surf to the North Carolina coast.Wind and storm surge damageWind damage in varying degrees was observed in all the areas impacted by Hurricane Idalia’s wind field. Damage was more severe in and around the areas where Idalia made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida, including Taylor and Suwanee counties. It ranged from significant loss of roof covers in residential homes to torn-up roof membranes in commercial structures. Story continuesVarying levels of damage inflicted by fallen trees was observed along the path of Idalia. Cities including Tallahassee, Gainesville, Jacksonville, FL and Valdosta, Savannah, GA are reporting a large number of downed trees. This area is dominated by large pine trees, and these can lead to costly cleanup costs, roof replacements and associated costs. A similar phenomenon was seen in the aftermath of 2018’s Hurricane Michael in the city of Tallahassee where losses in excess of $1B were seen and driven primarily by tree-related damage. However, Hurricane Michael was much stronger than Idalia in its closest approach to Tallahassee. Manufactured homes constitute a significant portion of the residential inventory in the Big Bend region of Florida where Idalia made landfall. Several manufactured homes in these areas saw massive damage, including loss of roofs, damage to wall siding and near-total destruction due to wind and surge alike, the latter in coastal areas. Storm surge produced significant damage in the coastal neighborhoods of Keaton Beach, Steinhatchee, Horseshoe Beach and Cedar Key, FL. Manufactured homes were washed away due to the dynamic impact of fast-moving coastal surge. Residential homes founded on slabs saw significant water-related damage to various building components and contents. Beachfront homes elevated on piles/stilts performed relatively well. Flooding along the waterfront areas was reported in and around Tampa, St. Petersburg, FL and Charleston, SC. How building codes are reflected in the damageThe Big Bend region of Florida where Idalia made landfall, has the lowest design winds statewide, between 120 and 130 mph.Areas along the coast and inland are excluded from the wind-borne debris region, which means opening protection and stronger opening requirements are not required in the buildings in this region. The same is true for southwestern parts of Georgia that experienced strong winds from Idalia.  A major hurricane similar to Idalia has not impacted this region for over 125 years, since the unnamed hurricane in 1896. A significant portion of the building inventory along the track of Hurricane Idalia predate the International Codes, i.e., are built prior to the year 2000. Owing to the aforementioned factors, the damage is expected to be severe in the vicinity of landfall. Relative to last year’s Hurricane Ian, Idalia has impacted far fewer buildings, meaning the overall stresses on the construction industry should be far less as rebuilding gets underway in the coming weeks and months.Verisk’s modeled insured loss estimates do include:Losses to onshore residential, commercial and industrial properties and automobiles for their building, contents and time element coverageImpact of demand surgeVerisk’s modeled insured loss estimates do not include:Losses paid out by the National Flood Insurance ProgramLosses exacerbated by litigation, fraudulent assignment of benefits or social inflationStorm surge leakage losses paid on wind only policies due to government interventionLosses from precipitation-induced floodingLosses to inland marine, ocean-going marine cargo and hull and pleasure boatsLosses to uninsured propertiesLosses to infrastructureLosses from extra-contractual obligationsLosses from hazardous waste cleanup, vandalism or civil commotion, whether directly or indirectly caused by the eventLosses resulting from the compromise of existing defenses (e.g., natural and man-made levees)Loss adjustment expensesOther non-modeled losses, including those resulting from tornadoes spawned by the stormLosses for U.S. offshore assets and non-U.S. property###About Verisk Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Texas Instruments' current trading price of US$170 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Texas Instruments’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Is Texas Instruments Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Texas Instruments is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $233.94, but it is currently trading at US$170 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Texas Instruments’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Texas Instruments look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 16% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Texas Instruments. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TXN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TXN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

It has recently witnessed a surge of 2.13%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 17.94%. However, fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance.

WDC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WDCWestern Digital Corp (WDC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 5/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 1/105. Momentum rank: 8/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Western Digital Corp the GF Score of 60 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: Western Digital CorpWestern Digital Corp, with a market cap of $14.79 billion, is a leading vertically integrated supplier of data storage solutions, spanning both hard disk drives and solid-state drives. In the HDD market, it forms a practical duopoly with Seagate, and it is the largest global producer of NAND flash chips for SSDs in a joint venture with competitor Kioxia. Despite its significant sales of $12.32 billion, the company has an operating margin of -8.87%, indicating potential challenges in profitability.Story continuesWestern Digital Corp (WDC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisWestern Digital Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company has an interest coverage ratio of 0, which positions it worse than 0% of 1595 companies in the Hardware industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 1.58, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.29 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Western Digital Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -11.6 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 84.42% of 2317 companies in the Hardware industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Western Digital Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Western Digital Corp (WDC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Western Digital Corp has a strong market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future.

4,c8c3669e-747c-3675-b6a7-895e54a29b24,NUE,2023-09-05,Cleveland-Cliffs' bid to keep US blast furnaces smelting,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-inside-cleveland-cliffs-bid-100000026.html,1693908000,STORY,"['X', 'STLD', 'NG=F', 'CLF', 'NUE']","[High costs and environmental opposition have prevented the construction of blast furnaces at steel mills in the United States since 1980. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc CEO Lourenco Goncalves is on a mission to snap up all that are left.Since joining the U.S. steelmaker in 2014 as part of an activist hedge fund's board takeover, Goncalves has made blast furnaces a hallmark of his strategy, positioning Cliffs as an outlier in an industry shifting towards cheaper and more environmentally friendly electric arc furnaces.A 65-year-old Brazilian metallurgical engineer, Goncalves transformed Cliffs from an iron ore and coal miner into the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America by acquiring companies that own blast furnaces to smelt the pig iron it produces.Now, he has his sights on acquiring U.S. Steel Corp, the other remaining U.S. blast furnace operator, which has been gradually moving into electric arc furnaces, known as mini-mills. Should his $7.3 billion cash-and-stock bid prevail, Cliffs would break into the world's top 10 steel producers, which are mostly from Asia.Interviews with six people close to the companies and industry insiders, as well a review of regulatory filings, show Goncalves' bet on blast furnaces has yet to pay off, and its success hinges on pulling off the deal with U.S. Steel.This is because blast furnaces operate around the clock and need more workers. They are more expensive to run when they have to be stopped and restarted to account for changes in demand, as often happens with the automotive sector.To compensate for that cost, they need a dominant market share so they can charge more for their steel. To build a market position, Cliffs acquired AK Steel for $3 billion and ArcelorMittal's U.S. operations for $3.3 billion in 2020. Cliffs focused on dominating production of U.S.-made steel used in the external panels of cars, which require quality that electric arc furnaces currently cannot achieve.Story continues""By increasing market share, Goncalves has a much more commanding position where he can charge more,"" said Josh Spoores, principal analyst at CRU Group, a business intelligence firm that provides analysis on global metals and mining.Goncalves is also betting that producing iron ore in-house for blast furnaces, rather than sourcing scrap steel for electric arc furnaces, will give Cliffs a competitive edge. So far, the nimbler electric arc furnaces have remained cheaper to run, amid fluctuations in demand for steel.Cliffs' gross margin was 11% last year, down from 35% in 2018, when it focused on iron ore production, according to LSEG data. This was well below Nucor Corp's and Steel Dynamics Inc's margins of 30% and 27.5%, respectively — two rivals that run exclusively on electric arc furnaces. It is also below U.S. Steel's 20.6% margin.Goncalves has said profitability will improve as Cliffs gains scale, and projects $500 million in annual synergies from the potential U.S. Steel acquisition.A Cliffs spokesperson said the company is innovating to meet clients' requirements and make U.S. steel competitive.Focus on car makersAbout two-thirds of U.S. steel comes from electric arc furnaces. While Nucor and Steel Dynamics also serve the car sector, they have mostly ceded the market for automotive bodies to Chinese competitors.This has given Cliffs an opening to serve U.S. car makers that find importing overseas steel expensive, especially following tariffs that former President Donald Trump implemented in 2018. While a few carmakers use aluminum for automotive bodies, most prefer high-grade steel from blast furnaces.""Materially switching content isn't something these automakers do lightly. I don't think they're going to move away,"" said KeyBanc equity analyst Phil Gibbs.Cliffs' devotion to blast furnaces, which are unionized unlike some electric arc furnaces, won it the support of United Steelworkers. The union's international president Thomas Conway said it's backing Cliffs' bid for U.S. Steel because of Goncalves' commitment to blast furnaces. He pointed to Cliffs adding 1,700 new jobs following its last two acquisitions.Carbon emissionsGoncalves has said in interviews and earnings calls that criticism of blast furnaces' emissions ignores that electric arc furnaces cannot make the steel many car makers want.""Try to build a car all with steel, flat-rolled steel produced in flat-rolled mini-mills. It doesn't work,"" Goncalves said on Cliffs' latest quarterly earnings call.Nucor's and Steel Dynamics' carbon footprints are more than two-thirds smaller than Cliffs' and U.S. Steel's, their sustainability disclosures show.Cliffs points to having reduced its emissions by 32% since 2017, ahead of a target to achieve this by 2030, primarily by using hot briquetted iron (HBI) in its blast furnaces. HBI is made with natural gas rather than coke from coal, resulting in fewer emissions.Cliffs is also testing the use of hydrogen to reduce emissions, though the technology's commercially viability remains uncertain.Last year, President Joe Biden's administration pointed to Cliffs' direct reduction steel plant in Toledo, Ohio, which cost $1 billion and makes HBI, as an example of ""clean"" U.S. manufacturing.(Reporting by Isla Binnie in New York and Bianca Flowers in Chicago Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Daniel Wallis)]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has lost 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.77 per share, indicating a change of -26.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.76 points to a change of -34.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.13 indicates a change of -35.4% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nucor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.86 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.6%. The $35.04 billion and $32.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.6% and -7.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One method that I will often use is tracking which stocks the big money is buying.As Kiplinger recently pointed out, “billionaires… have larger-than-life reputations when it comes to investing other rich people’s money,” and have “intimate connections to insiders,” along with the funds to facilitate intensive research.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of U.S. Bancorp, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see U.S. Bancorp's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.1% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that U.S. Bancorp insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$113m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - U.S. Bancorp has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

14,6c9829d8-ddfe-358c-916e-3e85e1f68463,MGM,2023-09-05,Here's Why Ralph Lauren (RL) is Rallying Ahead of Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-ralph-lauren-rl-140600814.html,1693836360,STORY,"['RL', 'RCL', 'MGM']","[Ralph Lauren Corp. RL appears commendable on the back of brand strength, solid demand and expansion across all channels. Also, a solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. The company has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.These strengths have aided the first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Notably, RL reported the 12th straight earnings beat and the 10th consecutive revenue surprise in the fiscal first quarter.Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 rose 24.5% year over year from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues grew 0.4% year over year to $1,496.5 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 1% from the prior-year quarter.Average unit retail (AUR) increased in the double-digits in first-quarter fiscal 2024, marking the 25th straight AUR rise, driven by product mix elevation, lower freight and a favorable channel mix. The company’s strategy of product elevation, personalized and targeted promotion, disciplined inventory management and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth.Consequently, management anticipates fiscal 2024 year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits. Also, the gross margin is forecast to expand 100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR, a favorable geographic mix and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation.For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. This includes approximately 100 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. The operating margin is predicted to be 9.5-10% on a reported basis and 9-9.5% in constant currency. The gross margin is expected to expand 40-60 bps, which will more than offset higher operating expenses.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 35.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% growth.Let’s Delve DeeperRalph Lauren is making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment. In the fiscal first quarter, the company’s digital business gained from strength in its international markets, which more than offset weakness in North America. Starting in June, the company witnessed improvements in its North America digital unit.RL reached a milestone of 53.5 million social media followers globally, which reflects a year-over-year high-single-digit increase. This was mainly driven by its popularity in Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. RL has been witnessing online search trends, outpacing its peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories.Region-wise, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It is focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren has been scaling and expanding its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.It is on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. This plan aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.Hurdles on the WayRalph Lauren has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation.  In first-quarter fiscal 2024, adjusted operating expenses inched up 1% from the year-ago period to $830 million, driven by higher compensation, and rent and occupancy costs, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 30 bps to 56%. It expects higher marketing and ecosystem investments for the fiscal second quarter.The company has been witnessing macro inflationary challenges, particularly in North America. This led to a dismal performance in its North America segment in the fiscal first quarter. Higher promotions in the North America market and an unfavorable wholesale timing shift acted as deterrents.The segment’s revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $632 million and lagged our estimate of $635 million.Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel fell 6% year over year, wherein the same for brick-and-mortar stores moved down 8%, while digital commerce decreased 5%. Revenues from the North America wholesale business advanced 16% year over year. For fiscal 2024, management expects a low-single-digit decline in North America.Also, unfavorable currency impacts are concerning.What Else?Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2024 sales and EPS is pegged at $6.6 billion and $9.48 each, suggesting respective growth of 2.5% and 13.7% from the year-ago reported figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPB’s fiscal 2024 earnings for the current financial year has inched up 0.7% in the past 30 days.To wrap up, Ralph Lauren is likely to continue performing well on the back of such sturdy endeavors. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4% speak volumes.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 81%, on average.

Specifically, Powell said, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”  Since everyone, including the Chairman, believes that the Fed’s current interest rate is “restrictive,” the words “toward our objective” in that sentence apparently mean that the central bank is willing to consider cutting rates if inflation is falling, but is above its 2% nominal target. Moreover, the fact that Powell is willing to consider cutting relatively soon likely means that — absent a major increase in inflation — the Fed is done raising rates. As the market wakes up to that, I expect growth stocks to buy to climb much further.Growth Stocks to Buy: Quanta Services (PWR)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocks. Sleeper Growth StocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockQuanta (NYSE:PWR) builds electrical power stations, infrastructure, and facilities for renewable energy and the transmission of natural gas. With that, Quanta is well-positioned to benefit from the renewable-energy revolution, and the electrification of transportation.Helping, Quanta just delivered “beat-and-raise” fiscal first quarter results. Revenues jumped 20% year over year, as its net income jumped to $1.12, one-cent above the mean estimate. With guidance, Quanta increased its sales outlook to $19.6 billion to $20 billion from its previous guidance of $18.40 billion to $18.9 billion. It also hiked its net income guidance to $705 million to $765 million from $692 million to $766 million. In addition, the company has a record backlog of $27.2 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso, as noted by Quanta CEO Duke Austin, the firm’s strong results were driven by powerful demand from electric utilities, renewable energy generators and “the move towards a reduced-carbon economy.”Story continuesXpeng (XPEV)Xpeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry ExhibitionSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.comChinese electric-vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) announced that it formed a new alliance with Chinese ride-sharing giant DiDi Global (OTCMKTS:DIDIY). The two will create affordable electric vehicles. Moreover, Xpeng stated that “it would explore collaborations with Didi on fleet management, marketing, insurance, charging facilities, robotaxis and international markets.”Such a joint venture, I believe, would be very profitable and would meaningfully boost Xpeng’s financial results, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. Bank of America believes that the deal will boost Xpeng’s brand, and the bank kept a $22 price target and a “buy” rating on the shares.Growth Stocks to Buy: MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) is benefiting from multiple, strong, positive catalysts, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. Two of the most  catalysts are the expansion of BetMGM, its online sports-betting venture, and the continued revival of Macau, China’s gambling hub.On Aug. 17, MGM disclosed that BetMGM was expanding to the UK. The news shows that, in addition to entering new U.S. states that legalize online betting, it will also penetrate significant overseas markets, which could be a sizable catalyst to its bottom line. Helping, analysts at Jefferies reported that traffic in the Chinese region had reached its highest level in 2023. Further, last month MGM announced a partnership with hotel chain Marriott (NYSE:MAR), which could allow MGM to obtain a significant number of new customers.Workday (WDAY)Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn a previous article, I reported that “Workday’s (NASDAQ:WDAY) cloud applications enable companies to easily manage their finances and human resources functions. It also has apps that allow companies to efficiently analyze their operations and plan initiatives using AI.”On Aug.. 24, Workday reported very strong second-quarter results as its revenue climbed 16% versus the same period a year earlier and its “24-month subscription revenue backlog” soared 23% year-over-year to a very impressive $10.27 billion.” Also noteworthy was that its earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $1.45, 17 cents above analysts’ average estimate and much higher than the 83 cents that it reported in Q2 of 2022.Morgan Stanley was upbeat on WDAY stock in the wake of the results, contending that the company is benefiting from its new products and looks poised to increase its free cash flow at a compound annual growth rate of “25%+ over the next three years.” The bank kept an “overweight” rating on the shares.Growth Stocks to Buy: EVgo (EVGO)EVgo fast charging stationSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comEVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), one of America’s leading providers of EV chargers, continues to grow. It also continues to make multiple new deals that should enable further growth. Last quarter, the company’s top line soared an incredible 456% versus Q2 of 2022, coming in at $50.6 million, $21 million above analysts’ average estimate. And it reported a loss per share of 8 cents, ten cents above the mean estimate.Also importantly, its customers utilized a record 24.9 gigawatt-hours of electricity, representing a 147% jump versus the same period a year earlier.As far as deals are concerned, EVgo, along with a number of its partners, was selected by Ohio earlier this month to receive $13.8 million. The funds will enable the company to introduce 20 new fast-charging stations in the state.Additionally, the company recently announced that two popular EVs made by Rivian, the rapidly growing electric SUV and truck maker, would be able to start using EVgo’s  Autocharge+,service. The latter service “allows EV drivers to seamlessly initiate a charging session by simply plugging in their vehicle to an EVgo fast charger,” EVgo explained.Powell Industries (POWL)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockPowell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) sells equipment used by electricity generators. Like Quanta, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the electrification of transportation and Washington’s spending on infrastructure improvements. Additionally, three of the company’s other major end markets –liquid natural gas producers, miners, and datacenters — also have strong, positive catalysts going forward.Last quarter, the company’s revenue soared 42% versus the same period a year earlier to $192 million, while its backlog “nearly tripled to a record $1.3 billion” and its new orders soared $303 million year-over-year to $505 million. “Looking forward, we anticipate continued strength across most of our core end markets into fiscal 2024,” said CFO Michael Metcalf in a statement.Vertiv Holdings (VRT)Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) appears to be benefiting from the rapid expansion of data centers as the amount of data used in our society rapidly expands. This trend should accelerate further as artificial intelligence proliferates. Last quarter, the company’s top line climbed 23.6% versus the same period a year earlier and its operating profit, excluding certain items, jumped $169 million year-over-year to $251 million.The midpoint of the company’s 2023 sales guidance range is  now $6.8 billion, $285 million above its previous outlook. “I am…encouraged by the (company’s) growth acceleration potential, which has just begun in our industry, represented by data center infrastructure necessary to meet the rapidly growing demand for compute capacity driven by AI,” Vertiv CEO Giordano Albertazzi said in a recent press release.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long XPEV, MGM, EVGO, and RIVN. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 1.03%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 5.74%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHIs Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 2/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 2/105. Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd the GF Score of 58 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Company Snapshot: Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings LtdNorwegian Cruise Line is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths (at more than 60,000), operating 30 ships across three brands (Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas), offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. The company had redeployed its entire fleet as of May 2022. With seven passenger vessels on order among its brands through 2028 (representing 19,000 incremental berths), Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Norwegian sails to around 700 global destinations.Story continuesIs Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0, positions it worse than 0% of 554 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just -0.22, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.07 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 903.85, which is worse than 100% of 669 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 21.12, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.24% of 580 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -27.2 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 85.88% of 765 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Is Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd has a rich history and a strong brand presence, its current financial health and growth prospects paint a less than rosy picture. Investors should tread carefully and consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making.Still, earnings acceleration works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t yet caught the attention of investors and, once secured, will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.Screening ParametersLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the previous periods' growth rates. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).Story continuesEPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only three.

The price elasticity has changed. It is volatile, and the situation is potentially fragile,"" he said.""Temperature is the key factor that will cause probably a very significant price swing, but I think we will be able to cope with it,"" Lewis said.Meanwhile, a senior executive at Chevron said on Tuesday that the global LNG spot market is expected to stay volatile until 2025, and even a normal winter in Europe could be difficult as far as gas supplies are concerned.""As we go into this winter, if it's a normal winter, it could be a very difficult time for some of the Europeans like Germany and other countries,"" said Freeman Shaheen, Chevron's head of global gas business.Story continuesWinter LNG prices that are expensive relative to coal could deter some buyers in Asia, said Russell Hardy, chief executive of Vitol, the world's largest independent oil trader.""You're going to continue to see in Pakistan, to some extent India, some extent China... they'll make choices not to take in LNG at these prices, and they'll use other fuels,"" he said.""There isn't quite enough LNG to go around still, and if any of the possible negative side events of weather or supply disruptions do occur this winter, the volatility will return.""M.L. Peekthong Thongyai, senior vice president for the gas business unit at Thailand's PTT, expects LNG prices to edge up this winter but added that ""the slowdown in China this year has kind of kept prices from going berserk"".""It should be okay this year,"" he said.RISING DEMANDOver the longer term, Uniper's Lewis said the next two to three years would be challenging as European demand begins to rise, fuelled by more gas-fired power generation coming online, although ramped up LNG capacity expected from the United States and Qatar between 2026 and 2028 should boost supply by about 20%.Germany needs ""probably"" 25-30 gigawatts of new gas-fired power capacity over the next seven to eight years, he said.""If you look at the long, long term, we do see European LNG demand peaking in the mid-2030s and then it should start to decline in line with overall decarbonisation targets of Europe,"" he said.""But there is very much an uncertainty in how quickly that will happen,"" he said.Chevron's Shaheen also said that Europe will continue to need gas to manage the intermittency of renewable energy, and that Chevron still believes in a recovery in Chinese demand.""I think we're all expecting them to wake up, and when they wake up, it will be quite rapid. It just hasn't happened at that scale. China and their growth typically will attract all commodities ... I still believe in the long term prospects.""China was the world's top LNG importer in 2021, shipping in nearly 79 million metric tons of the fuel.

Participation would be voluntary, but if the EU faced a fuel supply crisis, joint buying would become mandatory to avoid EU countries competing for the same scarce volumes.""It's established, it's working, the number of companies is increasing,"" one senior EU official said, of joint gas buying.Despite initial scepticism from industry sources over whether companies would use the scheme, the EU has so far gathered demand for more than 27 billion cubic metres of gas - double the 13.5 bcm Brussels had aimed to purchase jointly.However, it is not clear how much of that demand has been translated into firm contracts. The EU matches gas buyers and sellers, but is not involved in the commercial negotiations that follow - and companies are not obliged to disclose when they sign deals. The new EU proposal would require companies to report when they sign contacts through the scheme.Negotiators from EU member states and the European Parliament - which must both approve new EU laws - will discuss the proposal later this month. They aim to finish the law by the end of the year.Story continuesCountries are still negotiating how to define a ""supply crisis"" that would trigger mandatory joint buying, and whether to extend joint buying to other energy commodities such as hydrogen, the senior EU official said.The proposal suggests expanding the scheme to assist the planned European Hydrogen Bank that will be launched in November.The joint purchases make up only a sliver of the EU's total gas demand of around 360 bcm, but aim to help countries prepare for winter when Europe's gas demand for heating peaks. The EU heads towards this winter with its gas storage caverns unusually full - at 93% of capacity, Gas Infrastructure Europe data show.The EU has vowed to quit Russian fossil fuels by 2027. European imports of Russian pipeline gas - the main way Moscow previously sent gas to Europe - have plunged since Russia invaded Ukraine, but EU countries have struggled to quit Russian liquefied natural gas. The joint buying scheme cannot purchase Russian gas. (Reporting by Kate Abnett and Julia Payne; editing by David Evans)]"
23,c8c3669e-747c-3675-b6a7-895e54a29b24,O,2023-09-05,Cleveland-Cliffs' bid to keep US blast furnaces smelting,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-inside-cleveland-cliffs-bid-100000026.html,1693908000,STORY,"['X', 'STLD', 'NG=F', 'CLF', 'NUE']","[High costs and environmental opposition have prevented the construction of blast furnaces at steel mills in the United States since 1980. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc CEO Lourenco Goncalves is on a mission to snap up all that are left.Since joining the U.S. steelmaker in 2014 as part of an activist hedge fund's board takeover, Goncalves has made blast furnaces a hallmark of his strategy, positioning Cliffs as an outlier in an industry shifting towards cheaper and more environmentally friendly electric arc furnaces.A 65-year-old Brazilian metallurgical engineer, Goncalves transformed Cliffs from an iron ore and coal miner into the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America by acquiring companies that own blast furnaces to smelt the pig iron it produces.Now, he has his sights on acquiring U.S. Steel Corp, the other remaining U.S. blast furnace operator, which has been gradually moving into electric arc furnaces, known as mini-mills. Should his $7.3 billion cash-and-stock bid prevail, Cliffs would break into the world's top 10 steel producers, which are mostly from Asia.Interviews with six people close to the companies and industry insiders, as well a review of regulatory filings, show Goncalves' bet on blast furnaces has yet to pay off, and its success hinges on pulling off the deal with U.S. Steel.This is because blast furnaces operate around the clock and need more workers. They are more expensive to run when they have to be stopped and restarted to account for changes in demand, as often happens with the automotive sector.To compensate for that cost, they need a dominant market share so they can charge more for their steel. To build a market position, Cliffs acquired AK Steel for $3 billion and ArcelorMittal's U.S. operations for $3.3 billion in 2020. Cliffs focused on dominating production of U.S.-made steel used in the external panels of cars, which require quality that electric arc furnaces currently cannot achieve.Story continues""By increasing market share, Goncalves has a much more commanding position where he can charge more,"" said Josh Spoores, principal analyst at CRU Group, a business intelligence firm that provides analysis on global metals and mining.Goncalves is also betting that producing iron ore in-house for blast furnaces, rather than sourcing scrap steel for electric arc furnaces, will give Cliffs a competitive edge. So far, the nimbler electric arc furnaces have remained cheaper to run, amid fluctuations in demand for steel.Cliffs' gross margin was 11% last year, down from 35% in 2018, when it focused on iron ore production, according to LSEG data. This was well below Nucor Corp's and Steel Dynamics Inc's margins of 30% and 27.5%, respectively — two rivals that run exclusively on electric arc furnaces. It is also below U.S. Steel's 20.6% margin.Goncalves has said profitability will improve as Cliffs gains scale, and projects $500 million in annual synergies from the potential U.S. Steel acquisition.A Cliffs spokesperson said the company is innovating to meet clients' requirements and make U.S. steel competitive.Focus on car makersAbout two-thirds of U.S. steel comes from electric arc furnaces. While Nucor and Steel Dynamics also serve the car sector, they have mostly ceded the market for automotive bodies to Chinese competitors.This has given Cliffs an opening to serve U.S. car makers that find importing overseas steel expensive, especially following tariffs that former President Donald Trump implemented in 2018. While a few carmakers use aluminum for automotive bodies, most prefer high-grade steel from blast furnaces.""Materially switching content isn't something these automakers do lightly. I don't think they're going to move away,"" said KeyBanc equity analyst Phil Gibbs.Cliffs' devotion to blast furnaces, which are unionized unlike some electric arc furnaces, won it the support of United Steelworkers. The union's international president Thomas Conway said it's backing Cliffs' bid for U.S. Steel because of Goncalves' commitment to blast furnaces. He pointed to Cliffs adding 1,700 new jobs following its last two acquisitions.Carbon emissionsGoncalves has said in interviews and earnings calls that criticism of blast furnaces' emissions ignores that electric arc furnaces cannot make the steel many car makers want.""Try to build a car all with steel, flat-rolled steel produced in flat-rolled mini-mills. It doesn't work,"" Goncalves said on Cliffs' latest quarterly earnings call.Nucor's and Steel Dynamics' carbon footprints are more than two-thirds smaller than Cliffs' and U.S. Steel's, their sustainability disclosures show.Cliffs points to having reduced its emissions by 32% since 2017, ahead of a target to achieve this by 2030, primarily by using hot briquetted iron (HBI) in its blast furnaces. HBI is made with natural gas rather than coke from coal, resulting in fewer emissions.Cliffs is also testing the use of hydrogen to reduce emissions, though the technology's commercially viability remains uncertain.Last year, President Joe Biden's administration pointed to Cliffs' direct reduction steel plant in Toledo, Ohio, which cost $1 billion and makes HBI, as an example of ""clean"" U.S. manufacturing.(Reporting by Isla Binnie in New York and Bianca Flowers in Chicago Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Daniel Wallis)]"

It is currently focused on upgrading its electric distribution and transmission infrastructure. The company forecasts a capital investment of $21.5 billion during 2023-2027 period, out of which it plans to invest $14.2 billion in electric and natural distribution networks and $5.3 billion in its electric transmission segment. It has planned to make clean energy investments of $2 billion during 2023-2027 period to strengthen its renewable portfolio.The company diversified operations and forayed into the water business through the acquisition of Aquarion Water Company in December 2017.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Salesforce.com (CRM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this customer-management software developer a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 24.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 43.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.9%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Salesforce.com (CRM) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Salesforce.com is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRM's full-year earnings has moved 0.8% higher.

Meanwhile, stocks in the Computer and Technology group have gained about 41.6% on average. This means that Salesforce.com is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.Another Computer and Technology stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Extreme Networks (EXTR).

34,f6ec030e-fd0e-3b63-8ccc-26f28680e2b0,CRM,2023-09-05,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-130011504.html,1693832411,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +3.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +33.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.51 points to a change of +43.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.09 indicates a change of +21.1% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11%. The $34.72 billion and $38.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.8% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.93%. The EPS surprise was +11.58%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

35,559ba1ea-307e-34bc-bd7a-1a18a57de332,FLS,2023-09-05,Here's What To Make Of Flowserve's (NYSE:FLS) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-flowserves-nyse-fls-decelerating-132853840.html,1693834133,STORY,['FLS'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Flowserve (NYSE:FLS), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Flowserve:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.088 = US$321m ÷ (US$4.9b - US$1.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Flowserve has an ROCE of 8.8%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Machinery industry average of 12%. See our latest analysis for Flowserve roceIn the above chart we have measured Flowserve's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Flowserve.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Flowserve's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Flowserve to be a multi-bagger going forward.The Bottom LineIn a nutshell, Flowserve has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has declined 15% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Flowserve (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .While Flowserve isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

RL appears commendable on the back of brand strength, solid demand and expansion across all channels. Also, a solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. The company has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.These strengths have aided the first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Notably, RL reported the 12th straight earnings beat and the 10th consecutive revenue surprise in the fiscal first quarter.Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 rose 24.5% year over year from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues grew 0.4% year over year to $1,496.5 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 1% from the prior-year quarter.Average unit retail (AUR) increased in the double-digits in first-quarter fiscal 2024, marking the 25th straight AUR rise, driven by product mix elevation, lower freight and a favorable channel mix. The company’s strategy of product elevation, personalized and targeted promotion, disciplined inventory management and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth.Consequently, management anticipates fiscal 2024 year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits. Also, the gross margin is forecast to expand 100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR, a favorable geographic mix and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation.For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. This includes approximately 100 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. The operating margin is predicted to be 9.5-10% on a reported basis and 9-9.5% in constant currency. The gross margin is expected to expand 40-60 bps, which will more than offset higher operating expenses.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 35.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% growth.Let’s Delve DeeperRalph Lauren is making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment. In the fiscal first quarter, the company’s digital business gained from strength in its international markets, which more than offset weakness in North America. Starting in June, the company witnessed improvements in its North America digital unit.RL reached a milestone of 53.5 million social media followers globally, which reflects a year-over-year high-single-digit increase. This was mainly driven by its popularity in Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. RL has been witnessing online search trends, outpacing its peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories.Region-wise, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It is focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren has been scaling and expanding its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.It is on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. This plan aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.Hurdles on the WayRalph Lauren has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation.  In first-quarter fiscal 2024, adjusted operating expenses inched up 1% from the year-ago period to $830 million, driven by higher compensation, and rent and occupancy costs, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 30 bps to 56%. It expects higher marketing and ecosystem investments for the fiscal second quarter.The company has been witnessing macro inflationary challenges, particularly in North America. This led to a dismal performance in its North America segment in the fiscal first quarter. Higher promotions in the North America market and an unfavorable wholesale timing shift acted as deterrents.The segment’s revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $632 million and lagged our estimate of $635 million.Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel fell 6% year over year, wherein the same for brick-and-mortar stores moved down 8%, while digital commerce decreased 5%. Revenues from the North America wholesale business advanced 16% year over year. For fiscal 2024, management expects a low-single-digit decline in North America.Also, unfavorable currency impacts are concerning.What Else?Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2024 sales and EPS is pegged at $6.6 billion and $9.48 each, suggesting respective growth of 2.5% and 13.7% from the year-ago reported figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPB’s fiscal 2024 earnings for the current financial year has inched up 0.7% in the past 30 days.To wrap up, Ralph Lauren is likely to continue performing well on the back of such sturdy endeavors. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4% speak volumes.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 81%, on average.

37,6cda1d28-586b-3f5b-ad2d-d7f86bac9f11,RL,2023-09-05,3 Consumer Goods Stocks Due for a Massive Short Squeeze,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-consumer-goods-stocks-due-140759571.html,1693318079,STORY,"['RL', 'CVNA', 'FSR']","[The stock market has primarily been on a tear this year. Year-to-date, the S&amp;P500 and the Nasdaq indices have risen 14.75% and 35.44%, respectively. This expectation-defying capital appreciation was not without its moments of volatility, and, of course, not every sector in the equities market is performing up to par. Some consumer discretionary stocks have been under pressure from rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition. This article will look at three consumer stocks that could rally in the near term and trigger a massive short squeeze. These companies generally have high short interests, which means many investors are betting against these shares relative to the total outstanding shares in the market. Instead of hoping for a miracle, equity investors are betting off selling and moving on.Ralph Lauren (RL)A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.Source: Martin Good / Shutterstock.comThis world-renowned brand requires little introduction. A global leader in apparel, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) designs, markets, and distributes premium lifestyle clothing and accessory products. The famed apparel company operates in three geographic segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. Unfortunately, despite having garnered much brand awareness and a sizable customer following, the company has struggled to meaningfully grow revenue and earnings for many years.If an investor were to look at a decade’s worth of Ralph Lauren’s income statements, they would notice the company has, at times, endured periods of two or three years of consecutive revenue contraction. A global pandemic in 2020 did not help. About 12 months after the pandemic had begun, Ralph Lauren posted a 29% year-over-year decline in revenue and a 68% decline in net income. Once pandemic-era restrictions were lifted, the apparel company benefitted from both broad, pent-up consumer demand. Still, even this was short-lived, as the fiscal year 2023 revenue growth, which covers growth from March 2022 to March 2023, was sluggish and came in at just under 4%.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRalph Lauren has a relatively high short interest of 8.59%. This indicates that many investors are bearish on the stock and expect it to fall further in the near term. The past quarterly results have not breathed any new life into the company’s shares either. Revenue growth from Ralph Lauren’s North American and European reporting segments sharply declined year-over-year. Overall growth has been spurred by higher demand in Asia. Growth numbers could pick up overwhelmingly as China’s economy continues to recover. If this occurs, Ralph Lauren could surpass the expectations, triggering a short squeeze. That makes it one of the best consumer stocks right now, in my opinion.Carvana (CVNA)Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine. Carvana is an online-only used car dealer.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comConsumer goods, of course, are not only about apparel and related accessories. Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) is an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars in the United States. The platform grew rapidly in the past decade, mainly benefitting from the secular shift to online car buying. Similarly, post-pandemic demand for used cars amid the semiconductor shortage affected new car production. As a result, Carvana’s revenue increased by 129% year-over-year to $12.8 billion, while its net loss narrowed by 21% to $135 million.However, that spectacular era of growth seems to have been short-lived. The e-commerce platform already operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market, where traditional dealerships, online platforms, and peer-to-peer marketplaces compete. Moreover, Carvana relies on third-party sources for its inventory and financing, exposing it to supply chain disruptions and certain credit risks. In particular, the company’s debt burden remains significant at above $7.6 billion as of June 30. Last year, as interest rates increased, Carvana’s stock price tanked as investors doubted its ability to bear higher rates.Carvana still has a very high short interest of 32.6%, which suggests many investors remain skeptical about its ability to sustain its growth rate and profitability. However, the company has been able to beat profitability expectations in recent quarterly results, already pushing several short sellers into a squeeze. If Carvana continues to optimize its operations and beats profitability estimates, short sellers could find themselves again in a doomsday scenario.Fisker (FSR)Fisker's (FSR) new Ocean electric vehicle is displayed at the 2021 LA Auto Show.Source: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock.comFisker (NYSE:FSR) is an electric vehicle (EV) startup that delivered its first model, the Fisker Ocean SUV, to the United States in June. The company has partnered with Magna International (NYSE:MGA), a leading automotive supplier, to manufacture the Ocean at Magna’s plant in Europe. Fisker also announced in 2021 that Foxconn would help it manufacture crossover vehicles.Fisker has generated a lot of hype among investors as it aims to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other established automakers in the fast-growing EV market. The company claims that the Ocean will be the world’s most sustainable vehicle, with features such as a solar roof, recycled materials, and vegan leather. The company also boasts a low-cost and asset-light business model, as it leverages its partners’ expertise and capacity to produce its vehicles.Unfortunately, the company has no revenue or earnings to date and expects to incur significant losses shortly. Much of the stock’s success will hinge on Fisker’s ability to successfully manufacture and sell its first vehicle. That manufacturing deal Fisker announced with Foxconn a couple of years ago still appears to be in negotiations. Still, if the deal is finalized and approved, short sellers could be pushed into a short-squeeze scenario. Thus, this is among the top consumer stocks to buy before a short squeeze.On the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One such stock that warrants scrutiny is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Despite its current price of $23.43, having experienced a daily loss of 7.43% and a 3-month decrease of 21.33%, its fair valuation according to its GF Value is $45.81.Understanding GF ValueWarning!

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDecoding the Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the specifics, it's important to understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Closer LookWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., with over 8,500 locations. Nearly three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens location. Roughly two thirds of revenue is generated from prescription drug sales; Walgreens makes up 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Walgreens also generates sales from retail products (general wellness consumables and its own branded merchandise), European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients and positions itself as a one-stop healthcare provider.Story continuesIs Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDissecting Walgreens Boots Alliance's Low Altman Z-ScoreDespite its apparent undervaluation, Walgreens Boots Alliance might be a potential value trap due to its low Altman Z-score of 1.74. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Walgreens Boots Alliance's historical data, we observe a declining trend in this ratio, which indicates Walgreens Boots Alliance's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, negatively impacting its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness. An analysis of Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data indicates a descending trend, suggesting that Walgreens Boots Alliance might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Walgreens Boots Alliance is its asset turnover. The data from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Walgreens Boots Alliance's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapWhile Walgreens Boots Alliance may seem like an attractive investment opportunity due to its undervaluation, the company's low Altman Z-Score and declining financial health indicators suggest that it might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the rising popularity of craft beer, the domestic production of Sapporo beers, and the entrance of a beverage giant in craft, and go directly to 5 Best Craft Breweries in America. While the U.S. toiled in beer production purgatory following the repeal of Prohibition, all of that began to change when President Jimmy Carter signed a small but groundbreaking bill, making homebrewing legal. It took a little bit of time, but that eventually led to several new craft breweries popping up in the 1980s. Many of the brewing ventures that started in this time period were done so not by professionals, but individuals ready to take their home brewing to the next level. The trend slowly grew, and by the 2000s, microbreweries had expanded throughout much of the United States.The Rising Popularity of Craft Beer: The United States is the country that produces the most craft beer in the world. As we mentioned in our article – 20 States with the Most Craft Breweries – there were 9,552 craft breweries, brewpubs, and taprooms in the U.S. in 2022, up almost 99% from 2015. Meanwhile, retail dollar sales of craft increased 5%, to $28.4 billion, and now account for 24.6% of the $115 billion overall U.S. beer market. The principle strength of craft brewing lies in its vast array of beer innovations to reflect the shift of today’s consumers, as it offers its customers ‘something different’ from what they’re normally used to. Craft lovers are willing to pay a little more for beer that holds more taste, flavor, variety, and alcohol. The quality ingredients and delicious tastes that craft beers offer are not usually found in their mass-produced counterparts. Moreover, drinking craft is also a way to support your local businesses. The Domestic Production of Sapporo Beers: On June 23rd, Stone Brewing shocked the craft beer biz by announcing that it was being acquired by the Japanese brewing giant Sapporo, and the $165 million deal closed quickly in August.Story continuesFounded by Greg Koch and Steve Wagner in 1996, Stone Brewing was one of the largest craft breweries in the United States at the time, but given that it is now owned by an international beer behemoth, it is no longer considered a true ‘craft brewery’ using the Brewers Association's definition of craft beer. With this transition, Stone's well-known founders Greg Koch and Steve Wagner are no longer in the picture. Under Sapporo’s management, Stone continues to operate breweries in Escondido, CA, and Richmond, VA, along with seven taproom and bistro locations. The Japanese company’s goal is to not only manage Stone’s growth in the United States, but also to harness the brewery’s considerable production resources to produce more Sapporo beers in America, where it is currently the #1 selling Asian beer brand. The Richmond Stone brewery will make about 40% of the company’s total domestic output, with the remaining 60% being made out of Stone’s California operations.  The move by the company to make Sapporo beer at the Stone breweries is ironic given that Stone’s previous co-founder and co-owner, Greg Koch, famously mocked mass-produced lagers by global brewers as ‘fizzy yellow beer’. It is worth mentioning that Sapporo also acquired San Francisco-based Anchor Brewing in 2017 for $85 million, with plans of brewing its Asian offerings at Anchor’s production facility. However, the marriage didn’t exactly go to plan and America’s oldest craft brewery ended up permanently ceasing its operations in July. The Entrance of a Beverage Giant: It was announced last year that the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) had acquired the Canarchy Craft Brewery Collective, in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) the ownership of Canarchy’s craft breweries including Cigar City, Oskar Blues, Deep Ellum, Perrin Brewing, Squatters, and Wasatch. The deal provided the beverage giant with a ready-made platform to join the alcohol industry, including infrastructure, people, distribution and licenses, alcoholic beverage development experience, and manufacturing capabilities. Canarchy is an interesting move for the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) because it entered alcohol through craft beer and hard seltzer, a pair of maturing yet popular categories where consumers have countless options to choose from. The company spent the early weeks of 2023 rolling out a line of alcoholic beverages. Called The Beast Unleashed, the drinks are made with malt alcohol and contain 6% alcohol by volume, though no caffeine or energy-inducing ingredients. The Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) announced in its Q2 Earnings Call Transcript: “In the first half of 2023, we launched The Beast Unleashed which is now available in 28 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution, with the goal of being national by the end of the year. According to Nielsen scan data, The Beast Unleashed is currently one of the top new brands in the beer category in 2023. We plan to launch a hot iced tea extension of The Beast Unleashed named Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea later this year or early next year, with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024. The brand will have full flavors Original, Half &amp; Half, Razzleberry and Green. Nasty Beast Hardcore Tea will be available in 24 oz. single-serve cans as well as in a variety 12-pack in 12 ounce sleek cans.”With that said, here are the Top Craft Breweries in America in 2023. 20 Best Craft Breweries in AmericaValentyn Volkov/Shutterstock.comMethodology:To collect data for this article, we referred to a number of sources, such as Tasting Table, VinePair, 24/7 Wall St., Reddit etc., looking for the Best Craft Breweries in the U.S. We picked breweries that appeared at least thrice in these sources, assigned them a score based on their number of appearances, and ranked them accordingly.

Deschutes BreweryInsider Monkey Score: 3Deschutes Brewery has always been family owned and operated.

By 2019, Mahou had increased its stake to 90%. 16. Bierstadt LagerhausInsider Monkey Score: 4Bierstadt Lagerhaus has been named the ‘Best Colorado Brewery’ and ‘Best Lager Brewery In The Country’ in recent years. In the American craft beer scene, the technique of slow pouring a beer can be attributed to Ashleigh Carter and Bill Eye, owners of Bierstadt Lagerhaus in Denver. Both subsequently created the Slow Pour Pils, which ranks among the 20 Highest Rated Pilsner Beers in 2023. 15. New Belgium Brewing Co.Insider Monkey Score: 5New Belgium was the top-selling craft beer brand in the U.S multi-outlets in 2022, with dollar sales of $429.3 million, a 14.5% increase from the previous year. In 2019, New Belgium was acquired by the Japanese beverage group Kirin Holdings Company, in a deal estimated to be around $352.8 million. New Belgium ranks among the Top 15 Craft Breweries in the U.S.14. Boulevard Brewing Co. Insider Monkey Score: 5When John McDonald tried out some Belgian beers on his trip to Europe in 1984, he became absolutely captivated with them. So much so that one day he decided to sell his house and invest in a craft brewery that eventually became the largest specialty brewer in the Midwest. Boulevard Brewing Company was acquired by the Duvel Moortgat Brewery in 2013, in a deal worth an estimated $100 million. 13. Bell’s Brewing Co. Insider Monkey Score: 5The Michigan-based Bell’s Brewery was acquired by Kirin-owned Lion World Beverages for an undisclosed amount in 2021. The deal brought Bell's into the same portfolio of fellow craft beer pioneer New Belgium Brewing Co. 12. The AlchemistInsider Monkey Score: 5The Alchemist is a Vermont-based family-run brewery specializing in fresh, unfiltered IPAs. Today, The Alchemist operates two breweries in Waterbury and Stowe and distributes Heady Topper and Focal Banger throughout the state, with the occasional out-of-state shipment.Heady Topper is an American Double IPA that ranks among the 60 Highest Rated Beers in America. 11. Lagunitas Brewing Co. Insider Monkey Score: 6The Chicago-based Lagunitas boasted $162.1 million in dollar sales in 2022, a 10.9% decrease from 2021. Lagunitas Brewing Co. and Alvarado Street Bakery, both from Petaluma, have recently joined for a neighborly collaboration to prevent waste and produce a beer made from leftover bread. The results are on tap as a limited-edition lager – The Toast of Petaluma.Lagunitas was acquired by Heineken N.V. in 2017. 10. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery Insider Monkey Score: 6Dogfish Head Craft Brewery was acquired by The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) in 2019, in a deal that paid the founder Sam Calagione and his family $127.7 million in shares of the Samuel Adams maker, and $173 million in cash to its shareholders. Both, The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) and Dogfish Head have each maintained their status as independent craft breweries.At the end of Q2, The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) was held by 30 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database, with Southeastern Asset Management boasting the largest stake of 127,274 shares, valued at around $39.25 million. 9. Stone BrewingInsider Monkey Score: 6Stone Brewing was founded by Greg Koch and Steve Wagner in 1996 in San Marcos, California. Their mission was to create flavorful, amazing beers and provide an alternative choice for those who were unsatisfied with the industrialized beers dominating the market at the time. Stone Brewing counts among the Top 10 Craft Breweries in America. 8. Firestone Walker Brewing Co.Insider Monkey Score: 6Known for its best-selling beers like 805 and Mind Haze, this California-based brewery was named the World Beer Cup Champion Brewery in 2004, 2006, 2010, and 2012. Firestone Walker merged with Duvel Moortgat USA in 2015, in a deal worth an estimated $250 million.7. 3 Floyds Brewing Insider Monkey Score: 6The 3 Floyds brewery is known for making some of the best craft beers in the U.S. and for commissioning artists to design bizarre labels for their beers. The Zombie Dust ‘Undead Pale Ale’ is a medium-bodied single hop beer that ranks among the Best Craft Beer Brands in the U.S. 3 Floyds ranks 7th in our List of the Best Craft Breweries. 6. Tree House Brewing Co.Insider Monkey Score: 6Tree House has eight of the 30 highest rated beers in the world on Beer Advocate and eight of the 40 highest rated beers on Untappd. Considering the sheer number of breweries in the world it is crazy to believe that so many of the top-rated beers could be made by a single establishment. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Charlton-based beer maker is among the top breweries in the world. Tree House produced 48,400 BBLs of beer in 2018 and had an estimated revenue of $48 million.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Craft Breweries in America. Suggested Articles:20 States that Produce the Most Craft BeerTop 25 Beer Producing Countries in the World20 Countries that Drink the Most Beer per CapitaDisclosure: None. 20 Best Craft Breweries in America is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

GOOG stock and Google layoffsSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.comShares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG / NASDAQ:GOOGL) have had a good run this year. Shares have grown nearly 50% since January. The strong performance has been driven by the company’s leadership position in artificial intelligence (AI) and a rebound in advertising spending at its core online search business. Expectations are high for continued growth in AI with the integration of the Bard chatbot into Alphabet’s Google search engine. This is meant to rival Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing search engine that now incorporates ChatGPT.At the same time, Alphabet is starting to see a rebound in its online advertising revenue, with analysts forecasting an acceleration to double digit growth in this year’s second half. The company also continues to see big growth in its cloud computing unit, which has grown leaps and bounds in recent years. Add in Pixel smartphones, self-driving cars and digital assistants and there are lots of reasons to remain bullish on GOOGL stock.

This year, the share price is up 14%, matching the performance of the broader market. However, it likely won’t be long before MNST stock is again outperforming and in aggressive growth mode. Following a few disappointing earnings prints, Monster has announced plans to launch alcoholic beverages and energy drinks targeted at women to help boost growth.Energy drinks remain the fastest growing segment of the beverage market. Grand View Research forecasts that energy drinks will grow at an annualized 8.3% rate and reach worldwide sales of $177 billion by 2030. That compares with annual sales growth of 4.7% among soft drink companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Monster projects sales growth of 14% this year and 12% in 2024, as it expands into new categories that include zero-sugar products.

At first glance, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently clarified that while inflation is finally moving in the right direction, policymakers still have much work to do. Further, relief in rising borrowing costs in the form of rate cuts probably won’t happen anytime soon.On the other hand, following Powell’s comments last week, the market responded positively. Per CNBC, investors focused on the Fed Chair’s optimistic remarks, such as the “especially robust” consumer spending, along with early signs of a housing market recovery. Still, with the major indices printing soft performances in the trailing month, it may be time to consider steady stocks.To be sure, there will be a cycle when it’s appropriate to swing for the fences. For now, the below all-weather stocks may be a smarter approach.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSafe Stocks: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the easiest names to identify as one of the safe stocks to buy, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a household goods giant. What I like here is that it’s about as inoffensive as a company as you can get (aside from whatever political stances it may have). Basically, no matter what happens in the wider economy, you’re going to need common goods like shampoo or toilet paper.To be fair, P&amp;G suffers some vulnerability from the trade-down effect. In other words, consumers can elect store-brand products as opposed to P&amp;G brands. But without getting too graphic, there’s a noticeable difference in quality between cheapo generic stuff and the branded equivalent. Therefore, I still like PG as one of the steady stocks to add to your portfolio.As for passive income, P&amp;G isn’t overly generous. Still, it provides a forward yield of 2.45%, better than the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Most importantly, the company commands 68 years of consecutive dividend increases. That makes PG a dividend king.Story continuesMerck (MRK)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to safe stocks, you probably can’t go wrong with healthcare giant Merck (NYSE:MRK). Carrying a market capitalization of around $280 billion, Merck basically benefits from permanent relevance. When health circumstances go awry for individuals, they’re likely going to do what they need to stay alive. And Merck facilitates said opportunity with various powerful and relevant therapeutics.Now, I acknowledge that shares really haven’t gone anywhere since the beginning of this year. Nevertheless, its underperformance could be a chance to pick up all-weather stocks at a relative discount. For example, the company prints strong operational stats, specifically a three-year revenue and EBITDA growth rate (per-share basis) of 15.4% and 23.9%, respectively. These stats are both well above average for the underlying sector.For passive income, Merck carries a forward yield of 2.65%. Again, it’s not the most generous yield, though it does beat the healthcare sector’s average metric of 1.58%. Significantly, its payout ratio sits at a very sustainable 34.48%, making MRK one of the steady stocks to consider.Safe Stocks: Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comA membership-only big-box retailer, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) also makes a relatively easy case for safe stocks to buy. Again, because of its membership-only business, Costco caters to a wealthier shopper base. You can dissect the details of demographic comparisons yourself. For this discussion, it’s suffice to say that your average Costco member is much better off than the typical big-box retail consumer.Fundamentally, this framework should afford COST superior economic insulation. Don’t get me wrong – if the economy really tumbles badly, that’s going to be bad news for pretty much everyone. However, if we’re talking about a rough but survivable landing, investors can have confidence with COST stock.For example, Costco enjoys a robust balance sheet, with a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.52x beating nearly 73% of its rivals. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate impresses at 14%. In full disclosure, COST doesn’t provide much in terms of passive income (a forward yield of 0.76%). However, it is a strong buy among Wall Street analysts, who anticipate a $582.35 price tag. That implies 9% upside potential.Monster Beverage (MNST)Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comPerhaps a bit of an oddity for safe stocks to buy, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) carries hidden potential. Yes, I understand that shares have already increased about 29% or so in the past 365 days. Also, beverage companies aren’t the sexiest enterprises available. And if you’re going to invest in this space looking for steady stocks, you might go for the iconic names.However, Monster resonates with young people. To be clear, I understand that controversies have resulted from this directed marketing. Nevertheless, the broader point is that Monster has a foothold with the younger Millennial and the entire Generation Z crowd. It can continue to leverage this positioning, which is why I’m not terribly concerned about its 42x trailing earnings multiple.Instead, I’m focused on its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.5% along with its trailing-year net margin of 21.45%. Also, if you want to focus on all-weather stocks, Monster carries zero debt. There’s no dividend here but it is a strong buy among analysts. Further, the average price target lands at $63.71, implying over 11% upside potential.Safe Stocks: Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA downstream energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) focuses on the marketing and refining component of the industry’s value chain. Fundamentally, the company should be in prime position to advantage social normalization trends. As you’ve no doubt seen yourself, traffic volume has steadily climbed back toward pre-pandemic norms. While the data isn’t quite there yet, one catalyst could change everything.While the year of the COVID-19 pandemic was all about remote work, this year, major corporations are focused on returning back to the office. Because companies can now identify what’s actually going on with workers back in their cubicles, those that implement return-to-office policies may see a productivity lift. And that may force corporate peers to respond in kind, especially amid troubling economic circumstances.Cynically, this is all music to PSX’s ears. And that makes it one of the safe stocks to consider. Lastly, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $127.58 price target, implying 12% upside potential.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, food manufacturing firm Kellogg (NYSE:K) is a boring enterprise. That’s not just a random pejorative statement. According to TipRanks, K stock carries a consensus analyst view of hold. In addition, this assessment breaks down into two buys, seven holds and two sell ratings. That’s a type of symmetry that I normally wouldn’t celebrate, even if the average price target (of $70.40) implies about 15% upside potential.Nevertheless, K makes a strong case for safe stocks to buy. First, as a food company, Kellogg benefits from permanent demand. And as a grocery aisle king, Kellogg benefits from the trade-down effect. Put another way, people will choose to buy groceries over dining out during financially troubling times.Second, Kellogg addresses the popular plant-based meat market with its Morningstar Farms and Incogmeato brands. Finally, the company offers a generous forward yield of 3.92%. As well, the payout ratio sits at a reasonably sustainable 56.07%. Therefore, it’s one of the all-weather stocks to buy.Duke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOn paper from a financial perspective, utility giant Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) may not seem a viable candidate for one of the safe stocks. For instance, the company’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.01x, worse than 95% of its peers. With an Altman Z-Score of only 0.6, Duke – by the underlying formulation – represents a significantly distressed enterprise. It also trades at 55.23X trailing earnings, unfavorably higher than 91% of its peers.At the same time, I’m more interested in profitability. Featuring an operating margin of nearly 23%, Duke beats out 77.64% of its peers. More importantly, over the past decade, Duke delivered 10 years of net income. Essentially, the utility can get away with a lot because of its natural monopoly. Would-be competitors don’t even bother because of the high barriers to entry. So, Duke does what it does.On a broader level, the company benefits from millennial migration trends. Primarily, Duke operates in states that young people are moving to, giving it an advantage over other steady stocks. Stated differently, Duke operates where the money is going.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

There are certainly some storm clouds on the horizon thanks to the Fed’s tight monetary policy and a potentially slowing economy. That said, the recent decline has created some oversold short squeeze stock opportunities.Not all highly shorted stocks are good buy-the-dip candidates. After all, bears are sometimes on to something with their bets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut with these seven short squeeze stocks, there are strong underlying fundamentals to these firms which could power large rallies going forward.All seven of these stocks have at least 5% of their float sold short today, making for plenty of squeeze potential when sentiment turns.Airbnb (ABNB)Girl holding smartphone with Airbnb app on screen. City and bay with some boats in the background. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ABNB Stock.Source: Diego Thomazini / ShutterstockAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a leading online hospitality platform. The firm has become a key player in the so-called sharing economy, allowing homeowners to earn extra income by leasing out their properties on a short-term basis.While Airbnb hasn’t totally displaced hotels, it has created a significant alternative to the traditional hospitality experience. Proving especially popular with younger travelers, it appears Airbnb should have a long runway to continue to expand its total addressable market.That said, there are current fears around what some are deeming an “Airbnbust.” However, more nuanced data analysis shows that overall bookings are up. And while some markets are struggling, on balance, the platform continues to deliver strong results for its partners.Despite that, ABNB stock has sold off recently. This has pushed ABNB stock down to just 33 times forward earnings, which is not too bad for a fast-growing, well known online brand like this one.Once fears around a potential travel slowdown pass, this is one of the short squeeze stocks set to move higher.Story continuesAlbemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a North Carolina-based specialty chemical company. In recent years, Albemarle has specialized in lithium production, making it a key player in the emerging electric vehicle battery supply chain.Albemarle has a long and profitable history; indeed, it has raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years, which is quite the record for a company which critics might brush off as a boom/bust chemical outfit.Yet, bears are now hounding the company once again. There are two primary reasons for this. One, lithium prices have plunged this year among an economic slowdown in China. That’s an honest short-term concern, but shouldn’t affect the longer-term adoption of lithium batteries.Second, western media outlets rushed to report that Chile was threatening to nationalize its lithium industry, where Albemarle has a large piece of its operations.These accounts were largely walked back later; Chile is actually proposing something closer to a public-private partnership. Besides, Chile’s unpopular president doesn’t have the votes in the legislature to make anything much happen.Regardless, the damage was done and ALB stock is down roughly 35% over the past year. This makes income champion one of the better short squeeze stocks out there.Unity Software (U)In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) operates one of the two primary independent graphics engines for the video gaming industry.Despite the crash in the firm’s stock price, it continues to grow revenues at more than 20%/year, and I expect that it may do so for most of the 2020s.Combine its rapid top-line growth rate with the fact that the company is already modestly profitable, and there are good traits here.Short sellers are attracted to Unity for several reasons. They worry about its reliance on lower-quality advertising for much of its revenues.Unity has thus far struggled to develop other commercially monetized uses for the software outside of the video gaming market.That said, the core product is great. And there are multiple ways to win, such as if the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) VR product, in partnership with Unity graphics, starts to become a mainstream success.Unity is among the high risk/high reward short squeeze stocks at its current valuation. That said, shares could skyrocket if shorts head for the exits following an upbeat earnings report.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockAirBnb isn’t the only company cashing in on the travel and leisure boom. There’s also Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:HST).Host is the largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) in America and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.Host owns 72 properties U.S. hotels and five more overseas adding up to more than 40,000 rooms. It operates hotels for brands such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Hyatt, and many more.Host shares bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 as travelers returned in large numbers. However, Host has now seen its momentum slip. With traders fearing a potential recession, HST stock has dipped to near 52-week lows today.That puts shares at just eight times forward funds from operations (P/FFO) while offering a 3.3% dividend yield.MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX)A graphic of a person's hands resting on a laptop with a stock line graph moving through it. top tech stocksSource: ShutterstockMarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) is a leading digital bond trading platform.Historically, fixed income was the last major financial market to move from physical and phone-based trading to digital solutions.This makes sense as bonds are less standardized than stocks, options, or futures. Bonds often have different clauses, covenants, and other such quirks that lead folks to want to trade them in-person rather than on a screen.That said, the pandemic and the related remote work movement forced a lot of bond trading onto digital platforms at last. This has led to a major growth opportunity for MarketAxess and its chief rival, Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW).MarketAxess grew its revenues from $436 million in 2018 to an estimated $770 million this year. As happened with many digital platforms, however, traders got way too excited, causing MKTX stock to nearly double during the peak of the work-from-home era.Now, though, MarketAxess has become oversold. Shares are down by more than half from their all-time highs even as the company continues to quickly grow and is highly profitable. Bears have overstayed their welcome, and MarketAxess could be primed for a major short squeeze.Zions Bancorporation (ZION)Golden light shining from crack of door on black safe with black background, representing bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/marozhka studioZions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) is a leading Rocky Mountains-focused regional bank based out of Salt Lake City.Not surprisingly, ZION stock got caught up in the regional banking scare earlier this year. But that panic appears to be unfounded.That’s because Zions operates as a commercial bank, providing services to small- and mid-sized businesses. In return, those business owners keep their commercial non-interest-bearing accounts at Zions branches to maintain their customer relationship.This ensures that Zions has access to a large and stable low-cost deposit base. Recent figures bore this out.As of June 30, 2023, Zions’ total deposits increased $5.1 billion, or 7%, from March 31, 2023 thanks to a rise in both customer and brokered deposits.While other regional banks have seen deposits leave their branches, Zions’ differentiated business model has stood out this year.ZION stock has bounced from a low of $18 to $35 thanks to its upbeat earnings and deposit data. However, there is plenty more room to run, as shares traded as high as $60 last year. The stock also offers a generous 4.8% dividend yield today.Sabre Corp. (SABR)Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight.Source: Olena Yakobchuk / ShutterstockSabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the three primary global distribution systems for airlines, passenger railroads, hotels and other types of transportation and hospitality ticketing and reservations.These essentially serve as a marketplace platform for the travel industry. Airlines, passenger railroads, cruise lines, and so on can post their itineraries and pricing on Sabre’s GDS.Then travel agents, online booking sites, corporate travel planners and so on can view all the competitive offerings and book the one that best serves their needs. Sabre, in turn, earns a cut of that transaction.Sabre had invested heavily in its information technology platform just prior to the pandemic. This proved to be dreadful timing, as the company was left with a mountain of debt and no cash flow coming in.However, SABR stock now appears to be turning the corner. As travel has come roaring back, Sabre’s cash flow picture is improving.Meanwhile, Sabre’s now modernized IT systems should provide significant cost savings going forward. As Sabre returns to profitability, it could set off the powder keg that is Sabre’s 13% short interest.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ZION, ALB, and U stock.

52,491f1dfa-f15e-3c11-9991-7df8c31a4a91,LUV,2023-09-05,"Why flight delays and cancellations could become the new normal, according to 2 former FAA administrators",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-flight-delays-cancellations-could-104255981.html,1693824175,STORY,['LUV'],"[Recently, finger-pointing between airlines and the Department of Transportation (DOT) has become fashionable. Unfortunately, consumers are the ones getting poked in the eye.The U.S. air travel network, despite its complexity, is the safest in the world. Scheduled commercial passenger airlines haven’t experienced a major fatal crash since 2009, and, over the past 25 years, government and industry have worked together to reduce fatality risk for commercial aviation by more than 95%. During this time, constant partnership and data-sharing through voluntary safety programs provided the impetus for tremendous improvements in aviation safety.The hard-won success of collaboration between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and private entities like commercial airlines goes well beyond safety. In 2022, the industry raised congestion concerns in Florida’s airspace just as the aviation system was reaching for recovery from COVID-related disruptions. The resulting dialogue between the industry and the FAA led to the establishment of a working group to address these concerns, ultimately improving operational performance and yielding fewer delays and cancellations. Similar efforts are underway in Las Vegas and Denver.This essential collaboration has also been evident for years in the ongoing engagement between FAA and industry throughout the implementation of NextGen technologies. This year, a spate of runway incursions led to the creation of the FAA Safety Summit, which brought together industry, labor, and government, resulting in the launch of new safety programs, including the Stand Up for Safety air traffic controller training.The bottom line is that these successes cannot be taken for granted. Achieving results requires building trust and a shared commitment to improvement from government and industry. Yet recently, the DOT has upset the balance of this collaboration by taking an outsized role. Instead of using enforcement as a tool of last resort when collaboration does not work, the DOT is creating an unnecessarily antagonistic working relationship that consumes precious resources and hurts consumers.Story continuesWhile making headlines, DOT actions by no means guarantee material, long-term improvements to passengers’ experiences. Carriers hold themselves to a higher standard than the government ever could. Some recent DOT actions could have the opposite effect of diverting resources away from a company’s ability to innovate and invest in enhancing operations and the overall customer experience.Take the significant Southwest Airlines disruption that left millions of customers stranded last December. Taking responsibility for its actions, Southwest took matters into its own hands by going beyond regulatory requirements to take care of its customers. What ultimately quieted the storm were the actions the carrier took to reset its operations and its willingness to do right by its customers and collaborate openly and transparently with the DOT as normal operations resumed. This work is not done by any means, and, like safety, it's a continuous improvement journey.As airlines prioritize their customers day in and out, it’s crucial they have a strong partner within the federal government. This means using precedent as a guide and getting the federal government back to working with industry to its full collaborative potential, which we have historically seen undergird consumer protection. We are hopeful Mike Whitaker, who is anticipated to be nominated by President Joe Biden to lead the FAA, will serve as a catalyst for collaboration as we move forward.The DOT should also be introspective. As demonstrated by the FAA’s NOTAM system outage in January, years of funding shortfalls mean the FAA’s capital budget must be supported for system modernization. Another example is the need to expedite the FAA’s plan to reallocate the airspace sector around Newark to Philadelphia Approach Control, which will greatly improve operations at many airports up and down the East Coast–and even across the country.Any outage on the federal government’s part has a much larger impact on consumers than the failure of any one airline, though the ultimate win will come when DOT, FAA, and commercial airlines recalibrate their focus toward the very purpose of air travel: for passengers to arrive safely at their destination, on-time, with their baggage.With the sheer number of uncontrollable factors–be it Nor’easters or Canadian wildfires–increasingly constraining U.S. air travel as demand continues to grow, navigating the skies is only becoming more complex. We’re seeing how weather has cascading effects that disrupt flights thousands of miles away.Additionally, critical federal aviation employees–such as air traffic control personnel and meteorologists–are in high demand, and staffing issues are exacerbating delays and cancellations.The unfortunate reality is that air travel is only going to get more challenging due to these constraints. If we don’t work together to act now, it will only get out of hand: Delays, cancellations, and lost baggage will become the status quo. It’s time to reverse course and re-invigorate the FAA’s role as a collaborative partner while empowering airlines to go above and beyond for their customers. Today, that collaboration is more important than ever.Steve Dickson is a former United States Air Force and Delta Air Lines pilot who rose to serve as Delta’s senior VP of flight operations. In August 2019, he began his service as the Federal Aviation Administrator following the Boeing 737 MAX groundings. Dickson retired from the FAA in 2022 after 43 years in the aviation industry.Randy Babbitt served as Federal Aviation Administrator from 2009 to 2011. Prior to his tenure at the FAA, he was President of the Air Line Pilots Association–leading the largest airline pilot union in the U.S. and Canada, an Eastern Air Lines pilot, and an aviation industry consultant. At the end of his tenure at the FAA, he joined Southwest Airlines as the SVP of Labor Relations, where he served for four years until his retirement after 50 years in the commercial aviation industry.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

The upside can be linked primarily to strength in the Application Software segment and benefits from the acquisition of Frontline Education.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving the Stock?Roper’s Application Software segment is benefiting from strength across its Deltek, Vertafore and Aderant businesses. Robust SaaS offerings and high retention rates are aiding Deltek. The acquisition of Replicon, expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2023, will bolster Deltek’s growth by boosting its SaaS solutions portfolio. The buyout is expected to contribute $70 million to revenues and $24 million to EBITDA in 2024.Record bookings and growing adoption and cross-selling of SaaS solutions are key catalysts to Aderant’s growth. The MGA systems acquisition and strength across the Clinisys, Data Innovations and Strata businesses are fueling growth of Vertafore. Roper expects organic revenues to increase in mid-single digits for the Application Software segment in the second half of 2023.The Network Software and Technology Enabled Products segments are also holding up well. Strong retention and customer expansion activity and strength across the Foundry business are fostering growth of the Network Software segment. The company expects mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in the second half of 2023.Improving supply chains and solid performance of Neptune business due to increased demand for residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters are fostering growth of the Tech-enabled Products segment. Solid performance of Verathon due to strength across reoccurring single-use products and bladder scan capital purchases bodes well for the segment. ROP expects high-single-digit organic growth for the segment in the second half of 2023.Roper’s bullish guidance for 2023 bears testimony to the strength across its businesses. For 2023, the company expects total revenues to increase around 13% year over year. Organic revenues are estimated to increase 7%. Adjusted earnings are predicted to be $16.36-$16.50 per share compared with $16.10-$16.30 expected earlier.Roper aims to expand its operations through strategic acquisitions. In August, the company acquired cloud-based performance management and data solutions provider, Syntellis Performance Solutions, for $1.25 billion. The buyout expands the company’s Strata Decision Technology business, which is part of the Application Software segment.  In October 2022, Roper acquired Frontline Education for $3.7 billion. The acquisition builds on ROP’s Horizon software business (which it acquired in 2008), expanding its presence in the K-12 education market. Acquisitions boosted sales by 8% in the second quarter.Roper’s consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends are also expected to have boosted its shares. In the first six months of 2023, ROP rewarded its shareholders with a dividend payment of $144.8 million, up 10.8% year over year. Strong cash flow generation capacity supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. In the second quarter of 2023, the company generated free cash flow of $295 million, up 17% year over year.Story continuesWill the Uptrend Last?With strong market conditions, Roper anticipates continued strength across its businesses. Improving supply chains and synergies from acquisitions are expected to boost the company’s performance. ROP expects Frontline Education to contribute approximately $370 million to its revenues and $175 million to its EBITDA in 2023.

And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Roper Technologies (ROP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Roper Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ROP that show why this industrial equipment maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ROP, shares are up 0.96% over the past week while the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry is up 2.96% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 2.64% compares favorably with the industry's 0.28% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Roper Technologies have risen 10.57%, and are up 24.6% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.37% and 15.49%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ROP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ROP is currently averaging 294,600 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ROP.Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ROP's consensus estimate, increasing from $16.25 to $16.46 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ROP is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Roper Technologies on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned +4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +22.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +25.1% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $32.91 billion and $36.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.2% and +11.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(HOLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-attracting-investor-130010929.html,1693832410,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -1.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has lost 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 points to a change of -34.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $941.83 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. The $4.03 billion and $4.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.2% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $957.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TJX) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Carol Meyrowitz is the biggest insider sale of TJX Companies shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$92.64). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 32% of Carol Meyrowitz's stake.Insiders in TJX Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).TJX Companies Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at TJX Companies. In total, insiders dumped US$10m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of TJX CompaniesFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. TJX Companies insiders own about US$154m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At TJX Companies Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since TJX Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

Gen Z, generally defined as those born after 1997, has become a powerful demographic with over $360 billion in purchasing power as of 2021, according to Bloomberg.""They are the ones that are setting cultural touchstones,"" Hitha Herzog, H Squared Research chief retail analyst, told Yahoo Finance. ""They are the ones that talk about and share trends and they are the one that creates a buzz and with that sort of force, and it's almost like built-in marketing. Once you get the interest of that younger generation, that is what is going to kind of create that tsunami of business.""Social media plays a large role in product discovery for younger shoppers. And once a certain item takes off, young people are inclined to buy.A recent survey from Charles Schwab of 880 Americans found that 55% of Gen Z respondents said they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. Millennials' purchases were also influenced by social media (at 46%) followed by Gen X (27%) and baby boomers (10%).Yet, young people who just started working have less disposable income to spend.A survey from GoBankingRates that polled 1,000 adults revealed that about 61% of young adults 18 to 24 have $1,000 or less in their savings, while 31% have $100 or less.So how do they have the spending power? According to Herzog, it depends.""There's a lot of factors, but a lot of this generation is probably living at home still or living in situations where they don't have a lot of overhead costs to have to pay for,"" she said. ""A lot of that disposable income is going towards buying merchandise.""Story continuesFrancesca Murray, Hannah Jensen, Jonathan Garcia, Brianna Marquez, Monica Veloz, Kimberly Solis, Christine Kong, Loreen Hwang, and Maiya Nicole attend Sephora at Kohl's VIP event at Mira Loma Kohls on Aug. 11, 2022 in Mira Loma, Calif.

CEO Tom Kingsbury told investors the addition of Sephora inside locations is a driver of the business since young people are flocking to it.""The Sephora business has been incredibly good,"" Kingsbury said, adding that locations with a Sephora made more sales. ""It's pretty remarkable. ... It's bringing in a younger, more diverse consumer as well. But it's been really a driver, and we're moving right along.""Kohl's, which has struggled in recent years, is now tasked with getting shoppers who come for Charlotte Tilbury or Rare Beauty cosmetics to shop further into the stores. Kingsbury added the retailer sees an opportunity to expand the young women's business as well as home decor and gifting.Even Forever 21, once a go-to for tweens and teens at the mall, teamed up with e-commerce giant Shein, which is known for drawing young consumers with its cheap prices.How can investors can play this?For investors with a longer horizon who want to tap into this theme, Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih shared the retail stocks she is keeping a close eye on over the next six months and beyond.Want to jump on a brand that is gaining social media hype with innovation and new products? Look into Lululemon (LULU) or Nike (NKE), Yih said.Lululemon has ""comfortable, innovative newness that they’re bringing to the consumer, and they’re marketing that to these younger consumers, specifically,"" Piper Sandler analyst Abbie Zvejnieks told Yahoo Finance on Friday. ""It’s why I think they’re positioned well for back-to-school. We’re seeing a lot of social media marketing, leveraging those TikTok influencers.""For brands that are stretching the dollar or easing wallet pressure with Gen Z, Barclays thinks off-price retailers are the way to play it, such as TJ Maxx (TJX) or Ross Stores (ROST).And if you're looking to get into companies that tap into secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness, activewear, and beauty, think about Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Lululemon, Ulta (ULTA), or Nike.Yet, according to Herzog, the push to connect with younger consumers is playing out at retailers across the board.""That is the demographic that everyone wants to get in with,"" Herzog said.

""They really didn't get the traction they expected.""The FTC in July abandoned its bid to block Microsoft's $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard, after earlier losing a fight to stop Meta Platforms from buying virtual reality content maker Within Unlimited.Amgen's acquisition of Horizon was the first biotech deal challenged since the FTC's 2021 launch of a pharmaceutical merger task force, which has been followed by workshops designed to explore concerns over increased industry consolidation.The settlement ""is likely a win for Amgen,"" which will avoid any potential break-up fee payment, said Evan Seigerman, a senior research analyst at BMO Capital Markets.With Horizon, Amgen acquires drugs that won't be affected by new U.S. negotiation requirements for blockbuster medications as well as possible tax advantages stemming from Horizon's headquarters in Ireland.Story continuesThe FTC, led by Lina Khan, a progressive, on Friday dropped its opposition to the $27.8 billion deal, stipulating settlement terms that largely reflected Amgen's offer in June not to use Horizon's rare disease drugs, which are administered by healthcare professionals, as leverage to secure better sales terms for products that are dispensed at pharmacies.TAX SITUATIONThe deal, now expected to close early in the fourth quarter, will help Amgen to diversify, adding two commercial products - thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa - along with experimental drugs.""They are essentially buying an orphan drug portfolio,"" Yaron Werber, an analyst at TD Cowen, told Reuters. Horizon's drugs, and those Amgen acquired in last year's ChemoCentryx deal, are not subject to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) enacted by the Biden administration in 2022, he explained.Orphan status, which includes an exclusive marketing period and potentially faster approvals, is granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to encourage development of drugs for rare conditions.The IRA requires the U.S. Medicare health program that covers 66 million people to, for the first time ever, negotiate prices for drugs it spends the most on. Medications for rare diseases, however, are exempt.The recently released list of the initial 10 prescription medicines subject to the price negotiations includes Amgen's arthritis drug Enbrel, which had 2022 sales of $4.1 billion.Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, in a recent research note, said the IRA could encourage more pharmaceutical deals as larger firms look to avoid exposure to Medicare and instead seek out smaller companies with rare disease portfolios.The pharmaceutical industry has warned that the new law will have unintended consequences, including incentives for drugmakers to develop complex biologic treatments rather than chemically synthesized drugs that are easier to manufacture.Analysts said the Horizon deal could also help Amgen's tax situation.The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has accused Amgen of underpaying billions in back taxes from 2010 to 2015, mainly by attributing what should have been U.S. taxable income to a Puerto Rico manufacturing unit.The United States has largely eliminated once-lucrative corporate tax benefits for pharmaceutical manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.But if a drug is made in Ireland, one of the world's largest exporters of medicines, U.S. parent companies can reduce taxes by shifting profits to an Irish manufacturing subsidiary.Horizon offers Amgen ""potentially a better tax jurisdiction related to Irish manufacturing plants ... Amgen has a new manufacturing process they could potentially move there,"" Cowen's Werber said.(Reporting By Deena Beasley; editing by Peter Henderson and Paul Simao)]"

Amgen also cannot use any product rebate or contract term to exclude or disadvantage any product that would compete with those drugs.Amgen will be required to get the FTC’s permission to buy any competitor to the two HZNP drugs till 2032.In response to the above settlement, Amgen issued a statement that these terms would not impact the company’s business. Following this resolution, the company expects the acquisition to be completed early in fourth-quarter 2023. Shares of both Amgen and Horizon rose on Sep 1 following these announcements.In the year so far, Horizon Therapeutics’ shares have gained 1.3%, while Amgen’s shares have lost 2.3%. During the same period, the industry has declined 11.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe news comes just days after the FTC, through a Federal Court filing, temporarily suspended its lawsuit to block the Amgen/Horizon Therapeutics deal. The agency took this decision to pause to consider whether it should settle the case or enter into negotiations with Amgen and Horizon.Last December, Amgen announced that it would acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.50 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. However, the FTC filed a lawsuit in May 2023 alleging that the acquisition could help Amgen leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for Tepezza and Krystexxa if allowed to go through. In its lawsuit, the agency contended that both these drugs face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.Story continuesAmgen Inc. Price Amgen Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed introduction to the gold industry and just want to take a look at some more ETFs, go directly to the 5 Best Gold ETFs.Gold stands as one of the most ancient investment assets known in history. While some investors hold unwavering faith in its worth, others hold a contrary opinion. That said, it's hard to dispute the distinctive role the precious metal occupies in markets – serving as a store of value that sets it apart from nearly all other assets. Gold functions as a safe-haven metal that provides a hedge against various risks, including geopolitical upheavals, and financial turmoil. This occurs because investors seek a secure asset to safeguard their buying power and as a hedge against the erosion of the value of national currencies such as the US dollar. Similar to any commodity, the price of gold is subject to the forces of supply and demand. Gold serves multiple purposes beyond merely being a store of value or an investment. Substantial portions of gold demand are attributed to its use in jewelry and various industrial applications, including electronics and medical devices. Consequently, shifts in the growth or contraction of these industries will invariably impact the demand for gold.Nonetheless, in recent months, numerous individuals have raised doubts about gold's role as a hedge against inflation. The price of gold has exhibited significant volatility, mirroring the turbulent fluctuations of the markets due to shifts in interest rates, geopolitical challenges, and evolving market projections. During the past year alone, gold has surged, reaching a value exceeding $2,000 per ounce in early 2023.In June, both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) opted to raise interest rates. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its target rate unchanged, allowing the impacts of the tightening cycle to gradually permeate the real economy. While concerns about a recession have diminished somewhat, they are not completely eliminated. In such periods, the inherent value of gold becomes notably more appealing than alternative investments like stocks and bonds. While the appeal of other stocks and bonds wanes, there's an expectation of strong performance from gold stocks due to the increasing demand for the precious metal. A report from Bloomberg referenced information provided by Invesco, revealing that global sovereign wealth funds and investors are accumulating gold. Invesco based its findings on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively overseeing approximately $21 trillion in assets. In relation to gold, the report stated, ""A significant portion of central banks express apprehension about the precedent established by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) concurring that this incident has heightened the attractiveness of gold."" The survey findings underscored that gold's role as an inflation hedge persists, with a noteworthy portion of central banks planning to increase their gold holdings over the upcoming three years.Story continuesIn its gold outlook report for March 2023, fund management company Wisdom Tree suggested that while gold may reach a nominal high this year, achieving a ""real"" high remains a distant prospect. The report indicated that, even in the most optimistic scenario, gold prices are expected to remain approximately 11% below the inflation-adjusted peaks witnessed during the 1980s. Wisdom Tree noted that if inflation were to decrease significantly (Siegal Case), and the Federal Reserve were to successfully control it earlier than anticipated, gold could see an increase in value. In addition, the report highlighted that gold faced challenges in 2022 due to a strong US dollar. However, in the current year, the precious metal has experienced a resurgence in response to the depreciation of the dollar's value. Wisdom Tree also pointed out that the prevailing consensus suggests that inflation will continue its decline throughout 2023, and both the US dollar and bond yields are expected to decrease as well.Furthermore, there is a notable sense of optimism surrounding the revenue and production prospects for H2 2023 among firms such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). During the Q2 2023 earnings conference call, Tom Palmer, the CEO of Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), expressed:“As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tonnes mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tonnes mined Cerro Negro is the first wave of our district expansion which comes online in the third quarter. Higher tonnes mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter.”10 Best Gold ETFsOur MethodologyWe have curated a collection of ETFs that grant access to gold stocks spanning different market capitalizations, including large-, mid-, and small-cap firms.

As an example, this could encompass entities like the iShares Gold Trust. As of August 18, the fund's Expense Ratio stood at 0.34%.9. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX)5-Year Performance as of August 20: 44.85%The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) aims to closely mimic, prior to deducting fees and expenses, the price and yield progress of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR). This index is designed to monitor the comprehensive performance of businesses engaged in the gold mining sector. Although not directly tied to physical gold, this investment avenue provides investors with diversified access to major publicly traded gold mining enterprises.The portfolio encompasses 51 mining companies, featuring notable names such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), a prominent mining firm with a primary emphasis on gold. The company is also engaged in the extraction of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. Its gold mining operations are distributed across various countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Australia, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, and the Republic of Suriname.In the second quarter of 2023, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) was a part of the portfolios of 49 hedge funds, with a collective valuation of $652.58 million.

Over the past year, the stock has gained 28.9%, outperforming the industry’s 16.8% growth.Mastercard — with a market cap of $391.6 billion — is a leading global payment solutions company that provides an array of services in support of credit, debit, mobile, web-based and contactless payments, and other related electronic payment programs to financial institutions and other entities.Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mastercard’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $12.13 per share, indicating a 13.9% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The estimate remained stable over the past week. MA’s earnings beat estimates in all the last four quarters, the average being 3.2%. This is depicted in the graph below.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMastercard Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteFurthermore, the consensus mark for revenues is $25.2 billion for 2023, indicating a 13.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. Increasing Payments Network Net Revenues and Value-added Services and Solutions Net Revenues are bound to support the top-line growth.Our estimate for Payments Network Net Revenue indicates a nearly 13% year-over-year increase. Similarly, we expect Value-added Services and Solutions Net Revenues to jump 13.6% from the year-ago reported level. Rising transactions, GDV, prudent growth strategies and strategic partnerships are likely to continue boosting MA’s performance.We expect 2023 processed transaction volumes to jump 11.6% year over year. Further, our estimate suggests gross dollar volume or GDV to rise 9.7% year over year, backed by strength in the U.S., Europe and Latin America operations.Story continuesThe company’s focus on expanding operations in growing regions positions it well for long-term growth. Also, its strategic alliances and partnerships are major positives. Some important partnerships in recent times include those with HealthLock, pan-European Commercial Bank, UniCredit, Canada-based fintech Nuvei, Zanzibar e-Government Agency, and many others.Its focus on product updates and new innovative product launches brings more and more traffic to its network. It introduced the ALT ID solution for paving the way for seamless and secured guest checkout transactions across India. To promote hassle-free money transfers in the UAE, MA teamed up with Checkout.com and Careem. Such deals are expected to continue in the coming days.Key ConcernsHowever, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on.Rising expenses, high rebates and incentives are likely to drag MA's margins. In 2023, we expect adjusted operating expenses to escalate nearly 11% from the prior-year comparable period’s figure. Also, growing competition in the payment market can affect its growth trajectory. The Credit Card Competition Act’s proposed measure is expected to increase competition through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector are Paysafe Limited PSFE, PagSeguro Digital Ltd.

91,c66262ce-bc28-3297-96b5-240ddede53d1,PHM,2023-09-05,"Is Trending Stock PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-pultegroup-inc-phm-130011037.html,1693832411,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned -2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share, indicating a change of +3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.62 points to a change of +7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +0.8% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.4%. The $16.49 billion and $17.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +5.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The LTFU study was conducted from 2009 through 2021 across 13 countries and five continents.""These data highlight the importance of GARDASIL 9 in prevention of certain HPV-related cancers and diseases later in life,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""HPV-related cancers and diseases are a significant public health issue. These strong study results serve as a reminder that we need to do everything we can to expand and recover vaccination rates globally to help protect all eligible people from certain HPV-related cancers.""In the U.S., GARDASIL 9 is indicated for use in females 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11. GARDASIL 9 is also indicated for use in males 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11. The oropharyngeal and head and neck cancer indication is approved under accelerated approval based on effectiveness in preventing HPV-related anogenital disease. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. The confirmatory trial is ongoing. GARDASIL 9 is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].Story continuesGARDASIL 9 targets HPV types that cause approximately 80% of cervical cancers. Additionally, HPV is responsible for causing genital warts and certain types of vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. For most people, HPV clears on its own, but for those who don’t clear the virus it could lead to certain cancers and other diseases.As part of the primary objective of immunogenicity, data showed sustained HPV-antibody responses at 10 years after the third dose in boys and girls. Across GARDASIL 9-targeted HPV types, antibody assessments evaluated through geometric mean titers peaked at Month 7 and decreased thereafter through 126 months. The vast majority of study participants remained seropositive at the end of the study period; 99.6% to 100% of study participants were seropositive for the targeted HPV types at Month 7 based on HPV-9 competitive Luminex® immunoassay (cLIA), and 81.3% to 97.7% remained seropositive at Month 126 depending on the HPV type. Based on the HPV-9 immunoglobulin G Luminex immunoassay (IgG-LIA), 94.9% to 100% of participants were seropositive at Month 126.In accordance with the study’s secondary objective, incidence of persistent infection and disease related to vaccine-targeted HPV types was assessed in the per-protocol population in both female and male participants. Female participants were followed up to 11.0 years post the third dose (median 10.0 years), and male participants were followed up to 10.6 years post the third dose (median 9.9 years).Among girls, there were no cases of vaccine-targeted HPV type high-grade disease – cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS), vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) – certain cancers (cervical, vulvar, vaginal), or external genital warts observed;One case of CIN1 tested positive for HPV 16, 39 and 59 was observed at Month 84. Cervical cytology results were negative at subsequent visits;In boys, there were no cases of vaccine-targeted HPV type disease (penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)), certain studied cancers (penile, perineal, perianal) or external genital warts observed. GARDASIL 9 is not approved for the prevention of HPV-related PIN, penile, perineal or perianal cancers.No GARDASIL 9-related serious adverse events or deaths were reported throughout the LTFU study. The most common reasons for discontinuations from the LTFU study were due to participant withdrawal or loss to follow-up.HPV will infect most sexually active males and females in their lifetime. For most people, HPV clears on its own, but for those who don’t clear the virus it could lead to certain cancers and other diseases. In the United States, the CDC estimated that tens of thousands of people were diagnosed with certain HPV-related cancers each year from 2015-2019. And worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. There is no way to know which people who have HPV will develop cancer or other health problems. With the exception of cervical cancer, there is no routinely recommended screening for the detection of HPV-related cancers.About the studyThe Phase 3 immunogenicity study for GARDASIL 9 in boys and girls aged 9–15 years was extended to a LTFU study to assess immunogenicity through 10 years after the last GARDASIL 9 vaccine dose. The LTFU study was conducted at 40 sites across 13 countries: Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand and USA. There were 1,272 participants (971 girls, 301 boys) enrolled in the LTFU study. Analysis of the per-protocol population included 872 girls and 262 boys who completed the GARDASIL 9 vaccination series within one year, were seronegative to the relevant HPV type at initiation of the vaccination series and had not initiated sexual activity prior to receiving the third dose of GARDASIL 9.The primary objective of the LTFU study was to evaluate anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 antibody responses through 10 years post the third dose of GARDASIL 9. Secondary objectives were to estimate the long-term incidence of the composite endpoint of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58-related persistent infection (≥6 months duration ±1 month visit window) and disease. Safety assessments during the LTFU study included reporting of all deaths and vaccine-related serious adverse events.Indication for GARDASIL 9GARDASIL 9 is a vaccine indicated in females 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.GARDASIL 9 is indicated in males 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.The oropharyngeal and head and neck cancer indication is approved under accelerated approval based on effectiveness in preventing HPV-related anogenital disease. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.GARDASIL 9 does not eliminate the necessity for vaccine recipients to undergo screening for cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers as recommended by a health care provider.GARDASIL 9 has not been demonstrated to provide protection against diseases caused by:HPV types not covered by the vaccineHPV types to which a person has previously been exposed through sexual activityNot all vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers are caused by HPV, and GARDASIL 9 protects only against those vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.GARDASIL 9 is not a treatment for external genital lesions; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers; or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN), or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN).Vaccination with GARDASIL 9 may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.Select Safety InformationGARDASIL 9 is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant].Because vaccines may develop syncope, sometimes resulting in falling with injury, observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following HPV vaccination. When syncope is associated with tonic-clonic movements, the activity is usually transient and typically responds to restoring cerebral perfusion.Safety and effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 have not been established in pregnant women.The most common (≥10%) local and systemic adverse reactions in females were injection-site pain, swelling, erythema, and headache. The most common (≥10%) local and systemic reactions in males were injection-site pain, swelling, and erythema.The duration of immunity of a 2-dose schedule of GARDASIL 9 has not been established.Dosage and AdministrationGARDASIL 9 should be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or anterolateral area of the thigh.For individuals 9 through 14 years of age, GARDASIL 9 can be administered using a 2-dose or 3-dose schedule. For the 2-dose schedule, the second dose should be administered 6–12 months after the first dose. If the second dose is administered less than 5 months after the first dose, a third dose should be given at least 4 months after the second dose. For the 3-dose schedule, GARDASIL 9 should be administered at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.For individuals 15 through 45 years of age, GARDASIL 9 is administered using a 3-dose schedule at 0, 2 months, and 6 months.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Specifically, Powell said, “We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.”  Since everyone, including the Chairman, believes that the Fed’s current interest rate is “restrictive,” the words “toward our objective” in that sentence apparently mean that the central bank is willing to consider cutting rates if inflation is falling, but is above its 2% nominal target. Moreover, the fact that Powell is willing to consider cutting relatively soon likely means that — absent a major increase in inflation — the Fed is done raising rates. As the market wakes up to that, I expect growth stocks to buy to climb much further.Growth Stocks to Buy: Quanta Services (PWR)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocks. Sleeper Growth StocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockQuanta (NYSE:PWR) builds electrical power stations, infrastructure, and facilities for renewable energy and the transmission of natural gas. With that, Quanta is well-positioned to benefit from the renewable-energy revolution, and the electrification of transportation.Helping, Quanta just delivered “beat-and-raise” fiscal first quarter results. Revenues jumped 20% year over year, as its net income jumped to $1.12, one-cent above the mean estimate. With guidance, Quanta increased its sales outlook to $19.6 billion to $20 billion from its previous guidance of $18.40 billion to $18.9 billion. It also hiked its net income guidance to $705 million to $765 million from $692 million to $766 million. In addition, the company has a record backlog of $27.2 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso, as noted by Quanta CEO Duke Austin, the firm’s strong results were driven by powerful demand from electric utilities, renewable energy generators and “the move towards a reduced-carbon economy.”Story continuesXpeng (XPEV)Xpeng (XPEV) car logo in Shanghai International Automobile Industry ExhibitionSource: THINK A / Shutterstock.comChinese electric-vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) announced that it formed a new alliance with Chinese ride-sharing giant DiDi Global (OTCMKTS:DIDIY). The two will create affordable electric vehicles. Moreover, Xpeng stated that “it would explore collaborations with Didi on fleet management, marketing, insurance, charging facilities, robotaxis and international markets.”Such a joint venture, I believe, would be very profitable and would meaningfully boost Xpeng’s financial results, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. Bank of America believes that the deal will boost Xpeng’s brand, and the bank kept a $22 price target and a “buy” rating on the shares.Growth Stocks to Buy: MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comMGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) is benefiting from multiple, strong, positive catalysts, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. Two of the most  catalysts are the expansion of BetMGM, its online sports-betting venture, and the continued revival of Macau, China’s gambling hub.On Aug. 17, MGM disclosed that BetMGM was expanding to the UK. The news shows that, in addition to entering new U.S. states that legalize online betting, it will also penetrate significant overseas markets, which could be a sizable catalyst to its bottom line. Helping, analysts at Jefferies reported that traffic in the Chinese region had reached its highest level in 2023. Further, last month MGM announced a partnership with hotel chain Marriott (NYSE:MAR), which could allow MGM to obtain a significant number of new customers.Workday (WDAY)Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn a previous article, I reported that “Workday’s (NASDAQ:WDAY) cloud applications enable companies to easily manage their finances and human resources functions. It also has apps that allow companies to efficiently analyze their operations and plan initiatives using AI.”On Aug.. 24, Workday reported very strong second-quarter results as its revenue climbed 16% versus the same period a year earlier and its “24-month subscription revenue backlog” soared 23% year-over-year to a very impressive $10.27 billion.” Also noteworthy was that its earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $1.45, 17 cents above analysts’ average estimate and much higher than the 83 cents that it reported in Q2 of 2022.Morgan Stanley was upbeat on WDAY stock in the wake of the results, contending that the company is benefiting from its new products and looks poised to increase its free cash flow at a compound annual growth rate of “25%+ over the next three years.” The bank kept an “overweight” rating on the shares.Growth Stocks to Buy: EVgo (EVGO)EVgo fast charging stationSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comEVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO), one of America’s leading providers of EV chargers, continues to grow. It also continues to make multiple new deals that should enable further growth. Last quarter, the company’s top line soared an incredible 456% versus Q2 of 2022, coming in at $50.6 million, $21 million above analysts’ average estimate. And it reported a loss per share of 8 cents, ten cents above the mean estimate.Also importantly, its customers utilized a record 24.9 gigawatt-hours of electricity, representing a 147% jump versus the same period a year earlier.As far as deals are concerned, EVgo, along with a number of its partners, was selected by Ohio earlier this month to receive $13.8 million. The funds will enable the company to introduce 20 new fast-charging stations in the state.Additionally, the company recently announced that two popular EVs made by Rivian, the rapidly growing electric SUV and truck maker, would be able to start using EVgo’s  Autocharge+,service. The latter service “allows EV drivers to seamlessly initiate a charging session by simply plugging in their vehicle to an EVgo fast charger,” EVgo explained.Powell Industries (POWL)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockPowell Industries (NASDAQ:POWL) sells equipment used by electricity generators. Like Quanta, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the electrification of transportation and Washington’s spending on infrastructure improvements. Additionally, three of the company’s other major end markets –liquid natural gas producers, miners, and datacenters — also have strong, positive catalysts going forward.Last quarter, the company’s revenue soared 42% versus the same period a year earlier to $192 million, while its backlog “nearly tripled to a record $1.3 billion” and its new orders soared $303 million year-over-year to $505 million. “Looking forward, we anticipate continued strength across most of our core end markets into fiscal 2024,” said CFO Michael Metcalf in a statement.Vertiv Holdings (VRT)Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) appears to be benefiting from the rapid expansion of data centers as the amount of data used in our society rapidly expands. This trend should accelerate further as artificial intelligence proliferates. Last quarter, the company’s top line climbed 23.6% versus the same period a year earlier and its operating profit, excluding certain items, jumped $169 million year-over-year to $251 million.The midpoint of the company’s 2023 sales guidance range is  now $6.8 billion, $285 million above its previous outlook. “I am…encouraged by the (company’s) growth acceleration potential, which has just begun in our industry, represented by data center infrastructure necessary to meet the rapidly growing demand for compute capacity driven by AI,” Vertiv CEO Giordano Albertazzi said in a recent press release.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer was long XPEV, MGM, EVGO, and RIVN. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

NNS recorded a year-over-year increase of 5% in revenues in the last reported quarter.Considering the rising demand for submarines in the days ahead, HII may continue to witness a significant order inflow for the construction of new submarines as well as service contracts, like the latest one.

And once a certain item takes off, young people are inclined to buy.A recent survey from Charles Schwab of 880 Americans found that 55% of Gen Z respondents said they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. Millennials' purchases were also influenced by social media (at 46%) followed by Gen X (27%) and baby boomers (10%).Yet, young people who just started working have less disposable income to spend.A survey from GoBankingRates that polled 1,000 adults revealed that about 61% of young adults 18 to 24 have $1,000 or less in their savings, while 31% have $100 or less.So how do they have the spending power?

We’re seeing a lot of social media marketing, leveraging those TikTok influencers.""For brands that are stretching the dollar or easing wallet pressure with Gen Z, Barclays thinks off-price retailers are the way to play it, such as TJ Maxx (TJX) or Ross Stores (ROST).And if you're looking to get into companies that tap into secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness, activewear, and beauty, think about Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Lululemon, Ulta (ULTA), or Nike.Yet, according to Herzog, the push to connect with younger consumers is playing out at retailers across the board.""That is the demographic that everyone wants to get in with,"" Herzog said. ""If you are selling power tools or if you are selling makeup, it doesn't matter. ... That is the generation.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 5/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 0/104. GF Value rank: 4/105.

The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.41, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.9, which is worse than 95% of 900 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 15.63, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.37% of 760 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where VF Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank.

One such stock that merits attention is VF Corp (NYSE:VFC). The stock, which is currently priced at 20.46, recorded a gain of 3.54% in a day and a 3-month increase of 22.08%. The stock's fair valuation is $61.86, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with VF should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 2, Altman Z-score of 1.41, and These indicators suggest that VF, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. VF's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Story continuesBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)VF designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of VF's ProfitabilityLet's delve deeper into VF's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 7.66; 2022: 7.45; 2023: 0.84, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in VF.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendAssessing the aspect of leverage, liquidity, and sources of funds, VF demonstrates an alarming rise in its debt-to-total assets ratio over the past three years. The provided data shows 2021: 0.51; 2022: 0.48; 2023: 0.56, expressed as percentages. A higher debt ratio suggests that VF is increasingly financing its assets through debt, thereby escalating its financial risk. The Piotroski F-Score views this as a negative indicator, further cautioning investors about VF.Is VF (VFC) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapOperating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, VF follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 53.47; 2022: 54.04; 2023: 52.28 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that VF is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.In terms of operational efficiency, another key indicator, VF has unfortunately reported a declining trend in asset turnover over the past three years, as evidenced by the data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 (expressed in percentages). Asset turnover measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales, and a decrease in this ratio can indicate a drop in efficiency. This could be due to various factors, such as underutilization of assets or a decline in the market demand for the company's products or services. Consequently, this downward trend in asset turnover implies that VF may need to revisit its operational strategies to improve the utilization of its assets and boost its sales volume.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for VF, its current score suggests potential troubles. [Summerize those cinterning signals]VF's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of VF's Altman Z-score reveals VF's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating VF's historical data, 2021: 0.02; 2022: 0.01; 2023: 0.00, we observe a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. This downward movement indicates VF's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of VF's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.11; 2023: 0.02) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that VF might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for VF is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.78; 2022: 0.88; 2023: 0.82 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in VF's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite VF's seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Piotroski F-score and Altman Z-score, coupled with declining profitability and operational efficiency, suggest that VF might be a potential value trap. Investors are therefore advised to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Piotroski F-score using the following Screener: Piotroski F-score screener .GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Corporation's (NYSE:VFC) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corporations-nyse-vfc-150007933.html,1693839607,STORY,['VFC'],"[While V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine V.F’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for V.F Is V.F Still Cheap?V.F appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that V.F’s ratio of 67.93x is above its peer average of 14.23x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Luxury industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since V.F’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of V.F look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for V.F. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in VFC’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe VFC should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VFC for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for VFC, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing V.F at this point in time. For example, V.F has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are concerning) we think you should know about.If you are no longer interested in V.F, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

There are certainly some storm clouds on the horizon thanks to the Fed’s tight monetary policy and a potentially slowing economy. That said, the recent decline has created some oversold short squeeze stock opportunities.Not all highly shorted stocks are good buy-the-dip candidates. After all, bears are sometimes on to something with their bets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut with these seven short squeeze stocks, there are strong underlying fundamentals to these firms which could power large rallies going forward.All seven of these stocks have at least 5% of their float sold short today, making for plenty of squeeze potential when sentiment turns.Airbnb (ABNB)Girl holding smartphone with Airbnb app on screen. City and bay with some boats in the background. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ABNB Stock.Source: Diego Thomazini / ShutterstockAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a leading online hospitality platform. The firm has become a key player in the so-called sharing economy, allowing homeowners to earn extra income by leasing out their properties on a short-term basis.While Airbnb hasn’t totally displaced hotels, it has created a significant alternative to the traditional hospitality experience. Proving especially popular with younger travelers, it appears Airbnb should have a long runway to continue to expand its total addressable market.That said, there are current fears around what some are deeming an “Airbnbust.” However, more nuanced data analysis shows that overall bookings are up. And while some markets are struggling, on balance, the platform continues to deliver strong results for its partners.Despite that, ABNB stock has sold off recently. This has pushed ABNB stock down to just 33 times forward earnings, which is not too bad for a fast-growing, well known online brand like this one.Once fears around a potential travel slowdown pass, this is one of the short squeeze stocks set to move higher.Story continuesAlbemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a North Carolina-based specialty chemical company. In recent years, Albemarle has specialized in lithium production, making it a key player in the emerging electric vehicle battery supply chain.Albemarle has a long and profitable history; indeed, it has raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years, which is quite the record for a company which critics might brush off as a boom/bust chemical outfit.Yet, bears are now hounding the company once again. There are two primary reasons for this. One, lithium prices have plunged this year among an economic slowdown in China. That’s an honest short-term concern, but shouldn’t affect the longer-term adoption of lithium batteries.Second, western media outlets rushed to report that Chile was threatening to nationalize its lithium industry, where Albemarle has a large piece of its operations.These accounts were largely walked back later; Chile is actually proposing something closer to a public-private partnership. Besides, Chile’s unpopular president doesn’t have the votes in the legislature to make anything much happen.Regardless, the damage was done and ALB stock is down roughly 35% over the past year. This makes income champion one of the better short squeeze stocks out there.Unity Software (U)In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) operates one of the two primary independent graphics engines for the video gaming industry.Despite the crash in the firm’s stock price, it continues to grow revenues at more than 20%/year, and I expect that it may do so for most of the 2020s.Combine its rapid top-line growth rate with the fact that the company is already modestly profitable, and there are good traits here.Short sellers are attracted to Unity for several reasons. They worry about its reliance on lower-quality advertising for much of its revenues.Unity has thus far struggled to develop other commercially monetized uses for the software outside of the video gaming market.That said, the core product is great. And there are multiple ways to win, such as if the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) VR product, in partnership with Unity graphics, starts to become a mainstream success.Unity is among the high risk/high reward short squeeze stocks at its current valuation. That said, shares could skyrocket if shorts head for the exits following an upbeat earnings report.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockAirBnb isn’t the only company cashing in on the travel and leisure boom. There’s also Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:HST).Host is the largest lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) in America and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.Host owns 72 properties U.S. hotels and five more overseas adding up to more than 40,000 rooms. It operates hotels for brands such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Hyatt, and many more.Host shares bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 as travelers returned in large numbers. However, Host has now seen its momentum slip. With traders fearing a potential recession, HST stock has dipped to near 52-week lows today.That puts shares at just eight times forward funds from operations (P/FFO) while offering a 3.3% dividend yield.MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX)A graphic of a person's hands resting on a laptop with a stock line graph moving through it. top tech stocksSource: ShutterstockMarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) is a leading digital bond trading platform.Historically, fixed income was the last major financial market to move from physical and phone-based trading to digital solutions.This makes sense as bonds are less standardized than stocks, options, or futures. Bonds often have different clauses, covenants, and other such quirks that lead folks to want to trade them in-person rather than on a screen.That said, the pandemic and the related remote work movement forced a lot of bond trading onto digital platforms at last. This has led to a major growth opportunity for MarketAxess and its chief rival, Tradeweb Markets (NASDAQ:TW).MarketAxess grew its revenues from $436 million in 2018 to an estimated $770 million this year. As happened with many digital platforms, however, traders got way too excited, causing MKTX stock to nearly double during the peak of the work-from-home era.Now, though, MarketAxess has become oversold. Shares are down by more than half from their all-time highs even as the company continues to quickly grow and is highly profitable. Bears have overstayed their welcome, and MarketAxess could be primed for a major short squeeze.Zions Bancorporation (ZION)Golden light shining from crack of door on black safe with black background, representing bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/marozhka studioZions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) is a leading Rocky Mountains-focused regional bank based out of Salt Lake City.Not surprisingly, ZION stock got caught up in the regional banking scare earlier this year. But that panic appears to be unfounded.That’s because Zions operates as a commercial bank, providing services to small- and mid-sized businesses. In return, those business owners keep their commercial non-interest-bearing accounts at Zions branches to maintain their customer relationship.This ensures that Zions has access to a large and stable low-cost deposit base. Recent figures bore this out.As of June 30, 2023, Zions’ total deposits increased $5.1 billion, or 7%, from March 31, 2023 thanks to a rise in both customer and brokered deposits.While other regional banks have seen deposits leave their branches, Zions’ differentiated business model has stood out this year.ZION stock has bounced from a low of $18 to $35 thanks to its upbeat earnings and deposit data. However, there is plenty more room to run, as shares traded as high as $60 last year. The stock also offers a generous 4.8% dividend yield today.Sabre Corp. (SABR)Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight.Source: Olena Yakobchuk / ShutterstockSabre (NASDAQ:SABR) is one of the three primary global distribution systems for airlines, passenger railroads, hotels and other types of transportation and hospitality ticketing and reservations.These essentially serve as a marketplace platform for the travel industry. Airlines, passenger railroads, cruise lines, and so on can post their itineraries and pricing on Sabre’s GDS.Then travel agents, online booking sites, corporate travel planners and so on can view all the competitive offerings and book the one that best serves their needs. Sabre, in turn, earns a cut of that transaction.Sabre had invested heavily in its information technology platform just prior to the pandemic. This proved to be dreadful timing, as the company was left with a mountain of debt and no cash flow coming in.However, SABR stock now appears to be turning the corner. As travel has come roaring back, Sabre’s cash flow picture is improving.Meanwhile, Sabre’s now modernized IT systems should provide significant cost savings going forward. As Sabre returns to profitability, it could set off the powder keg that is Sabre’s 13% short interest.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in ZION, ALB, and U stock.

The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of -64.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.23 indicates a change of -2.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.98 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -33.8%. The $66.47 billion and $66.27 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -33.8% and -0.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with FOXA. Click here to check it out. FOXA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXANot sold to Disney by predecessor firm, Twenty First Century Fox in 2019, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) represents a diversified portfolio of assets. These include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Post the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market.With the current stock price at $30.98 and a market cap of $14.60 billion, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) is trading below its GF Value of $40.7. This suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. The following analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the company's value.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary estimation of a stock's fair value, computed considering three factors: historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line offers a snapshot of the stock's ideal fair trading value.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) is estimated to be modestly undervalued. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Therefore, as Fox is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthAn investment in a company with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Hence, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. Fox's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.52 is worse than 62.51% of 1003 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. However, GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Fox at 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. Fox has been profitable 8 over the past 10 years. It has a revenue of $14.90 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.32. Its operating margin is 18.53%, ranking better than 88.41% of 1018 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Fox's profitability at 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Fox's average annual revenue growth is 12%, ranking better than 79.73% of 957 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 11.5%, ranking better than 61.2% of 768 companies in the Media - Diversified industry.Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Fox's return on invested capital is 12.23, and its cost of capital is 5.96.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock is estimated to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is strong.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Waters’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Waters What Is Waters Worth?According to my valuation model, Waters seems to be fairly priced at around 6.5% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Waters today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $300.64, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Furthermore, Waters’s low beta implies that the stock is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will Waters generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Waters' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 25%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? WAT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WAT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

The Energy Department stressed that the priority for federal grants would be given to ""projects that are likely to retain collective bargaining agreements and/or those that have an existing high-quality, high-wage hourly production workforce.""""Under Bidenomics building a clean energy economy can and should provide a win‑win opportunity for auto companies and unionized workers,"" Biden said in a prepared statement.Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, stands with President Joe Biden during a tour of the Detroit Auto Show, Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2022, in Detroit. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The announcement, coming just weeks away from the Sept. 14 deadline for UAW and Detroit automakers to reach a new contract agreement, points to the delicate balance the administration is attempting to maintain between keeping its promise to the industry’s 150,000 unionized employees and accelerating the transition to clean energy.UAW’s president Shawn Fain has publicly called for GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA) to hike pay by 46%, return to traditional pensions, and implement a 32-hour workweek.Some Wall Street analysts estimate the wage increases alone would increase the cost of EVs by roughly $1,500 to $2,000, creating a headwind to mass adoption and putting American carmakers behind foreign automakers that operate in ""right to work"" states to avoid unionization.Story continuesEV leader Tesla (TSLA) is the only American automaker that is not represented by a union.""The UAW is certainly looking for all of the opportunities that as old school manufacturing of [internal combustion engine vehicles] closes down or shifts, that they have a seat at the table regardless of where those plants are opened,"" David Undercoffler, editor in chief at Autolist, said.United Auto Workers Union president Shawn Fain speaks to members of Local 862 during practice pickets in Louisville, Ky., Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023. (Timothy D. Easley/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)UAW’s demands point to a larger fear among auto workers about job security, as a move towards an all-electric future prompts a retooling of decades-old plants.The absence of gas engines and transmissions makes EVs much simpler to manufacture, according to Undercoffler, triggering concerns about the need for fewer workers and fewer hours.In its most recent round of layoffs, Ford attributed the cuts to a growth plan largely focused on a transition to electric, saying: ""Delivering on the plan includes adjusting staffing to match focused priorities and ambitions, while raising quality and lowering costs.""""The critical issue in that transition is going to be wages,"" said Seth Harris, a professor at Northeastern University who served as acting secretary of labor under President Barack Obama. ""Can workers earn the same quality wages in an electric vehicle battery plant that they were working?""Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois, said UAW is well positioned to push for aggressive demands, largely because of the scale of investments going into the clean energy transition, stemming from Biden's landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act.Last month, the union successfully pushed to ratify an interim agreement at a GM factory that manufactures Ultium battery cells that immediately raised wages by $3 to $4 an hour.""This is probably when their leverage is at its greatest because the domestic manufacturers really don't want to be shut down,"" Bruno said. ""There's too much federal money that's available. There's too much investment that is now pouring into the United States.""The UAW has maintained that pressure on the president as well, holding back its endorsement of Biden’s reelection, citing concerns around electric vehicle policy. And there are signs that pressure may be spreading beyond Detroit now.On Monday, a coalition of labor unions and civil rights groups launched a pressure campaign targeting Hyundai’s EV plant and suppliers, calling on the South Korean automaker to ""enshrine high-road commitments to workers and their communities in an enforceable agreement.""""I think there will be pressure on all of these companies, particularly using the leverage of the electric vehicle credits in the Inflation Reduction Act to push them to provide good quality union jobs to their workers,"" Harris said.This post was edited by Grace O'Donnell.Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned -8.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share, indicating a change of -15.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 points to a change of +0.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.22 indicates a change of -5% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $43.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.6%. The $171.23 billion and $175.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.3% and +2.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $44.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.1%. EPS of $1.91 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.34%. The EPS surprise was +10.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The UAW is determined to negotiate better terms, conditions and benefits for its members this year. The union is demanding an end to the tiered wage system that pays new hires less than veterans. Other demands include wage hikes of 46%, the restoration of cost-of-living allowances and defined-benefit pension plans for new workers and a reduction in the workweek duration.To that end, Ford presented a contract offer to the UAW last week after the union called Detroit Three automakers to come up with counter-proposals. However, that fell short of UAW’s expectations. Meanwhile, UAW has filed unfair labor charges against General Motors and Stellantis with the National Labor Relations Board. Fain said that these two companies have refused to work with the union to reach a fair contract. GM and STLA have called the claim made by Fain baseless.In the era of smart mobility, General Motors is collaborating with Google to investigate the potential integration of artificial intelligence technologies throughout the automotive company's operations.Electric vehicle behemoth Tesla TSLA made news as it cut prices of the Model S and X by 15-19% in the United States, except for the recently introduced Standard Range model. Additionally, Tesla has officially revealed the revamped Model 3, featuring a sleeker design, enhanced controls and improved comfort.Meanwhile, China-based electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc. NIO came out with second-quarter 2023 results and reported weaker-than-expected sales and profit owing to low deliveries and dismal vehicle margins.Story continuesLast Week’s Top StoriesGeneral Motors and Google Cloud forged a deep collaboration to integrate conversational AI technology into millions of GM vehicles. GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant, launched in 2022, employs Google Cloud's AI algorithms, offering drivers responses to common queries, navigation support and routing assistance. The partnership's success in implementing Google Cloud's AI within GM's OnStar service has paved the way for forthcoming generative AI deployments.In 2019, General Motors introduced its first vehicles with integrated Google technology. The integration has expanded since then, granting users easy access to Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play from their vehicle displays. This partnership also led to the integration of Google Cloud's Dialogflow conversational AI technology. Presently, GM's OnStar virtual assistant handles over a million monthly customer queries in the United States and Canada, accessible in most GM vehicles from model year 2015 and newer, and connected through OnStar.NIO incurred a loss per American Depositary Share of 51 cents in the second quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 36 cents. The reported loss was also wider than the year-ago loss of 25 cents due to lower vehicle margins and higher operating expenses. Revenues of $1.2 billion lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 billion and declined 14.8% year over year due to lower delivery volume.Gross profit came in at $12 million, tumbling 93.5% year over year. Vehicle margin in the reported quarter fell to 6.2% from 16.7% in second-quarter 2022. Gross margin was 1%, down from 13% in the year-ago quarter.NIO delivered 23,520 vehicles in the second quarter, down 6.1% year over year. As of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,892.6 million, and long-term debt was $902.5 million. For third-quarter 2023, NIO projects deliveries in the range of 55,000-57,000 vehicles, suggesting 74-80.3% surge year over year. Revenues are envisioned to be between $2,606 million and $2,692 million, indicating year-over-year improvement of 45.3-50.1%.Ford’s contract offer to the UAW included 15% guaranteed combined wage increases and lump sums and enhanced benefits over the life of the contract. For UAW-represented hourly workers, Ford decided to increase wages and lump-sum bonuses to $92,000 in the first year of the contract, up from $78,000 in 2022. Apart from an increase in wages and bonuses, workers would also receive health care coverage and other benefits worth $17,500 and $20,500, respectively. In the first year alone, full-time permanent employees at the top wage rate could make up to $98,000 from wages, bonuses, profit sharing and overtime.Ford discarded wage tiers from the contract offer to help all employees achieve industry-leading wages.However, the offer did not go down well with Shawn Fain, the president of UAW. During a live presentation on Aug 31, 2023, Fain discarded Ford's proposal, deeming it both inadequate and offensive. He said that the union will accept nothing short of consistent wages that will rise in tandem with the economy. Per Ford’s press release, the automaker will not make a deal that limits its ability to invest, grow and share profits with its employees.Tesla slashed prices for the Model S and X, making them more affordable. The Model S Long Range now starts at $74,990, a 15% drop from $88,490, offering an impressive 405-mile EPA range. The Model S Plaid, Tesla's fastest car, starts at $89,990, down 17% from $108,490. The Model X Long Range starts at $79,990, an 18.8% decrease from $98,490, potentially making it eligible for federal tax credits. The Model X Plaid, starting at $89,990 (17% off its previous price of $108,490), remains a great value pick with its remarkable 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds. These price cuts make Tesla's premium electric sedans and SUVs more attractive and competitive without compromising on performance or range.Tesla has unveiled an upgraded Model 3 with notable changes in efficiency, safety, performance, utility and style. It boasts a sleeker design, an 8"" rear touchscreen for climate and entertainment control, and a revamped steering wheel with haptic switches and physical buttons, catering to those who prefer tactile controls. Suspension and cornering have been improved, along with enhanced sound-dampening materials, including 360° acoustic glass technology.The Model 3 Project Highland offers two variants. The Rear Wheel Drive version with an estimated 513 km (319 miles) per charge marks a 24 km increase over the current model, starting at $61,900.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on United Airlines Holdings is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$5.3b ÷ (US$73b - US$26b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, United Airlines Holdings has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Airlines industry average of 8.2% it's much better. View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings roceIn the above chart we have measured United Airlines Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering United Airlines Holdings here  for free.So How Is United Airlines Holdings' ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 11% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 56% in that time. Since 11% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On United Airlines Holdings' ROCEIn the end, United Airlines Holdings has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. Yet over the last five years the stock has declined 44%, so the decline might provide an opening. For that reason, savvy investors might want to look further into this company in case it's a prime investment.If you'd like to know about the risks facing United Airlines Holdings, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.While United Airlines Holdings isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:PNC) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman William Demchak for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$153 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$122 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 9.95k shares worth US$1.4m. But insiders sold 8.63k shares worth US$1.2m. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by PNC Financial Services Group insiders. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. We can see that Independent Director Bryan Salesky paid US$51k for shares in the company. No-one sold. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$185m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The PNC Financial Services Group Insider Transactions Indicate?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about PNC Financial Services Group. That's what I like to see! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PNC Financial Services Group.

Gen Z, generally defined as those born after 1997, has become a powerful demographic with over $360 billion in purchasing power as of 2021, according to Bloomberg.""They are the ones that are setting cultural touchstones,"" Hitha Herzog, H Squared Research chief retail analyst, told Yahoo Finance. ""They are the ones that talk about and share trends and they are the one that creates a buzz and with that sort of force, and it's almost like built-in marketing. Once you get the interest of that younger generation, that is what is going to kind of create that tsunami of business.""Social media plays a large role in product discovery for younger shoppers. And once a certain item takes off, young people are inclined to buy.A recent survey from Charles Schwab of 880 Americans found that 55% of Gen Z respondents said they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. Millennials' purchases were also influenced by social media (at 46%) followed by Gen X (27%) and baby boomers (10%).Yet, young people who just started working have less disposable income to spend.A survey from GoBankingRates that polled 1,000 adults revealed that about 61% of young adults 18 to 24 have $1,000 or less in their savings, while 31% have $100 or less.So how do they have the spending power? According to Herzog, it depends.""There's a lot of factors, but a lot of this generation is probably living at home still or living in situations where they don't have a lot of overhead costs to have to pay for,"" she said. ""A lot of that disposable income is going towards buying merchandise.""Story continuesFrancesca Murray, Hannah Jensen, Jonathan Garcia, Brianna Marquez, Monica Veloz, Kimberly Solis, Christine Kong, Loreen Hwang, and Maiya Nicole attend Sephora at Kohl's VIP event at Mira Loma Kohls on Aug. 11, 2022 in Mira Loma, Calif.

CEO Tom Kingsbury told investors the addition of Sephora inside locations is a driver of the business since young people are flocking to it.""The Sephora business has been incredibly good,"" Kingsbury said, adding that locations with a Sephora made more sales. ""It's pretty remarkable. ... It's bringing in a younger, more diverse consumer as well. But it's been really a driver, and we're moving right along.""Kohl's, which has struggled in recent years, is now tasked with getting shoppers who come for Charlotte Tilbury or Rare Beauty cosmetics to shop further into the stores. Kingsbury added the retailer sees an opportunity to expand the young women's business as well as home decor and gifting.Even Forever 21, once a go-to for tweens and teens at the mall, teamed up with e-commerce giant Shein, which is known for drawing young consumers with its cheap prices.How can investors can play this?For investors with a longer horizon who want to tap into this theme, Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih shared the retail stocks she is keeping a close eye on over the next six months and beyond.Want to jump on a brand that is gaining social media hype with innovation and new products? Look into Lululemon (LULU) or Nike (NKE), Yih said.Lululemon has ""comfortable, innovative newness that they’re bringing to the consumer, and they’re marketing that to these younger consumers, specifically,"" Piper Sandler analyst Abbie Zvejnieks told Yahoo Finance on Friday. ""It’s why I think they’re positioned well for back-to-school. We’re seeing a lot of social media marketing, leveraging those TikTok influencers.""For brands that are stretching the dollar or easing wallet pressure with Gen Z, Barclays thinks off-price retailers are the way to play it, such as TJ Maxx (TJX) or Ross Stores (ROST).And if you're looking to get into companies that tap into secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness, activewear, and beauty, think about Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Lululemon, Ulta (ULTA), or Nike.Yet, according to Herzog, the push to connect with younger consumers is playing out at retailers across the board.""That is the demographic that everyone wants to get in with,"" Herzog said.

Specifically, the whitepaper found that traditional sector indexes have generally failed to provide exposure to the new consumer, people with far different attitudes than baby boomers. As a result, thematic ETFs have become popular with investors, especially younger ones. Regarding current themes investors are exploring, artificial intelligence (AI) certainly gets the most media attention. However, new consumer segments, such as sports betting, have captured the attention of younger investors as well. Global X indicates that the global online gambling industry is expected to grow significantly. In 2022, The global sports betting market was valued at $83.6 billion. By 2030, it’s expected to grow to $180 billion with a compound annual growth rate of 10.3%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo capture some of this growth, you can invest in a broad-market index to gain exposure to gambling businesses such as DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG). Or you can build a core portfolio of broad-market ETFs and tactically invest in specific thematic ETFs. If that’s you, here are three thematic ETFs to buy with long growth runways. Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)Conceptual background of artificial intelligence, humans and cyber-business on programming technology element, 3D illustration. Next trillion-dollar companies. top AI stocks billionaires buySource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.comThe Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ) has grown to $2.2 billion in net assets over its seven-year history. The fund tracks the performance of the Indxx Global Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. Companies that generate a significant portion of their revenues from robotics and AI are eligible for inclusion in the index. Other criteria for inclusion include a minimum market cap of $300 million, listed in a developed market such as the U.S. or Germany, generating an average daily volume of $2 million or more, and a free float of at least 10%.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the largest of 43 holdings with a 14.72% weighting. Nvidia is a big reason BOTZ is up more than 26% year-to-date. I’m also quite fond of its second and third-largest holdings: Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and ABB (OTCMKTS:ABBNY), with weightings of 9.69% and 8.28%, respectively. Story continuesThe top three industries by weight are industrial machinery (24.1%), semiconductors (14.7%), and medical specialties (13.6%). The weighted average market cap is $176.2 billion. BOTZ is the one if you’re looking for a thematic ETF dominated by large-cap stocks.VanEck Gaming ETF (BJK)A photo of 2 red dice rolling on a black mirrored background.Source: 7th Sun / Shutterstock.comVanEck Gaming ETF (NASDAQ:BJK) was the first U.S.-listed ETF to focus on the global gaming industry. Launched in January 2008, it tracks the performance of the MVIS Global Gaming Index. To be eligible for inclusion in the index, a company must generate at least 50% of its revenue from gambling.Unfortunately, gambling ETFs have yet to gain traction with investors, but with sports betting coming on, that may change. In addition to generating more than 50% of their revenue from gambling, the companies in the index have market capitalizations of $150 million or greater, a three-month average daily volume of over $1 million, and a minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the past six months. A nice positive: BJK’s one-year return of 19.8% is nearly double that of the S&amp;P 500. The ETF has 42 holdings, with the top five accounting for 34% of the fund’s $60 million net assets. It’s been a while since the ETF’s had a breakout quarter. Its best three-month period since inception was 34.9% in Q2 2009.Of the top five, I like VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) because it’s more a real estate play than a bet on gambling.Roundhill S&amp;P Global Luxury ETF (LUXX)Global network of map pointsSource: Blue Planet Studio/Shutterstock.comOn Aug. 23, Roundhill launched the Roundhill S&amp;P Global Luxury ETF (NYSEARCA:LUXX), an ETF that tracks the performance of the S&amp;P Global Luxury Index, a collection of 80 leading global luxury companies from Asia, Europe, and North America.  “Luxury goods have shown resilience through challenging economic conditions, and we believe the sector has long-term growth potential,” said Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments. “We are excited to offer investors efficient, low cost access to gain access to the global luxury sector with the launch of LUXX.”As Roundhill stated in its press release, the global luxury market is expected to grow between 2022 and 2030 by 50% to $600 billion annually. This isn’t the first time a luxury-themed fund has hit the markets. In August 2007, Claymore Securities (now part of BlackRock) launched the Claymore/Robb Report Global Luxury Index ETF, which tracked the index of the same name. It closed in2010.   However, as more billionaires and near-billionaires have been minted in the past decade, the luxury market has become more of a thing. The top 15 holdings are a who’s who of luxury. My favorite luxury stock, LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY), is the second-largest holding, weighted at 7.9%.LUXX has 79 holdings and charges a reasonable 0.45%. It will be interesting to see if it can gain traction with investors. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

RL appears commendable on the back of brand strength, solid demand and expansion across all channels. Also, a solid online show and strong AUR growth bode well. The company has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.These strengths have aided the first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Notably, RL reported the 12th straight earnings beat and the 10th consecutive revenue surprise in the fiscal first quarter.Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 rose 24.5% year over year from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues grew 0.4% year over year to $1,496.5 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, revenues were up 1% from the prior-year quarter.Average unit retail (AUR) increased in the double-digits in first-quarter fiscal 2024, marking the 25th straight AUR rise, driven by product mix elevation, lower freight and a favorable channel mix. The company’s strategy of product elevation, personalized and targeted promotion, disciplined inventory management and favorable channel and geographic mix, as well as ramping up of its targeting and personalization efforts, is likely to support long-term AUR growth.Consequently, management anticipates fiscal 2024 year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the low-single digits. Also, the gross margin is forecast to expand 100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR, a favorable geographic mix and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation.For the fiscal second quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. This includes approximately 100 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. The operating margin is predicted to be 9.5-10% on a reported basis and 9-9.5% in constant currency. The gross margin is expected to expand 40-60 bps, which will more than offset higher operating expenses.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research As a result, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 35.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% growth.Let’s Delve DeeperRalph Lauren is making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment. In the fiscal first quarter, the company’s digital business gained from strength in its international markets, which more than offset weakness in North America. Starting in June, the company witnessed improvements in its North America digital unit.RL reached a milestone of 53.5 million social media followers globally, which reflects a year-over-year high-single-digit increase. This was mainly driven by its popularity in Instagram, Line, TikTok, WeChat and other key platforms. RL has been witnessing online search trends, outpacing its peers globally, driven by spring icons and accessories.Region-wise, digital sales were up 8% in Europe and 11% in Asia. For fiscal 2024, management revealed plans for rich digital content and greater customer personalization. It is focused on further digital investments to continue the creation of content for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently.Ralph Lauren has been scaling and expanding its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability. The company launched its first-ever full catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app last holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform.It is on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. This plan aims at creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities. As part of the plan, it completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.Hurdles on the WayRalph Lauren has been reeling under continued product cost inflation and higher compensation.  In first-quarter fiscal 2024, adjusted operating expenses inched up 1% from the year-ago period to $830 million, driven by higher compensation, and rent and occupancy costs, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 30 bps to 56%. It expects higher marketing and ecosystem investments for the fiscal second quarter.The company has been witnessing macro inflationary challenges, particularly in North America. This led to a dismal performance in its North America segment in the fiscal first quarter. Higher promotions in the North America market and an unfavorable wholesale timing shift acted as deterrents.The segment’s revenues declined 10% from the year-ago quarter to $632 million and lagged our estimate of $635 million.Comparable store sales (comps) for North America’s retail channel fell 6% year over year, wherein the same for brick-and-mortar stores moved down 8%, while digital commerce decreased 5%. Revenues from the North America wholesale business advanced 16% year over year. For fiscal 2024, management expects a low-single-digit decline in North America.Also, unfavorable currency impacts are concerning.What Else?Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2024 sales and EPS is pegged at $6.6 billion and $9.48 each, suggesting respective growth of 2.5% and 13.7% from the year-ago reported figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPB’s fiscal 2024 earnings for the current financial year has inched up 0.7% in the past 30 days.To wrap up, Ralph Lauren is likely to continue performing well on the back of such sturdy endeavors. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4% speak volumes.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean RCL and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Gen Z, generally defined as those born after 1997, has become a powerful demographic with over $360 billion in purchasing power as of 2021, according to Bloomberg.""They are the ones that are setting cultural touchstones,"" Hitha Herzog, H Squared Research chief retail analyst, told Yahoo Finance.

And once a certain item takes off, young people are inclined to buy.A recent survey from Charles Schwab of 880 Americans found that 55% of Gen Z respondents said they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. Millennials' purchases were also influenced by social media (at 46%) followed by Gen X (27%) and baby boomers (10%).Yet, young people who just started working have less disposable income to spend.A survey from GoBankingRates that polled 1,000 adults revealed that about 61% of young adults 18 to 24 have $1,000 or less in their savings, while 31% have $100 or less.So how do they have the spending power?

Visa is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain and is working with merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei.Through live pilots with issuers and acquirers, Visa has already moved millions of USDC between its partners over the Solana and Ethereum blockchain networks to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.When consumers use Visa cards to make a purchase at any of the millions of Visa-accepting merchant locations around the world, they can experience the convenience of nearly instant payment authorizations. But what they don’t see is that the funds used for their purchase need to move between their bank (the issuer) and the merchant’s bank (the acquirer). This is where Visa’s treasury and settlement systems enable the clearing, settlement and movement of billions in transactions a day, making sure the correct amount in the preferred currency is received from the issuer and sent to the acquirer. This process happens seamlessly between nearly 15K financial institutions and across more than 25 currencies globally.""By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa’s treasury,"" said Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa. ""Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve the way we move money.""Story continuesBuilding on the Crypto.com PilotIn 2021, Visa began testing how USDC could be used inside its treasury operations which led to a pilot with Crypto.com, making Visa one of the first major payments networks to test stablecoin settlement on the issuance side. This work led to a successful pilot leveraging USDC and the Ethereum blockchain to receive payments from Crypto.com for cross-border volume on their live card program in Australia. Crypto.com now uses USDC to fulfill its settlement obligations on the Visa card in Australia and intends to roll out this capability in other markets.Before that pilot, settlement for cross-border purchases made on Crypto.com Visa cards required a days-long currency conversion process and costly international wire transfers. Now, Crypto.com can send USDC cross-border over the Ethereum blockchain directly to a Visa treasury managed Circle account which helps reduce the time and complexity of international wire transfers.""We are excited about the USDC use cases Visa and its partners are driving to create fundamental blockchain innovation,"" said Jeremy Allaire, Co-founder and CEO, Circle. ""Circle built USDC to provide a functional digital dollar that could move at the speed of the internet to facilitate secure, reliable payments. Expanding the pilot exemplifies how pairing USDC with Visa’s innovation opens up the future of payments, commerce and financial applications.""Moving from Issuers to AcquirersWhile Visa’s treasury operation continues to test receiving funds onchain from multiple issuer partners, with these new settlement options Visa can send funds onchain to acquirers like Worldpay and Nuvei to help speed up settlement times for their merchants.Worldpay and Nuvei are global acquirers serving merchants worldwide from a diverse range of sectors. This includes a growing number of merchants interacting with the blockchain and crypto economy including on-ramp providers, games, and NFT marketplaces who may prefer to receive stablecoins over traditional fiat currencies for the card payments they accept. Using Visa’s own Circle account, Visa can now manage settlement payouts in USDC to Worldpay and Nuvei who can then route these payments in USDC to their end merchants.Adding Support for the Solana Blockchain NetworkAs Visa looked to expand this capability to additional clients, there has been significant demand to leverage newer, high performance blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins with higher speed and lower costs. For these reasons, Visa chose to add support for Solana as a high performance blockchain that its partners can choose to send or receive USDC settlement payments. This makes Visa one of the first major payments companies at scale to directly utilize Solana for live settlement payments between its clients. The Solana blockchain sees 400 millisecond block times, averages 400 transactions per second (TPS) and typically surges to more than 2K TPS1 across a variety of use cases during periods of peak demand.Forging New PartnershipsWith an eye towards the future in an increasingly digital financial landscape, Visa is forging ahead with new partnerships and embracing the innovative potential of digital currencies. Visa’s work with Worldpay and Nuvei represents a significant stride in this direction.""Visa's USDC settlement capability enables Worldpay to bring more of our treasury operations in-house and allows us to offer merchants more choices for receiving funds,"" said Jim Johnson, President of Worldpay Merchant Solutions, FIS. ""Diversifying funding options and increasing flexibility is critical to serving the changing needs of global merchants in today’s rapidly evolving commerce landscape.""""Stablecoins like USDC are cutting edge payments technology that can enable online businesses around the world to accelerate their growth,"" said Philip Fayer, Chair and CEO, Nuvei. ""Optimizing cross-border transactions is only one use case where stablecoins can benefit businesses. As a leading global payments company, we are constantly focused on innovation, and we’re excited to work with Visa to bring these capabilities to our partners.""About VisaVisa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Snap-on The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.04bUS$938.5mUS$965.0mUS$995.0mUS$994.4mUS$1.00bUS$1.01bUS$1.03bUS$1.04bUS$1.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.06%Est @ 0.60%Est @ 1.06%Est @ 1.39%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$965US$813US$778US$746US$694US$649US$611US$576US$545US$516(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.9bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$20bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$9.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$17b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$271, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Snap-on as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.063. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Snap-onStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Machinery industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

It remains committed to its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. APD is realizing the benefits of the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in Saudi Arabia.The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2027) $31.8 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value. APD expects its $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas-to-syngas facility in Uzbekistan and the new LNG sale of equipment projects to boost its future earnings.Air Products is also driving productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead. It is also expected to benefit from higher pricing and volumes.The company, in its fiscal third quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.40-$11.50, indicating 11-12% growth from the prior year’s adjusted EPS. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $3.04-$3.14, suggesting a rise of 7-10% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS.Air Products also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. APD, earlier this year, increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.75 per share from $1.62 per share. This marked the 41st straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay more than $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2023.However, the slowdown in China and Europe may also affect the company’s business in these regions. The cooling China economy might impact volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment. The lack of growth in industrial output in Europe is another concern.The company also faces headwinds from unfavorable currency translation. APD saw currency headwinds in its Asia segment in the last reported quarter due to the weakening of Asian currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which reduced its sales and EBITDA for the unit by 5% in the quarter. It is likely to face continued currency headwinds in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continues  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and Consensus Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

These include Fox News, the FOX broadcast network, FS1 and FS2, Fox Business, Big Ten Network, 28 owned and operated local television stations, Tubi, and the Fox Studios lot. Post the Disney sale, Fox has acquired other related and unrelated assets including Credible Labs, a consumer fintech firm. The Murdoch family continues to control the successor firm, which represents a large-scale bet on the value of live sports and news in the U.S. market.With the current stock price at $30.98 and a market cap of $14.60 billion, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) is trading below its GF Value of $40.7. This suggests that the stock is modestly undervalued. The following analysis will provide a deeper understanding of the company's value.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary estimation of a stock's fair value, computed considering three factors: historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line offers a snapshot of the stock's ideal fair trading value.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) is estimated to be modestly undervalued. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Therefore, as Fox is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthAn investment in a company with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Hence, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. Fox's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.52 is worse than 62.51% of 1003 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. However, GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Fox at 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. Fox has been profitable 8 over the past 10 years. It has a revenue of $14.90 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.32. Its operating margin is 18.53%, ranking better than 88.41% of 1018 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Fox's profitability at 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Fox's average annual revenue growth is 12%, ranking better than 79.73% of 957 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 11.5%, ranking better than 61.2% of 768 companies in the Media - Diversified industry.Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Fox's return on invested capital is 12.23, and its cost of capital is 5.96.Unveiling Fox (FOXA)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$81.64 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney What's The Opportunity In Walt Disney?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Walt Disney’s ratio of 66.33x is above its peer average of 20.58x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Entertainment industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Walt Disney’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Walt Disney?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in DIS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe DIS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for DIS, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Walt Disney as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

158,c96f12e8-ff6c-38c9-88dd-0bb8060767bf,CL,2023-09-05,"Oil prices inch lower from 2023 highs, OPEC+ cuts in focus",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-inch-lower-2023-210407022.html,1693861447,STORY,"['SCO', 'UCO', 'CL', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- The Saudi quest to get to $90 oil came through on Tuesday when the kingdom, in an announcement synced with allies Russia, said the million-barrels-per-day cut it introduced in July will be enforced till December, with the Kremlin contributing an additional 300,000 barrels daily.The total daily reduction of 1.3 million barrels till the year-end had not been anticipated by most traders — many had expected a month-by-month announcement — and the maneuver designed to unnerve the market to the upside achieved its desired effect.London-traded Brent at $89.91 per barrel by 14:10 ET (18:10 GMT), up 81 cents, or 0.9%, on the day. It earlier hit a session peak of $91.14, its highest since August 2022. Last week Brent rose 4.8%. That was after a combined 2.3% drop over two prior weeks. Even before that, the global crude benchmark rose for seven weeks in a row, gaining a total of 18%.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude was up 98 cents, or 1.2%, to $86.53 per barrel after a 10-month peak at $88.03. That extended last week’s 7.2% gain for the U.S. crude benchmark. Prior to that, the WTI experienced a combined 4% drop over two weeks as the economy in top oil importer China sputtered. Even before that, WTI gained 20% over seven weeks.“Despite the slow start this week, momentum remains with the rally,” Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, said, remarking on the weak pricing for both Brent and WTI earlier on Tuesday before the market hype over the cuts.Oil’s race to $90 happened with less than three weeks left for summer, the season Americans like driving the most. With the fall season of lower oil usage set to begin on Sept 23, crude prices would typically retreat a little, sometimes meaningfully, in the world’s largest consuming country.But that may not happen this time, not with the Saudi obsession of ultimately getting oil to $100 a barrel or beyond. The Arabs, who control much of the world’s oil exports, have been fixated on triple digit pricing since losing that advantage in August 2022, when Brent crude hovered above $105. Prior to that, the global crude benchmark reached nearly $140 in March last year, right after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Story continuesThe question is whether demand will be supportive to sustain such pricing, a challenge the Saudis are trying to meet in a different way.As suggested earlier, with the advent of fall, or autumn, U.S. driving activity will begin to lessen and the deceleration will heighten as the weather gradually turns colder, heading into the winter months. The chill will, of course, bring its own attendant demand for heating. Even so, the period between now and late October/early November, known as the ‘shoulder season’ between end-summer and advanced fall, typically sees less demand for oil and, correspondingly, lower prices for crude.But the Saudis and Russians, and their allies in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, are planning to cut as many barrels from production and exports as necessary to defy market norms.While demand is usually the driver for the pricing of anything, in this case, the Saudis and their allies are using supply to overwhelm the buying component in the oil market to skew market balance in their way. The idea is to create such an artificially short supply that the trade simply cannot function in a normal way.Key to this is the one-million-barrels-per day in additional cuts, on top of other existing production rationing, that the Saudis have been carrying out since July. By extending this till the year-end — and widening it with Russian help — the kingdom is hoping to create a different sort of market phenomenon for pricing.“Everyone’s looking at the flat price of crude oil and saying gasoline and diesel prices will also go to the moon,” said John Kilduff, founding partner of New York-based energy hedge fund Again Capital. “But fuel uptake for this summer is still very much down to earth, higher than a year ago, yes, but still below pre-pandemic levels.”“You have an odd situation where the Saudis are trying to create a supply situation even lower than the seasonal lows in demand,” Kilduff continued. “All I’ll say is don’t test the mettle of consumers and the global economy because when either collapses, your dream of higher and higher prices will also go with that.”The four-week average of U.S. gasoline consumption — the best gauge of fuel demand — was at 9.033M barrels per day for the week ended Aug. 25 versus the year-ago level of 8.874M.But consumption is still well below pre-pandemic levels, with 9.777M barrels used daily for the comparative week to Aug 23, 2019.In China, government and private surveys offered mixed signals on manufacturing activity, as the world’s largest oil consumer struggles to shore up a post-COVID economic recovery. Those long oil are, instead, hoping that Beijing will release more stimulus measures in the coming weeks to further support growth. Focus this week is also on Chinese trade data to gauge just how well crude demand is holding up in the country.Some are looking at the start of the North Atlantic hurricane season as one factor that could be supportive for oil, especially if there are serious disruptions in production and damage to oil installations in the US Gulf Coast of Mexico. But history has been on the kinder side of late to America where hurricane damage is concerned.(Peter Nurse and Ambar Warrick contributed to this)Related ArticlesOil hits $90 on Saudi, Russia maneuver; trade awaits next demand moveGold prices flat as dollar, yields steady before more Fed cuesTurkey's Erdogan says Black Sea grain deal can be restored soon]"

This article aims to answer this question and provide a comprehensive valuation analysis of Devon Energy. Let's dive in.Introduction to Devon EnergyWarning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with STX. Click here to check it out. DVN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVNBased in Oklahoma City, Devon Energy Corp is one of the largest independent exploration and production companies in North America. The company's assets are spread throughout onshore North America, including exposure to the Delaware, STACK, Eagle Ford, Powder River Basin, and Bakken plays. Devon Energy's proved reserves totaled 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2022, and its net production was 611 thousand boe/d, with oil and natural gas liquids making up 73% of production, and natural gas accounting for the remainder.Currently, Devon Energy's stock price stands at $52.92, while its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $53.43. This suggests that the stock might be fairly valued. Let's delve deeper into the company's value by examining its financial performance and business details.Devon Energy (DVN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to this method, Devon Energy's stock appears to be fairly valued. The GF Value Line suggests that if the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and its future returns might be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, and its future returns could be higher. Given Devon Energy's current stock price of $52.92 per share, the stock seems to be fairly valued.Story continuesAs Devon Energy is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Devon Energy (DVN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A good starting point for understanding a company's financial strength is looking at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Devon Energy's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.07, which is worse than 83.55% of 1021 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Devon Energy's financial strength is ranked at 6 out of 10 by GuruFocus, indicating that its financial strength is fair.Devon Energy (DVN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Devon Energy has been profitable 5 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $17 billion and an EPS of $7.31. Devon Energy's operating margin is 37.06%, which ranks better than 79.19% of 966 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, Devon Energy's profitability is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is probably the most crucial factor in a company's valuation. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term stock performance of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Devon Energy's 3-year average annual revenue growth is 23.7%, which ranks better than 76.85% of 851 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 56.9%, which ranks better than 86.37% of 822 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.One can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Devon Energy's ROIC is 24.3 while its WACC came in at 11.3.Devon Energy (DVN)'s True Worth: A Complete Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionOverall, Devon Energy's stock appears to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks better than 86.37% of 822 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

Portfolio returns tend to suffer, as investors pull money out of the markets and wait for the pain to end. Of course, those who stick with the markets and hold through periods of uncertainty (so long as their holdings don’t go under) often outperform. That’s because the best days in the market usually follow the worst. In other words, holding one’s nose can be the best strategy for long-term returns in times of trouble.So in order for such a strategy to work, investors should own recession-resistant stocks, or at least those that can weather some economic pain. Owning companies that ultimately go under in times of stress won’t do an investor much good.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s look at three of the best stocks long-term investors want to consider right now, ones for the recession-resistant bucket.McDonald’s (MCD)Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.Source: Gargantiopa / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is set for sustained gains based on Q2 2023 results, showcasing 11.7% global comp sales growth. The company’s strategy, “Accelerating the Arches,” enhances customer experience and operational efficiency. It’s clearly been a driver of MCD’s recent growth. Notably, McDonald’s exceeded expectations this past quarter, with an overall revenue increase of 13.6% and a massive earnings per share surge of 97% in Q2. The company also raised its dividend to $1.52 per share, marking 45 years of consecutive increases. With a 2.1% dividend yield, it’s a safe bet for stability and income even in a recession.The revival of Grimace through the introduction of the “Grimace Birthday Meal” boosted sales at McDonald’s in the U.S. and Canada. Folks need to eat, and if times get tough, McDonald’s may be among the only affordable option for dining out for the average American. Considering the performance of MCD stock during previous crises, and its performance during good times (up 11% over the past 12 months and 82% in 5 years), it’s a regret-free growth investment.Story continuesDevon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) shines with robust Q2 oil production of 323,000 barrels/day and plans to hit 330,000 in Q3. Aggressive stock buybacks and debt reduction enhance shareholder value and balance sheet strength. With an 8% dividend yield, DVN stock provides a solid mix of both income and defensive growth potential, something long-term investors should like. The company presents a higher-risk, higher-reward opportunity. While DVN dropped over 13% this year, recent months saw a minor 1% decline. This shift hints at a potential bullish turnaround, supported by low valuation, trading at a multiple of 6.9-times earnings.Despite Federal Reserve uncertainty, DVN stock offers strong potential as a high-yield dividend stock within a recovering energy sector. As work patterns normalize, a return to the office en masse and a reversion toward more normalized energy usage could spur continued commodity strength as energy consumption normalizes.Microsoft (MSFT)ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft CopilotSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has consistently rewarded investors, dominating the personal computing, cloud computing, and gaming sectors. Impressively, shares of MSFT stock have tripled over the past five years and are among the best-performing mega-cap tech stocks out there. I think that’s likely to continue, given Microsoft’s dominant market position in its core markets, its strong balance sheet and cash balance, and its impressive total return profile. The robust tech giant maintains steady growth with diverse income sources. Increased liquidity suggests potential dividend growth and high capital appreciation. Thus, MSFT stock represents a relatively low-risk, high-reward stock for your portfolio, especially during recent stock dips.Despite the costs of integrating AI, Microsoft sees potential in Microsoft 365 Copilot, priced at $30 per user. This demonstrates their drive to boost AI-generated revenue. Coupled with cloud services and AI, MSFT is set for lasting growth, making it a top AI stock worth buying. Thus, for those seeking defensive growth during a potential period of turmoil, Microsoft is one of my top picks.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

165,38f794fe-4a7e-34de-80c9-138f31008c90,MU,2023-09-05,Is Micron (MU) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-mu-buy-wall-street-133006765.html,1693834206,STORY,['MU'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.57, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.57 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 70.4% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$4.56.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip our detailed analysis of food addiction and its impact on the fast food and weight loss industries, go directly and see 5 Most Addictive Foods According to Science. According to a poll conducted by the University of Michigan, one in eight Americans over 50 struggle with food addiction. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that the United States tops our list of 25 Countries With The Highest Rates of Obesity. According to the World Health Organization, obesity remains one of the most significant challenges to public health in the 21st century. A report published by pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) ascertains that the global economic impact of the obesity epidemic is likely to double by 2035 to $4.27 trillion from 2020 levels as prevalence of the condition continues to skyrocket to alarming levels.  Food Addiction and Fast Food: An In-Depth LookBut why do processed foods pose such a grave threat to public health? Despite rising obesity levels, why do people find it difficult to quit consuming unhealthy food? Here is what Dr. Ashley Gearhardt, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, had to say about the correlation between rising obesity rates and food addiction:""Evidence is growing that highly processed foods are capable of triggering addictive processes akin to addictive drugs like tobacco. In fact, addictive drugs and highly processed foods are created using very similar processes. For example, humans refine and process a naturally occurring substance (like a tobacco leaf) and process it into a product (like cigarettes) that has unnaturally high levels of a rewarding substance (like nicotine) and then add scores of additives (like ammonia and menthol) to further enhance it. These addictive drugs hijack the same reward centers of the brain that are so powerfully activated by highly processed foods. In fact, highly processed foods and addictive drugs are often consumed for the same reason—to experience a sense of pleasure and to reduce negative emotions. Whether it is a highly processed food or a drug, a substance can become so highly rewarding that it can trigger compulsive behavior (i.e., the person can’t stop even if they really want to). This is good news for industries that profit from selling these substances, but bad news for the rest of us.""Story continuesIn a June 2023 article, the Guardian traced the genesis of addictive foods. The article posited that ""ultra-processed foods"" are the source of the rampant food addiction seen across the United States today. In the 1980s, food companies started to engineer a new classification of foods called ""ultra-processed foods"" at a mass scale. These foods tend to contain exorbitant amounts of sugar, salt, fat, artificial food color, or preservatives - substances that aren't exactly food so much as ""extracted from foods"", like hydrogenated fats, bulking agents, and starches. This formula was later co-opted by massive fast food chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Domino's Pizza Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM). In 2009, Brazilian researcher Carlos Monteiro published a paper in which he concluded that ""ultra-processed foods"" are intentionally and specifically engineered to be ""edible, palatable, and habit-forming"". According to Monteiro, added usage of salt, sugar, fat, and preservatives in addictive foods by fast food conglomerates like McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) stimulate the release of dopamine. It signals to the brain that one is not eating as much as one actually is, leading to the obesity epidemic the United States struggles with today.

For the modern consumer, weight loss is to be looked at through a much more ""sophisticated lens"", incorporating not only weight loss, nutrition and fitness but also physical and mental health wellbeing. The study surveyed roughly 7500 respondents across six major markets around the world to conclude that more than 79% of consumers believe weight loss and wellness to be important, and 42% consider it to be a foremost priority.As pointed out in our article ""11 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Invest In"", consumer interest and purchasing power remains on the upsurge and is beginning to present numerous opportunities for weight loss companies. According to McKinsey, the global wellness market is worth more than $1.5 trillion, with an annual growth rate of up to 10 percent. Post the COVID-19 crisis and with conversations around food addiction making it into the mainstream, spending on personal wellness is on a strong rebound. With its flagship anti-obesity drug Wegovy, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is a major player in the weight loss market. Other prominent weight loss stocks are Medifast Inc. (NYSE:MED) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, McKinsey also points out that due to this rebound, the weight loss market is becoming increasingly competitive, creating the need for companies to be incredibly strategic about how and where they create points of competition.As the food industry continues to double down on many of the addictive ingredients that go into the products which made our list of the most addictive foods according to science, hedge funds are diverting major investments into health and pharmaceutical stocks like Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Medifast Inc. (NYSE:MED), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).Our MethodologyTo create our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science, we relied on a widescale study conducted by the University of Michigan. The survey is one of the most extensive studies ever conducted on food addiction and has more than 400 citations. The researchers studied addiction-like eating habits of more than 520 participants. Each participant was provided with a list of 35 foods, both processed and unprocessed. The respondents used the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) as a point of reference. The YFAS measures addiction-like eating of palatable foods based on the eleven primary diagnostic criteria of substance dependence in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).With the YFAS as a point of reference, each respondent was then asked to rate a variety of foods on a scale of 1 (not at all addictive) to 7 (extremely addictive). After every respondent had rated each type of food, the resultant scores of were then averaged out to create an individual score for each entry. The foods were then ranked based on the average score they obtained, from lowest to highest.In this vein, here is our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science.Most Addictive Foods According to SciencePhoto by Nathan Dumlao on UnsplashMost Addictive Foods According to Science20. EggsAverage Score: 2.18One of the most versatile foods to make and consume, eggs are a breakfast staple across the world. Due to the extensive variety in which eggs can be prepared and eaten, they make our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science.19. NutsAverage Score: 2.47Nuts contain a lot of vegetable omega 6-fatty acids. That, coupled with the unique combination of flavors and textures that many people find appealing, contribute to the ""munching"" behavior which is commonly attributed to nuts.18. MuffinsAverage Score: 2.50Muffins are quaint and colorful pieces of cake in a cup-shaped foil and are typically iced. Although they seem harmless, research has shown that the butter in the fluffy sponges and the excessive amount of sugar in the icing ensure a habitual consumption of muffins by the consumer.17. SteaksAverage Score: 2.54Steaks, which are thick cuts of meat that are usually grilled or fried, are an American culinary favorite. They are usually prepared  in domestic and professional kitchens and are often a household offering in a menu. Steaks may appear in small amounts in an hors d'oeuvre, in an entrée dish or, more usually, in a significant amount as the main course.16. Gummy CandiesAverage Score: 2.57Popularly known as ""gummies"", gummy candy are a broad category of gelatin based chewable candy. They are available in a diverse variety of shapes, flavors, and sizes and contain exorbitant amounts of sugar which make them incredibly addictive. They are one of the most widely consumed types of confectionary and their popularity among children ranks them on our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science.15. Breakfast CerealsAverage Score: 2.59Perhaps one of the most surprising entries on this list, respondents highlighted breakfast cereals to be incredibly addicting. This is probably due to the added usage of sugar and salt which are often used in processed foods to make people crave them more.14. PopcornAverage Score: 2.64Whether it be because of the addition of strong aroma chemicals or the added usage of addictive ingredients like salt and butter, developing excessive consumption patterns with respect to popcorn is an incredibly common occurrence. As popcorn becomes synonymous with movies and sleepovers, it is fast emerging as one of the most widely consumed snacks in the United States.13. RollsAverage Score: 2.73One of the few non-processed foods to make our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science, a roll is a round or oblong individual loaf of bread usually served as a meal accompaniment in American English and British traditions. They can be eaten whole, or can be cut and filled. Bread rolls are increasingly common in Eastern, Northern, and Western Europe.12. Fried ChickenAverage Score: 2.97A tradition dating back to the European Middle Ages, deep fried chicken is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with flour and deep-fried. It is one of the most popular fast foods, with Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) cementing their place as two of the biggest producers of the dish.11. BaconAverage Score: 3.03According to a study by the National Institute of Health, bacon is one of the most addictive foods primarily due to its distinctive scent, its nostalgic value, and the exorbitant amount of salt and fat it contains.10. CheeseAverage Score: 3.22Cheese is one of the most popular dairy products in the world, used cross-culturally in an incredibly diverse variety of cuisines. Surveys show that on average, Americans consume more than eleven pounds of cheese per person per year as of 2018. One of the primary reasons for this is the presence of the protein casein which can cross the blood-brain barrier and attach on dopamine receptors in the brain, causing addiction-like symptoms. Fast food companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) and Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) use large amounts of cheese in their product portfolio.9. CakesAverage Score: 3.26Due to excessive amounts of sugar, desserts like cake cause the brain to release endorphins such as serotonin. These hormones tend to make one feel happy, calm, and cheerful, replicating the same effects certain drugs have on the brain. Hence, cakes make our list of the 20 most addictive foods according to science.8. SodasAverage Score: 3.29Like cake, sodas also contain abnormally large quantities of sugar. Additionally though, according to a study by Ohio State University, carbonation also makes sodas incredibly addictive. The bubbles tend to add a minute amount of acidity, which when coupled with excessive caffeine, intensifies feelings of euphoria in the consumer.7. CheeseburgersAverage Score: 3.51A study by the University of Wisconsin posited that cheeseburgers can be just as addictive as cigarettes and on occasion, even hard drugs. Due to high quantities of fat and carbohydrates, cheeseburgers can alter brain biochemistry in the same way as certain powerful opiates such as morphine.6. French friesAverage Score: 3.60French fries are part of a select group of foods that come under the category of ""hyperpalatable foods"". Due to an excessive amount of salt, fat, and carbohydrate, French fries stimulate the reward center of the brain to induce constant craving within the consumer. Fast food giants like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) coat fries in dextrose, a form of sugar to create feelings of euphoria and happiness.

169,50531066-b64c-369e-870e-84f176546a5f,PLD,2023-09-05,Prologis (PLD) Stock Up More Than 10% YTD: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-pld-stock-more-10-150400384.html,1693839840,STORY,['PLD'],"[The favorable industrial real estate market scenario, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale, has enabled Prologis PLD to ride the growth curve so far.The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing solid demand for its facilities, as evidenced by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of its properties.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) behemoth has rallied 10.5% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 2.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us now decipher the factors behind the surge in the stock price and also check whether this trend will last.The demand for industrial real estate space is escalating, given the growth in industries and an e-commerce boom. Moreover, companies are making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, and resilience is essential to the future of supply chains. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels.Given this backdrop, Prologis’ portfolio of modern and high-quality logistics facilities continues to benefit from these favorable industrial real estate market fundamentals, driving healthy operating performance.In the second quarter of 2023, the average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio remained high at 97.5%. Further, 43.3 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 38.4 msf in the operating portfolio and 4.9 msf in the development portfolio. The retention level was 70.5% in the quarter. Cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew 10.7% in the second quarter.As a result, Prologis’ second-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.83 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.68. The company also raised its core FFO per share guidance for 2023 to the range of $5.56-$5.60 from the $5.42-$5.50 guided earlier, suggesting a 2.2% increase at the midpoint. PLD estimated cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) between 9.50% and 10%, up 37.5 basis points at the midpoint than what was guided earlier.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has been capitalizing on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. In June 2023, the company concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for a cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth.Prologis’ share of building acquisitions amounted to $172 million in the six months that ended Jun 30, 2023. Development stabilization aggregated $1.47 billion, while development starts totaled $411 million. For 2023, PLD anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, while development starts are expected in the range of $2.5-$3 billion.This industrial REIT maintains a robust balance sheet position, which has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Its liquidity amounted to $6.4 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Jun 30, 2023.In addition, the company’s credit ratings as of Jun 30, 2023 were A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s, enabling the company to borrow at an advantageous rate. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to ride the growth curve over the long term.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.43%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.However, with the asset category being attractive, even during challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. The high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long, and the growth of e-commerce sales is likely to stabilize to some extent in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, a high interest rate is a concern for Prologis. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It caters to both enterprise and consumer markets, forming a practical duopoly with its chief rival, Western Digital. Both companies are vertically integrated. The current stock price of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC is $73.7, while the GF Value, an estimate of fair value, stands at $55.6. This discrepancy suggests that the stock may be overvalued.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Closer Look at Its Overvalued StatusUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC's stock seems to be significantly overvalued, according to the GF Value calculation. At its current price of $73.7 per share and a market cap of $15.30 billion, the stock's long-term return is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Closer Look at Its Overvalued StatusLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before buying its stock. Investing in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage are great ways to understand a company's financial strength. Seagate Technology Holdings PLC has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14, ranking worse than 92.05% of 2353 companies in the Hardware industry. The overall financial strength of the company is 3 out of 10, indicating that it is weak.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Closer Look at Its Overvalued StatusProfitability and GrowthCompanies that have consistently been profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profitability usually indicates a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Seagate Technology Holdings PLC has been profitable 9 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $7.40 billion and a Loss Per Share of $2.55. Its operating margin is 0.81%, ranking worse than 64.53% of 2422 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -36%, ranking worse than 94.33% of 1941 companies in the Hardware industry.Another way to evaluate a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Seagate Technology Holdings PLC's ROIC was 1.17, while its WACC came in at 9.21.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (STX): A Closer Look at Its Overvalued StatusConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC gives every indication of being significantly overvalued.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Pentair plc is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Pentair plc imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Pentair plcFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this company is expected to earn $3.74 per share, which is a change of 1.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Pentair plc. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Pentair plc to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

177,f7f0ecbc-e7e9-39d7-bdf7-69a61afe6ad8,BSX,2023-09-05,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-boston-scientific-110026310.html,1693911626,STORY,['BSX'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Boston Scientific fair value estimate is US$47.55With US$53.62 share price, Boston Scientific appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 21% lower than Boston Scientific's analyst price target of US$59.86In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.63bUS$2.85bUS$3.18bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.66bUS$3.78bUS$3.89bUS$4.00bUS$4.10bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.80%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.2%) = US$89bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$89b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$46bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$70b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$53.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.946. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Medical Equipment industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Boston Scientific, we've compiled three important factors you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - Boston Scientific has   3 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does BSX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Textron (NYSE:TXT), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Textron, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.095 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Textron has an ROCE of 9.5%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 9.5%, it's still a low return by itself. Check out our latest analysis for Textron roceIn the above chart we have measured Textron's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Textron's ROCE Trending?Things have been pretty stable at Textron, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Textron doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.The Bottom LineIn a nutshell, Textron has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And with the stock having returned a mere 13% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesTextron could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.While Textron may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

However, pricing pressure remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 16.3% year to date against the industry’s 2.7% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 18.6% in the same time frame.Stryker, with a market capitalization of $108.03 billion, is one of the world’s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 9.9% in the next five years. SYK’s earnings yield of 3.7% compares favorably with the industry’s (1.3%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Favoring Stryker’s Growth?Stryker continues to witness strong demand for Mako and a healthy order book amid recovery in procedure-demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the platform’s unique and promising features. These developments, in turn, enable the company to sustain the momentum in robotic-treatment sales.SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, with launches in new countries. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in the second half of 2023, on the back of continued adoption, new launches and software upgrades. The second-quarter results reflected Stryker’s efforts to promote the advanced surgery platform.SYK also boasts a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.Stryker’s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics have helped it stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. The company’s portfolio includes Mako as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.On its second-quarter earnings call, Stryker stated that procedural volumes continue to recover in most countries after getting adversely affected last year due to COVID-19. Although hospital staffing pressure remains in certain regions, the company expects this problem to resolve gradually. This improvement, in turn, will likely lead to higher procedures in 2023.Story continuesPer management, Stryker’s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In second-quarter 2023, its adjusted research and development expenses were 6.4% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. According to the company, this is likely to drive new product launches.In September 2022, SYK launched a new Spine Guidance Software — Q Guidance System — for spine application. The Q Guidance system has shown promising launch uptake during the first half of 2023.Moreover, Stryker’s cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins and lessen inflationary pressure look promising. The adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses during second-quarter 2023 were 33.1% of net sales, expanding 70 basis points year over year.What’s Hurting the Stock?An unfavorable currency rate fluctuation poses a persistent threat to Stryker’s core businesses. Foreign currency had a 1.4% unfavorable impact on sales during the first half of 2023. The trend is likely to continue in the second half of 2023. The company is also facing inflationary pressure, leading to lower margins.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $10.37, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for revenues is pinned at $20.27 billion, implying a 9.9% improvement year over year.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Align Technology ALGN, HealthEquity, Inc.

181,29927b04-ac69-3f89-a343-0be7e4434ec8,DVA,2023-09-05,Abbott's (ABT) New Positive Data Favors OCT in Stent Implantation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbotts-abt-positive-data-favors-161800229.html,1693844280,STORY,"['ABT', 'ITGR', 'HQY', 'DVA']","[Abbott Laboratories ABT recently announced late-breaking data from the first-of-its-kind ILUMIEN IV OPTIMAL PCI (ILUMIEN IV) clinical study, a randomized global imaging trial. The results of ILUMIEN IV were presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the European Society of Cardiology in August and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Shares of Abbott lost 1.3% till Sep 1 following the company's announcement on Aug 27.The latest favorable late-breaking data from the ILUMIEN IV clinical study is expected to strengthen Abbott’s foothold in the global vascular space. This, in turn, will likely boost the company’s vascular business under the Medical Devices segment.Significance of the DataCurrently, coronary angiography (use of X-ray to assess blood vessels) is the standard of care for guidance when physicians implant stents to treat patients with coronary heart disease. The ILUMIEN IV clinical study found that during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), guidance with optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps physicians achieve improved stent expansion for a greater minimal stent area, unlike angiography. Per the study, OCT guidance during PCI is associated with a lower risk of stent thrombosis, a potentially fatal complication of PCI procedures.Per the study’s findings, OCT imaging is expected to provide doctors with additional high-definition images that improve visualization of vessel structure, giving actionable data that translate into patient benefits.Per an expert associated with the study, the demonstration that stent thrombosis is significantly reduced with OCT is especially important as most patients who develop stent thrombosis die or have a heart attack. OCT guidance was also shown to reduce angiographic complications and lead to better stent implantation.Abbott’s management feels that the ILUMIEN IV data illustrates the impact that OCT guidance can have when treating patients with complex coronary disease. Management also feels that in those cases, angiography alone will not be able to match the precision provided by OCT to determine a treatment plan.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global OCT market was valued at $1.2 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $2.9 billion by 2031 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like the rising prevalence of ocular diseases such as cataracts and the growing number of cardiovascular diseases are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest favorable late-breaking data is likely to be a significant stepping stone for Abbott’s business.Notable Developments in Medical Devices SegmentIn July, Abbott reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein its Medical Device segment registered double-digit organic growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. Per management, recently launched products and new indications contributed to the strong performance, including Amplatzer Amulet, Navitor, TriClip and Aveir. Abbott’s highly-productive pipeline is likely to position well for its growth in the future.The same month, Abbott received the FDA’s approval for the AVEIR dual chamber leadless pacemaker system.In May, Abbott announced that new data presented from an investigator-sponsored European trial — the MONITOR-HF trial — found managing indicated heart failure patients with Abbott's CardioMEMS HF System resulted in a significant improvement in patient-reported quality-of-life scores as early as three months after use with the remote monitoring sensor.Price PerformanceShares of Abbott have gained 0.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 0.6% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 15.1% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Abbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The industry has gained 28.5% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Construction sector’s 19.7% growth and the S&amp;P 500 index’s 12.4% growth.Vulcan’s shares jumped 23.9%, slightly below the industry but outperforming the broader sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $6.73 per share from $6.48 in the past 30 days. This implies 31.7% year-over-year growth on a 6.3% rise in revenues. This can further be substantiated from its VGM Score of B. These positive trends indicate bullish analysts’ sentiments, robust fundamentals and the expectation of outperformance in the near term.Let’s check out the factors that are pushing this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company despite price fluctuation of major inputs, energy and labor constraints and soft single-family residential construction demand, leading to a 1-4% Aggregates shipments decline and high single digit rise in freight-adjusted cash cost in the third quarter.Solid Public Construction ActivityVulcan has been witnessing strong pricing, underpinned by growing public demand (mainly transport) and operational discipline. On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August 2021. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five years, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion for roads, bridges and other major projects.Publicly-funded construction accounted for approximately 40% of its total Aggregates shipments and nearly 22% of the segment sales by volume were used in highway construction projects in 2022.On the second-quarter earnings call, the company noted that highway starts were up more than 20% and 2024 state budgets are at very healthy levels. The company expects the current strength in private non-residential construction activity and increased public funding to offset residential market woes in the remainder of 2023.Story continuesLong-Term Strategic MovesThe company remains focused on creating long-term value by compounding unit margins through four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing and Logistics Innovation — that enhance price growth as well as operating efficiencies. Higher price realizations and its four strategic initiatives should continue to increase unit profitability.Improvements in pricing, fixed cost leverage and operating efficiencies helped it achieve 28% growth in unit profitability of the Aggregates segment and a 15% improvement in adjusted EBITDA in first-quarter 2023.Although Aggregates shipments fell 1% in the second quarter of 2023, pricing momentum and solid operational execution drove a 22% improvement in cash gross profit per ton. The company remains focused on compounding improvements in unit profitability throughout the cycle through fixed cost leverage, price growth and operating efficiencies.Expansion/De-Risk BusinessSince 2014, Vulcan has completed dozens of value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country. In 2022, it acquired five aggregates facilities in Texas, four ready-mixed concrete facilities and two idle ready-mixed concrete sites in Virginia, eight aggregates, four asphalt mix and seven ready-mixed concrete operations in California and an aggregates operations serving limited markets along the Gulf Coast in Honduras for $594.6 million.Apart from buyouts, the company focuses on divestitures to de-risk its business and focus more on its Aggregates business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company sold off its concrete operations in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In third-quarter 2022, it divested excess real estate in Southern California.Industry Woes PersistThe company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and profitability. It has also been facing energy and labor constraints as well as lower residential construction demand.Owing to soft single-family residential construction demand, the company expects Aggregates shipments to be down 1-4%. Freight-adjusted cash cost is estimated to increase high single digit in 2023. Concrete same-store volumes are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit.Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks in the sector are:Boise Cascade Company BCC sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Fortunately for most companies, 72% of respondents believe their organizations have this mindset clearly defined.For the purposes of the survey, a ""leadership mindset"" was defined as the characteristics companies foster among employees to develop strong leaders who can help achieve business goals and ensure the long-term success of their company. Both C-suite executives and entry-level employees identified quality, reliability, integrity and innovation among the top characteristics of a successful company.However, there is a clear disconnect between senior executives and entry-level employees on how companies embody their leadership mindsets:Almost 90% of C-suite respondents say their executive teams embody their leadership mindset, while less than 60% of entry-level staff feel the same way.Only 68% of entry-level employees feel as though their companies support their development as strong leaders, as compared to 90% of C-suite leaders.When it comes to attracting the right leaders for their organization, 92% of C-suite leaders claim these characteristics play a role in hiring and employee evaluations, while only 75% of entry-level employees agreed that the characteristics are involved in their evaluations.Story continues""The workplace revolution is reshaping how employees develop as leaders, just as it has reinvented where they work and how they work,"" said Linda Boff, Chief Marketing Officer and Vice President, Learning and Culture and President, GE Foundation. ""In today’s rapidly changing business environment, entry-level employees value a clear vision and authentic communications from the C-suite, creating an opportunity to further inspire and empower the next generation of leaders.""Companies that effectively promote their leadership mindset stand to benefit in today’s increasingly challenging job market, with employees more likely to view their company as on the right track and more likely to promote their company to others:80% of entry-level employees in the survey say leadership training is a meaningful benefit.For employees who said they understand their company’s leadership mindset, over 95% say their company is on the right track and over 50% say their company is ahead of others.Respondents who see and hear about their company’s leadership mindset are more likely to consider themselves company ""promoters"" (56-58%) compared to those who do not (21-23%).GE will share these findings and additional insights on lean leadership and workplace culture as part of its ""The Lean Mindset: The Pursuit of Progress"" event in New York City on Wednesday, September 6.

The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Electric’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for General Electric What's The Opportunity In General Electric?Great news for investors – General Electric is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $154.61, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because General Electric’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of General Electric look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for General Electric, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although GE is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to GE, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

After all, using multiple criteria — including analyzing fundamentals, checking charts, and identifying macro trends — should increase one’s chances of success. One method that I will often use is tracking which stocks the big money is buying.As Kiplinger recently pointed out, “billionaires… have larger-than-life reputations when it comes to investing other rich people’s money,” and have “intimate connections to insiders,” along with the funds to facilitate intensive research. While billionaires do make mistakes (they’re human, after all), it’s still interesting to see which stocks the big money is buying, including:Rivian (RIVN)A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for LKQ The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.10bUS$1.17bUS$1.24bUS$1.30bUS$1.35bUS$1.39bUS$1.43bUS$1.47bUS$1.50bUS$1.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$1.0kUS$1.0kUS$993US$966US$930US$891US$851US$812US$773US$735(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.0bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$23b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$52.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LKQ as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.104. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LKQStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Retail Distributors market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 2 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For LKQ, there are three additional factors you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  LKQ is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does LKQ's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NYSE:FCX) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 3.2%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-80-freeport-110033231.html,1693911633,STORY,['FCX'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Freeport-McMoRan's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 3.2% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 50% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Freeport-McMoRan, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Freeport-McMoRan?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Freeport-McMoRan. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Freeport-McMoRan's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Freeport-McMoRan. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 5.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Freeport-McMoRanThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Freeport-McMoRan Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$286m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Freeport-McMoRan. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Freeport-McMoRan .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Gen Z, generally defined as those born after 1997, has become a powerful demographic with over $360 billion in purchasing power as of 2021, according to Bloomberg.""They are the ones that are setting cultural touchstones,"" Hitha Herzog, H Squared Research chief retail analyst, told Yahoo Finance. ""They are the ones that talk about and share trends and they are the one that creates a buzz and with that sort of force, and it's almost like built-in marketing. Once you get the interest of that younger generation, that is what is going to kind of create that tsunami of business.""Social media plays a large role in product discovery for younger shoppers. And once a certain item takes off, young people are inclined to buy.A recent survey from Charles Schwab of 880 Americans found that 55% of Gen Z respondents said they made purchases based on what they saw friends and other influencers share on social media. Millennials' purchases were also influenced by social media (at 46%) followed by Gen X (27%) and baby boomers (10%).Yet, young people who just started working have less disposable income to spend.A survey from GoBankingRates that polled 1,000 adults revealed that about 61% of young adults 18 to 24 have $1,000 or less in their savings, while 31% have $100 or less.So how do they have the spending power? According to Herzog, it depends.""There's a lot of factors, but a lot of this generation is probably living at home still or living in situations where they don't have a lot of overhead costs to have to pay for,"" she said. ""A lot of that disposable income is going towards buying merchandise.""Story continuesFrancesca Murray, Hannah Jensen, Jonathan Garcia, Brianna Marquez, Monica Veloz, Kimberly Solis, Christine Kong, Loreen Hwang, and Maiya Nicole attend Sephora at Kohl's VIP event at Mira Loma Kohls on Aug. 11, 2022 in Mira Loma, Calif.

CEO Tom Kingsbury told investors the addition of Sephora inside locations is a driver of the business since young people are flocking to it.""The Sephora business has been incredibly good,"" Kingsbury said, adding that locations with a Sephora made more sales. ""It's pretty remarkable. ... It's bringing in a younger, more diverse consumer as well. But it's been really a driver, and we're moving right along.""Kohl's, which has struggled in recent years, is now tasked with getting shoppers who come for Charlotte Tilbury or Rare Beauty cosmetics to shop further into the stores. Kingsbury added the retailer sees an opportunity to expand the young women's business as well as home decor and gifting.Even Forever 21, once a go-to for tweens and teens at the mall, teamed up with e-commerce giant Shein, which is known for drawing young consumers with its cheap prices.How can investors can play this?For investors with a longer horizon who want to tap into this theme, Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih shared the retail stocks she is keeping a close eye on over the next six months and beyond.Want to jump on a brand that is gaining social media hype with innovation and new products? Look into Lululemon (LULU) or Nike (NKE), Yih said.Lululemon has ""comfortable, innovative newness that they’re bringing to the consumer, and they’re marketing that to these younger consumers, specifically,"" Piper Sandler analyst Abbie Zvejnieks told Yahoo Finance on Friday. ""It’s why I think they’re positioned well for back-to-school. We’re seeing a lot of social media marketing, leveraging those TikTok influencers.""For brands that are stretching the dollar or easing wallet pressure with Gen Z, Barclays thinks off-price retailers are the way to play it, such as TJ Maxx (TJX) or Ross Stores (ROST).And if you're looking to get into companies that tap into secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness, activewear, and beauty, think about Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Lululemon, Ulta (ULTA), or Nike.Yet, according to Herzog, the push to connect with younger consumers is playing out at retailers across the board.""That is the demographic that everyone wants to get in with,"" Herzog said.

After posting historic results in this year’s first half, led by a 30% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index (its best performance in 40 years), all three major U.S. indices are in the red for August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq have each fallen 3% in the last month, with some analysts forecasting more declines. Of course, nobody has a crystal ball, and much will depend on the future direction of interest rates and their impacts on the U.S. economy. Despite a predicted recession at the outset of the year, it has yet to arrive.But that could change in coming months if interest rates remain elevated for an extended period or rise further. Indeed, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just warned that the central bank is prepared to take rates higher, if needed, to lower inflation back down to its 2% annualized target. Recent earnings reports from retailers showing a slowdown in consumer spending has cast an even darker cloud over stocks. Here’s a look at seven stocks to sell now.The Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockHope arrives for clothing retailer the Gap (NYSE:GPS) with new CEO Richard Dickson, who was previously an executive at toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). Dickson will have his hands full trying to turn the struggling company around, which just reported mixed financial results amid weakening consumer spending. During the second-quarter earnings call, Gap executives talked about a “weak environment” and a “choppy consumer market.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGap announced EPS of 34 cents versus the 9 cents Wall Street expected. Revenue in the quarter ended June 30 totaled $3.55 billion compared to $3.57 billion that analysts forecast. Revenue declined 8% from a year earlier. Looking ahead, Gap is forecasting net sales to decrease in the low double-digit range for the current third quarter. Pressure on Gap’s operations continues due to declining market share and a tough operating environment. Over the last five years, GPS stock has fallen 66%.Story continuesAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe recent blowout earnings of rival chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) seem to have scared investors away from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The stock of AMD fell more than 5% the day after Nvidia knocked the cover off the ball with its Q2 results. Nvidia’s dominance with the microchips and semiconductors used to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications has some analysts worrying aloud about AMD’s ability to keep up and remain competitive.Of course, AMD is doing its best to keep pace. In June, the company announced a new advanced AI microchip, called the MI300X, that it says will be a game changer. However, the new chip will not be ready to ship to customers until the very end of this year, and that’s if it remains on schedule. In the meantime, Nvidia is expected to continue racing ahead in an AI market where it retains a 70% share of chips and semiconductors. While AMD stock has gained 60% so far this year, its share price has pulled back 8% over the last month. You’ll want to consider adding it to your list of stocks to sell right now.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A photo of both the Kraft and Heinz logoSource: Eyesonmilan/Shutterstock.comThe stock of Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), the food company behind Kraft Dinner, Heinz Ketchup and Jell-O, has struggled since the organization was formed through a 2015 merger. If that’s not enough to convince you to add KHC to your stocks to sell now, consider that over the last five years, it has declined 42%, including a 17% decrease so far in 2023. Even Warren Buffett, who owns the stock, has publicly said he regrets becoming a shareholder. The company recently reported yet another quarterly earnings miss, which it blamed on higher prices and inflation-weary consumers.The most recent blow to the company came with the news that Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio has resigned after four years. Patricio joined Kraft Heinz in 2019 and was tasked with helping to reverse years of poor sales and market share losses. Patricio now says he plans to step down in early 2024. His successor, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, is the current president of Kraft Heinz’s North American business. The leadership change comes as demand eases for Kraft Heinz’s products as higher prices push consumers to cheaper generic alternatives.Restaurant Brands International (QSR)A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant representing QSR stock.Source: Savvapanf Photo / Shutterstock.comRestaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), the company behind Burger King, Popeyes, Firehouse Subs, and Tim Hortons coffee shops, has recorded lackluster gains in its share price this year. And things could get worse if consumer spending declines further in the coming months. The company continues to try and rebrand and resurrect the Burger King quick-service restaurant chain. It’s currently getting most of its growth from Tim Hortons, which operates primarily in Canada, and is akin to Dunkin’ Donuts up north.The company did report better-than-expected Q2 financial results, announcing EPS of 85 cents versus 77 cents that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue of $1.78 billion was ahead of the $1.75 billion analysts forecast. Restaurant Brands said it invested $11 million in restaurant upgrades, including renovations, during Q2 of this year. However, the latest earnings did nothing to help QSR stock, which is up only 5% year-to-date and up only 18% through five years.Nutrien (NTR)A photo of Nutrien's (NTR) website, with a magnifying glass over the logo.Source: Pavel Kapysh/ShutterStock.comNutrien (NYSE:NTR), the world’s largest producer of potash and the third largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer, continues to see its stock slump amid lower prices for fertilizer, weak foreign sales, and drought conditions in many farm areas of the U.S. and Canada. In the last 12 months, NTR stock has fallen nearly 40%, including a 15% decline this year. The situation at Nutrien appears to be getting worse, with the company recently reporting an 88% decrease in its Q2 net income.Nutrien announced Q2 net income, or profit, of $448 million, down substantially from $3.6 billion a year earlier. Revenue in the April through June period totaled $11.7 billion, down 19% from $14.5 billion during the same quarter of 2022. EPS was just 89 cents, down from $6.51 a year earlier. Worse, the company telegraphed that it expects lower prices and weak demand to continue negatively impacting sales for the rest of 2023 and into 2024. NTR is a definite in the stocks to sell category.Boeing Co. (BA)BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the cloudsSource: vaalaa / ShutterstockIt continues to be one step forward, two-steps back for Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). The aircraft manufacturer continues to wrestle with problems in its 737 Max airplanes, even as it tries to put several fatal crashes behind it. The company announced on Aug. 24 that a new manufacturing flaw in its 737 Max aircraft is likely to delay deliveries to customers worldwide, hurting both its production targets for this year and its future earnings.Specifically, the company said it found fastener holes on the aft pressure bulkhead of some 737 Max aircraft to be improperly drilled, leading to needed repairs and delays. The defect is the latest in a string of manufacturing problems that have plagued Boeing as it tries to ramp up production and meet global demand from airlines. Through the end of July, Boeing delivered 309 planes to customers worldwide, trailing the 381 delivered by archrival Airbus (EPA:AIR) during the same period.While BA stock is up 14% this year, the share price is trading 35% lower than where it was at five years ago, landing it on the stocks to sell now list.Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP)A photo of train tracks leading toward a sunset.Source: Liz Kcer/ShutterStock.comIt’s still early days for the newly merged railway Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP). While the company is the only railway that spans all of North America, with tracks covering Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, Canadian Pacific Kansas City is laboring under some onerous rules from the regulators that approved the $31 billion combination finalized in April of this year. These include a unique seven-year oversight period and the inability to layoff any workers during that time.The company has also warned that this summer’s strike at British Columbia seaports is likely to negatively impact this year’s third quarter. Canadian Pacific Kansas City has said that the dockworkers’ strike cost it $80 million a day in lost revenue. Q2 earnings, which were the first for the newly merged railway operator, were encouraging, with net income up 74% and revenues up 44% from a year earlier. However, investors appear to be in wait-and-see mode. CP stock has gained only 0.15% over the last 12 months.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

197,7bf4db9d-4809-3201-bf54-7d72e01a7729,CSCO,2023-09-05,"Has Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) Impressive Stock Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-110016506.html,1693911616,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 16% over the last three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Cisco Systems'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cisco Systems is:28% = US$13b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Cisco Systems' Earnings Growth And 28% ROETo begin with, Cisco Systems has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 9.5% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 10% net income growth seen by Cisco Systems over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Cisco Systems' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 33% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is CSCO fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Cisco Systems Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 55% (or a retention ratio of 45%) for Cisco Systems suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Cisco Systems is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Cisco Systems has some positive attributes. The company has grown its earnings moderately as previously discussed. Still, the high ROE could have been even more beneficial to investors had the company been reinvesting more of its profits. As highlighted earlier, the current reinvestment rate appears to be quite low. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.
