Older people have a much higher bar for attaining wealth than younger generations, according to a new survey — which also means fewer older people feel wealthy.Jaspreet Singh on the 75/15/10 Rule: This Is How the 1% Manage Their WealthDiscover: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesThe “Charles Schwab Modern Wealth Survey 2023,” released last month, found that the average net worth of baby boomers who feel wealthy is $692,000. That compares to $414,000 for Gen Z, $531,000 for millennials and $410,000 for Gen X.I’m a Financial Advisor Who Works With Wealthy Families: These Are the Best Ways To Transfer WealthNearly half of respondents (48%) said they feel wealthy, according to the online survey of 1,000 American adults, conducted in March. However, only 40% of boomers feel wealthy, while a similar percentage of Gen Xers (41%) feel the same. The most optimistic were younger Americans, with 57% of millennials saying they feel wealthy and 46% of Gen Z saying the same thing.In a press release accompanying the survey, Schwab said the “wealth paradox” in the U.S. is driven by the “contrast between how people define wealth for themselves compared to how they define it for others.”That paradox can be seen in the fact that survey respondents overall said you need $2.2 million to be considered wealthy in the U.S. However, those who said they already feel wealthy have an average net worth of $560,000 — roughly one-quarter of the higher target. This is partly because non-financial factors such as health and family “resonate far more when defining wealth than having large sums of money,” according to Schwab.Nearly two-thirds of respondents (62%) said being able to enjoy healthy relationships with their loved ones better describes “wealth” than having a lot of money. Seven in 10 said wealth is more about not having to stress over money than having more of it.Story continues“Americans today aren’t as worried about keeping up with the Joneses, and more importantly, they understand that they can be happier with fulfilling experiences and relationships, even if they have less money than them,” Jonathan Craig, managing director and head of Investor Services at Charles Schwab, said in a statement.Those trends are playing out in the way Schwab itself interacts with clients these days.“First, when people think about managing their finances and building wealth, it’s so much more personal than just money and investments,” Craig said. “How they invest and what they invest in reflects their unique goals and passions. Second, Americans want the ability to manage their money and investments without traditional barriers such as high minimums and fees to access financial services and help.”In many cases, Americans are more interested in achieving financial comfort than achieving monetary wealth — especially in terms of retirement.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on an unprepared retirement and the best states to retire to, you may go to the 5 Best States to Live in After Retirement.An Unprepared RetirementAlmost everyone aspires to embrace retirement, relishing a period of well-deserved peace and relaxation. Sadly, not everyone can afford to live this retirement dream. According to Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), seniors are recommended to retire anywhere between the full retirement age and the age of 70. By doing so, they can avail themselves of the maximum social security benefits, even though the fund itself is at risk of depletion by 2033. On top of the risk of depleting funds, escalating inflation, substantial depreciation in 401(k) accounts amounting to over one-third of their value, and the financial support extended to grown children has compelled retirees to persist in the workforce despite their old age.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force participation rate of people aged 75 or older is expected to rise from 8.9% in 2020 to 11.7% by 2030. By this time, all baby boomers will be 65 years of age or older, and the civilian labor force older than 65 will be an estimated 9.5%. These figures imply that not only is the share of older people in the labor force rising, but the participation rates are also increasing in number.2022 also saw hardship withdrawals increasing by 36% as compared to the previous year. Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) greatly asserts that while 401(k) loans may give access to cash, they diminish your retirement savings. You lose out on the potential for tax-deferred growth on such savings, and may even have to sell stocks or bonds at an unfavorable price.Your decision regarding where to retire also has an impact on your retirement savings. According to Insider Monkey, the worst states to retire to are Hawaii, Massachusetts, California, and New York. Not only do these states have extremely high costs of living, but other states offer a better tax climate than they do as well. California also makes it to our list of worst states to retire in for taxes, fully taxing retirement account incomes and pensions at some of the highest income tax rates in the United States.Story continuesBest States to Live in After RetirementSmart retirees know that the best states to live in after retirement are those that provide the best balance between cost of living and taxes. This balance ensures that they are able to stretch their retirement incomes the farthest they can. We crafted a list of the best states to retire in for taxes and cost of living in order to decipher the states that offer the ideal balance between the two.According to our findings, the top 10 states to retire in are Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Alabama are not only some of the cheapest states to retire in, but are also some of the most tax-friendly states in the nation.Retiring in these states will allow retirees to live cheaper, and many places within will even allow retirees to comfortably live on their social security paychecks. Nevertheless, it is important for potential retirees to start saving as early as possible in order to save enough for a comfortable retirement. One major tip recommended by Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) includes working with financial advisors. Schwab asserts that having a financial advisor allows retirees to nearly double the amount they are saving for their retirement.Without further ado, let’s move to discover the best states to live in after retirement, offering the best in taxes, living costs, popularity, and healthcare.20 Best States to Live in After RetirementPola Damonte/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to come up with the list of the best states to live in after retirement, we picked the 25 best states to live in for taxes and cost of living.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.The US economy demonstrated a noteworthy surge in growth during the second quarter, expanding at an annualized rate of 2.4%. This acceleration comes as a positive surprise, especially considering the preceding three months had seen a pace of 2%, indicating a marked improvement in economic performance. The initial estimate from the Commerce Department, released on July 27, highlighted the remarkable resilience exhibited by both consumers and companies in the face of challenging conditions, particularly the impact of high interest rates. According to Bloomberg, a key driver of this growth was the robust performance of household spending, which surpassed earlier estimates. Despite concerns and uncertainties in the market, consumers showed remarkable confidence and continued to open their wallets, contributing significantly to the overall economic expansion. In contrast to some forecasts, consumer spending increased at a more substantial pace of 1.6% during this period, building on the strong momentum observed at the beginning of the year. Another crucial factor that contributed to the encouraging economic performance was the resilience demonstrated by businesses, with their investments remaining solid. Even with the backdrop of high interest rates, companies managed to maintain their confidence and commitment to expansion, fueling economic activity and job creation.The latest data depicting a robust economic growth trajectory is likely to instill optimism and confidence among policymakers, businesses, and the general public. Amid concerns over a potential recession, this unexpected acceleration offers hope that the US economy can successfully navigate through challenging economic conditions and avoid a downturn. However, it is important to note that economic growth is subject to various factors, both domestic and global, which can influence its trajectory in the future. While the current data paints a positive picture, ongoing monitoring and prudent economic policies will remain crucial to sustain this growth momentum and ensure a stable and thriving economy in the long run.Story continuesOil prices surged to $80 per barrel, the highest since April, driven by strong US economic growth forecasts, boosting oil demand expectations. However, there are concerns about potential price corrections due to technical factors, as crude oil is trading in overbought territory. The rally was led by the US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), crossing the $80 mark, supported by speculation that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its monetary tightening cycle. The recent increase in oil prices has also been aided by supply cuts by the OPEC+ alliance, reducing the global supply glut. Nevertheless, the oil market's future trajectory remains uncertain, influenced by various factors, including geopolitical developments and global energy demand, prompting close monitoring by market participants.On July 27, on the stock market front, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a rise, and it is now on track to tie its best winning streak ever recorded since 1897. The 30-stock index added 119 points, equivalent to a 0.34% increase. The S&amp;P 500 also climbed by 0.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite showed a more substantial gain of 1.26%. According to CNBC, if the trend continues, the Dow will achieve a 14-day consecutive advance, matching its longest positive streak on record dating back to June 1897. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was established a little over a year earlier, in May 1896. The recent historic streak in the Dow can be attributed to several factors, including promising indications that the economy will avoid a recession, declining inflation data, and resilient corporate earnings. On July 27, Wall Street received further supporting evidence on all these fronts. In the second quarter, the Gross Domestic Product showed a rise of 2.4%, surpassing the economists' expectations of a 2% increase, as per the polls conducted by Dow Jones. The report also indicated that price pressures are easing, with the personal consumption expenditures price index rising 2.6% in the second quarter. This figure is lower than the economists' expectation of a 3.2% increase and is also a decline from the 4.1% rise observed in the previous quarter. These economic indicators contribute to the positive market sentiment and drive the Dow's remarkable winning streak. However, despite this rally in Dow stocks, analysts are bearish on technology firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) alongwith biotech firm Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). Check out the complete article to see details of these and other stocks.Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 10 Stocks10. Lulu's Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc.

Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) is an agricultural raw materials firm that sells urea, nitrates, and potash products. On July 26, HSBC analyst Santhosh Seshadri reiterated his position on Nutrien Ltd.

For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world’s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.”07. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is a renowned semiconductor design and manufacturing company.

This revision suggests that the analyst has reassessed the company's potential valuation and arrived at a more conservative target compared to previous estimates.

The decision to maintain the ""Hold"" rating indicates that, in the analysts' view, the stock's current performance is expected to be in line with market expectations, and they do not anticipate significant upside potential in the near term.Baron Partners Fund made the following comment about Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) is a leading global digital music service offering on-demand audio streaming through paid premium subscriptions and an ad-supported model. Shares of Spotify were down on weakness in the company’s fourth quarter gross margin guide. We still view Spotify as a long-term winner in music streaming with potential to reach more than one billion active monthly users.

In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential. Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business.One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. StoneCo Ltd. STNE, Unum Group UNM, Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. ABG and Magna International Inc. MGA boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Story continuesThe Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:StoneCo, a leading provider of financial technology and software solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 55.2% for three-five years.

10,72d91ac1-5fc9-308a-aac7-98ec413c195d,UNM,2023-07-28,5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-price-book-stocks-121400804.html,1690460040,STORY,"['MG.TO', 'GM', 'UNM', 'AMG', 'MGA']","[Price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio is essentially the ratio of stock price to book value, i.e. how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.Here’s the formula for P/B ratio:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Magna International MGA, General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Affiliated Managers Group AMG are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Aurora, Canada, Magna International is a manufacturer and supplier of complete automotive components.

11,14e548ec-6270-325f-8761-12efffd9b415,TMO,2023-07-28,Here's Why Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-thermo-fisher-scientific-120042074.html,1690545642,STORY,['TMO'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of July 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$34.0b of debt, up from US$30.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$3.13b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$30.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$36.1b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.13b as well as receivables valued at US$8.02b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$39.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Since publicly traded Thermo Fisher Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$221.6b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Thermo Fisher Scientific has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.9, which signals significant debt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. However, its interest coverage of 13.8 is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on the debt is currently quite low. Shareholders should be aware that Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was down 26% last year. If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 73% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewThermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Thermo Fisher Scientific , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$50b last week after a 11% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 23% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market movers"", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Edwards Lifesciences, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Edwards Lifesciences, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Edwards Lifesciences?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Edwards Lifesciences already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Edwards Lifesciences, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Edwards Lifesciences is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.5% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Edwards LifesciencesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$439m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

On an underlying basis, growth was 9.8%. In the United States, Edwards' TAVR sales were aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued successful launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA. This figure compares with our second quarter’s TAVR model’s projection of $960.6 million.Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT) sales totaled $47.6 million, up 71.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure on a reported basis. On an underlying basis, the upside was 69.2%. The uptick is driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth and the ongoing launch and growing adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe and the United States. This figure compares with our second quarter’s TMTT model’s projection of $43.2 million.Surgical Structural Heart sales in the quarter totaled $256.3 million, up 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s levels on a reported basis and 13.3% on an underlying basis. Growth was driven by the adoption of Edwards' premium products across all regions.  This figure compares with our second quarter’s Surgical Structural Heart model’s projection of $230.9 million.Critical Care sales totaled $234.7 million in the second quarter, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter’s levels on a reported basis and up 12.8% on an underlying basis.

The gross margin contracted 281 basis points (bps) to 77.6%.The company-provided adjusted gross margin was 77.7%, a 280 basis-point (bps) contraction year over year.

Long-term debt was $596.7 million at the end of second-quarter 2023 compared with $596.5 million at the end of first-quarter 2023.GuidanceThe company raised its guidance for full-year 2023.The company expects full-year 2023 adjusted EPS to grow in the range of $2.50-$2.60 (compared with the previous guidance of $2.48-$2.60).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at 1.50 billion.The adjusted EPS is expected in the band of 55-61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents.Our TakeEdwards Lifesciences exited the second quarter of 2023 on a bullish note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company also registered year-over-year growth on both fronts. The company’s TMTT segment was driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth as well as the ongoing launch and growing adoption of the PASCAL Precision system in Europe and the United States. Further, growth within Surgical Structural Heart was lifted by the increased adoption of Edwards’ premium products across all regions. Critical Care also registered growth in the reported quarter led by the Smart Recovery technology portfolio and strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor. The company raised its full-year 2023 guidance, which is encouraging too.However, the contraction of both margins is discouraging. The choppy market conditions due to the persistent foreign exchange impact and stiff competition within the medical device industry is a concern.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksEdwards Lifesciences currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, Elevance Health, Inc.

18,99c47cd9-a289-31dc-a83e-1de04af3b468,WMT,2023-07-28,13 Safe Stocks To Invest In,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-safe-stocks-invest-050937380.html,1690520977,STORY,"['MRK', 'HD', 'JNJ', 'KO', 'PEP', 'HSY', 'PG', 'WMT', 'AMZN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 13 safe stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

It works through its Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments. The company is based in Rahway, New Jersey.Baron Funds said the following about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

Results have been hurt by seasonal underperformance, particularly in June. Management expects consumer spending to remain muted throughout the remainder of the year.Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 10.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 8.1% decline.Q2 HighlightsTractor Supply’s earnings of $3.83 per share were up 8.5% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.91. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Net sales advanced 7.2% year over year to $4,184.7 million, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, store openings and comparable store sales growth. However, the metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,274 million.Comps improved 2.5% year over year but lagged our estimate of 5.3% growth. The company’s comparable average transaction count improved 1.8% while comparable average ticket grew 0.6%. Sturdy demand for core year-round merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, contributed to comp growth. This was partly offset by a decline in seasonal goods and big-ticket items.Costs and MarginsThe gross profit rose 9.3% year over year to $1,514.8 million but lagged our estimate of $1,542.6 million. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 69 basis points (bps) to 36.2%. The execution of everyday low-price strategy, reduced transportation costs and efficiencies from a new distribution center aided margins, partly offset by cost inflation and the unfavorable product mix.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 77 bps year over year to 22.8%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 10.9% year over year to $955.4 million and beat our estimate of $867.9 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from higher depreciation and amortization, the opening of a distribution center, and the impacts of higher medical claims.The operating income was up 6.5% year over year at $559.3 million in the second quarter but missed our estimate of $574.6 million. Meanwhile, the operating margin contracted 8 bps to 13.4%.Story continuesFinancial PositionTractor Supply ended second-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $620 million, long-term debt of $1,727.5 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $2,087.2 million.

Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Chair and CEO, Paul Reilly. Paul?Story continuesPaul Reilly: Good evening. Thank you for joining us today. Since our last earnings call, we hosted our two major advisor conferences for both the independent and employee affiliation channels and also had our Chairman's Council Recognition Trip for our top employee advisors. I'm so proud of our advisors' unwavering dedication to serving their clients and helping them to navigate these volatile and uncertain times. Our advisors have also expressed their appreciation of our commitment to managing the firm for the long-term and always striving to be a source of strength and stability for them and their clients. It's these shared values that have resulted in our success through multiple cycles since our founding and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future.Now turning to our results. Despite the challenging environment and elevated market volatility since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, we generated record net revenues and earnings for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Reviewing third quarter results, starting on Slide 4, the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.9 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding expenses related to acquisitions, adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million or $1.85 per diluted share. The increase in interest-related revenues driven by higher short-term interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year. Net revenues increased 7%, and net income available to common shareholders grew 23%.Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million, and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million, which was predominantly driven by significantly weakened macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE price index utilized in our CECL models. Notwithstanding these items, we had a solid quarter in a tough market environment. We generated strong returns with annualized returns on common equity of 14.9% and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of 19.7%. We believe this is a leading result, especially considering our strong capital base. Moving to Slide 5, the strength of our PCG business really shine driving record assets this quarter. We ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion, record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $697 billion and financial assets under management of $201 billion.With our continued focus on retaining, supporting and attracting high-quality financial advisers, PCG consistently generates strong organic growth, which was evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of $14.4 billion, representing a 5.4% annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic PCG assets. However, I'll note net new assets in our adviser count were negatively impacted by an independent contractor relationship whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter. This was a planned in mutual separation and more than 60% of the assets and advisors stayed with Raymond James. The impact of the portion that moved off the platform this quarter was $4.6 billion in assets and 60 financial advisors through our net new asset metric would have been even stronger after adjusting for this separation, which we do not believe will negatively impact our profitability.During the prior 12 months we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately $282 million dollars of trailing 12-month production and nearly $38 million dollars of client assets at their previous firms. Total clients domestic sweep and enhanced savings program balances into the quarter at $58 billion dollars up 11% from March of 2023. The enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust FDIC insurance continued to attract significant cash this quarter offsetting a decline in client sweep balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and tax payments in April. Total bank loans decreased 1% from the preceding quarter to $43 billion dollars primarily reflecting a modest decline in corporate loans as new origination demand continues to be tepid in the market.Moving to Slide 6, Private Client Group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion and pre-tax income of $411 million dollars. Year-over-year asset based revenues declined due to market decline. However PCT results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interest-related revenues and fees. The Capital Markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of $276 million dollars and a pre-tax loss of $34 million dollars. Revenues declined 28% compared to the prior year quarter mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues. The extremely challenging market environment particularly for investment banking has strained the near-term profitability of the segment's results.As we explained at Analysts and Investor Day, the segment's results were negatively impacted by amortization, share based compensation for prior years, as well as growth investments. However we are focused on managing controllable expenses as near-term revenues are depressed. The Asset Management segment generated pre-tax income of $89 million dollars on net revenues of $226 million dollars. The increase in net revenues and pre-tax income over the preceding quarter were largely a result of higher assets and fee-based accounts. The Bank segment generated net revenues of $514 million dollars and pre-tax income of $66 million dollars. Third quarter NIM for the Bank segment of 3.26% rose 85 basis points over the year-ago quarter but as expected decreased 37 basis points from the preceding quarter primarily due to higher funding costs.We continue to add diverse higher cost funding sources and shifted more of the lower cost suite funding to third-party banks. While this negatively impacted the Bank segment's NIM, Paul Shoukry will walk us through how this benefits both clients and the firm overall. Looking at the fiscal year-to-date results on Slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $8.6 billion dollars and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion dollars, up 5% and 22% respectively over the prior year's records. We aren't seeing many other firms in our industry generate records so far this year. Additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.7% for the nine-month period.Card, Client, WalletPhoto by Georgi Dyulgerov on UnsplashOn Slide 8 the strength of the PCG and Bank segments for the first nine months of the year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the Private Client Group, the successful integration of TriState Capital, and higher interest-related revenues. When compared to the record activity levels in the year-ago period weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenue despite incremental revenues from the SumRidge acquisition. And now I'll turn it over to Paul Shoukry for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results. Paul?Paul Shoukry: Thank you, Paul. Starting on Slide 10, consolidated net revenues were a record $2.91 billion dollars in the third quarter up 7% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. Being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the Private Client Group business which reached record client assets this quarter. Asset management and related administrative fees declined 4% compared to the prior year quarter and increased 5% sequentially due to the higher assets and fee-based accounts at the end of the preceding quarter along with one additional billable day in the fiscal third quarter.This quarter fee-based assets grew 5% to a new record providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter. Brokerage revenues of $461 million dollars declined 10% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was largely due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the Capital Markets segment as well as lower asset-based trail revenues in PCG. I'll discuss accountant service fees and net interest income shortly. Investment banking revenues of $151 million dollars declined 32% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. As experienced across the industry both underwriting and M&amp;A revenues continue to be challenged this quarter. We are optimistic that the environment is improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity.However there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timings of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility. So while we may not see significant improvement in the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect better results over the next six to 12 months. Moving to Slide 11, clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at $58 billion dollars up 11% over the preceding quarter and representing 5.2% of domestic PCG client assets. Advisors continue to serve their clients effectively leveraging our competitive cash offerings. The enhanced savings program attracted approximately $8.5 billion dollars in new deposits this quarter. A large portion of the total cash coming in to ESP has been new cash brought to the firm by advisors highlighting the attractiveness of this product and Raymond James being viewed as a source of strength and stability.The enhanced savings program balances exceeded $11.9 billion dollars this week continuing to grow modestly in partially offsetting the decline in sweep balances largely due to the approximately 1.3 billion dollars of quarterly fee billings in July. As I said on last quarter's call, it feels like we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning and we have certainly seen a deceleration of the activity over the past several months. However, we are not ready to declare the end of that dynamic. We will need more time with stable balances and interest rates. This quarter sweep balances with third-party banks increased $7.5 billion to $16.9 billion, giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface.These third-party balances grew faster than we expected last quarter as a strong growth of enhanced saving program balances at Raymond James Bank allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet. While this dynamic has negatively impacted the Bank segment's NIM because of the geography of the lower cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet, it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firm's funding flexibility. Looking forward, we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth. Turning to Slide 12, combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks was $708 million, up 91% over the prior year quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarter.The sequential decrease in firm-wide net interest income was partially offset by higher RJBDP fees from third-party banks. If you recall, on our last earnings call, we anticipated a 10% decline in these interest-related revenues, so we are pleased with a better-than-expected decline of just 3%, which was partly a function of higher-than-anticipated growth of enhanced saving program balances. The Bank segment's net interest margin decreased 37 basis points sequentially to 3.26% for the quarter, and the average yield of RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased 12 basis points to 3.37%. While there are many variables that will impact the actual results, we currently expect combined net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks to be around 5% lower in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal third quarter, as we expect some further contraction of the Bank segment's net interest income to be partially offset by an increase in RJBDP fees from third-party banks.As we have always said, instead of concentrating on maximizing NIM over the near-term, we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and RJBDP fees over the long-term, which we believe we are well-positioned to do. Moving to consolidated expenses on Slide 13, compensation expense was $1.85 billion, and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was 63.7%. The adjusted compensation ratio was 62.7% during the quarter, which we are very pleased with, especially given the challenging environment for capital markets. Non-compensation expenses of $570 million increased 15% sequentially. As Paul mentioned earlier, the quarter included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and a bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million.The $65 million of provisions for legal and regulatory matters was made up of several items that all hit this quarter. Some of those items were closed out and publicly disclosed, and some of the other items are still in process, and we, therefore, will not be able to provide much more detail on those in this call. Additionally, this quarter included seasonally higher conference and event-related expenses. The bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of $54 million increased 26 million over the preceding quarter, largely reflecting weaker assumptions for commercial real estate valuations in the Moody CRE price index, and in particular, the office price index, which resulted in higher allowances. I'll discuss more related to the credit quality in the Bank segment shortly.In summary, while there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory matters over the past two quarters, none of the other non-compensation expenses are coming in too much differently than we expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year. But as you all know, legal and regulatory expenses and provisions for loan losses using the CECL methodology are inherently difficult to predict. Importantly, we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients. Slide 14 shows a pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the current quarter, we generated a pre-tax margin of 16.7% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 18.1%, a strong result given the industry-wide challenges impacting capital markets and the aforementioned provisions.On slide 15, at quarter end, total assets were $78 billion, a 2% sequential decrease, largely reflecting lower client cash balances and CIP during the quarter. Liquidity and capital remain very strong. RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, well above our $1.2 billion target. The Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.4% and total capital ratio of 22% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well-capitalized. The 11.4% Tier 1 leverage ratio reflects over $1 billion of excess capital above our conservative 10% target, which would still be two times the regulatory requirement to be well-capitalized. Our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.We also have significant sources of contingent funding. We have a $750 million revolving credit facility, which was recently renewed and upsized in April, and nearly $10 billion of FHLB capacity in the Bank segment. Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. During the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of nearly $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization, and we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases, as we have discussed previously. Lastly, on Slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for our Bank segment, which includes Raymond James Bank and TriState Capital Bank.The credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid. Criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 0.94%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just 1.04%. The bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was 1.9% at the quarter end. We believe this represents an appropriate reserve, but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation, supply chain constraints, higher interest rates, and the potential recession on the corporate loan portfolio. As we have done from time to time when we believe there's an attractive risk reward, during the quarter, we proactively sold approximately $450 million of corporate loans at an average price of around 98% of par value.There continues to be a lot of attention on the commercial real estate across the industry given the challenge with property values and interest rates. So let me briefly cover our portfolio. Across the Bank segment, we have CRE and REIT loans of approximately $8.8 billion, which represents 20% of total loans. Our office portfolio is $1.4 billion, only representing approximately 3% of the Bank segment's total loans. Overall, we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate, and we underwrote office loans with what we believed were conservative criteria. But we will continue to monitor each loan closely given the industry-wide challenges. Now, I will turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?Paul Reilly: Thank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I'm pleased with our results for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a challenging environment. And while there is still near-term economic uncertainty, I believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long-term across all of our businesses. And the Private Client Group next quarter results will be favourably impacted by the 5% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts. And I'm optimistic over the long-term, we will continue delivering industry-leading growth as current and prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology and product solutions.In the Capital Markets segment, there are some signs of improvement in investment banking, and we continue to have a healthy M&amp;A pipeline and good engagement levels. But while there is reason for optimism, we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would more likely pick up over the next six to 12 months. In the fixed income space, depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities, putting pressure on our brokerage activity. We hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize, we could start to see an improvement. So while there are some near-term challenges over the long-term, we believe the capital markets business is well positioned for growth given the investments we've made over the last five years and have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share.We will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as near-term revenues continue to come under pressure. Obviously, we'll have to take more significant action if the industry had once proved to be more long-term. In the Asset Management segment, financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter up 3% compared to the preceding quarter, which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the quarter. We remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee-based accounts and the private client group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management. In addition, we expect Raymond James Investment Management to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution, and operational and marketing synergies.In the bank segment, our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand. We have seen securities-based loan payoffs decelerate and expect demand for those loans to eventually recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates. With little activity in the market, corporate loan growth has been tepid. However, we believe the yield environment has improved with ample cash sitting with third-party banks and lots of capital. We are well positioned to lend once activity picks up. In closing, we have strong prospects for future growth given our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and our ample capital and liquidity.I want to take this time to thank our advisors and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day, especially in these uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most. Thank you all for what you do.

The bottom line, however, was up 15% from the prior-year quarter.A muted investment banking (IB) performance hurt the Capital Markets segment’s results. Also, RJF recorded bank loan provision for credit losses during the quarter on the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook. Further, expenses increased during the quarter.Yet, higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand acted as tailwinds, which led to a substantial jump in net interest income (NII). The performance of the Private Client Group was robust. The acquisitions over the past years supported the company’s financials to some extent.Net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $369 million, up 23% year over year.Revenues &amp; Costs RiseNet revenues were $2.91 billion, up 7% year over year.

This raises the question: is the company's stock a potential value trap? To answer this, we delve into a comprehensive valuation analysis of the company. We invite you to read on and explore the financial intricacies of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NCLH. Click here to check it out. NCLH 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) is the world's third-largest cruise company by berths, operating over 62,000 across 30 ships. Its brands include Norwegian, Oceania, and Regent Seven Seas, offering both freestyle and luxury cruising. As of May 2022, the company had redeployed its entire fleet. With seven passenger vessels on order through 2028, Norwegian is increasing capacity faster than its peers, expanding its brand globally. Before the pandemic, Norwegian sailed to around 500 global destinations. Despite these impressive credentials, the company's stock price of $21.97 significantly deviates from its GF Value of $58.97, suggesting a potential value trap.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings: A Potential Value Trap?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that indicates a stock's intrinsic value. It considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued and likely to yield poor future returns. Conversely, if the price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock could be undervalued, promising higher future returns. For Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, the current price suggests a potential value trap.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings: A Potential Value Trap?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to assess its financial strength. Companies with poor financial health pose a higher risk of permanent loss. Key indicators like the cash-to-debt ratio can provide insights into a company's financial strength. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.05, ranking lower than 88.69% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This suggests that the company's financial strength is poor.Story continuesNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings: A Potential Value Trap?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies generally carries less risk. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has been profitable for 7 out of the past 10 years. However, its operating margin of -13.87% is worse than 78.55% of companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Furthermore, the company's average annual revenue growth of -27.2% ranks lower than 85.55% of companies in the industry. These indicators suggest that the company's profitability and growth are fair, but not exceptional.Comparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. If ROIC exceeds WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. However, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings's ROIC of -4.21 is less than its WACC of 10.3, indicating suboptimal value creation.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings: A Potential Value Trap?Potential Value TrapNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings's stock might be a value trap due to the company's poor financial health and fair profitability. The company's Altman Z-score of -0.34 suggests an increased bankruptcy risk, as scores above 2.99 usually indicate a safer financial position. Additionally, the company's 5-year revenue per share growth rate is at a negative 32%, indicating a decline in revenue.ConclusionIn conclusion, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings appears to be a potential value trap. The company's financial condition is poor, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks lower than most companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.

And industry experts say that as gasoline inventory falls, higher costs could continue creeping up.The average price in the Austin metro has jumped 22 cents per gallon in the past week, and regular unleaded gasoline currently averages $3.44 per gallon, according to motor club AAA Texas, which tracks fuel prices across the state.Prices in Austin are 24 cents per gallon higher than a month ago, and 4 cents lower than a year ago. Austin hit a record high of $4.70 per gallon in June 2022, AAA Texas said.The statewide average saw its largest weekly price jump this week since the beginning of the year, according to AAA Texas. Texas prices currently average $3.39 for a gallon of regular unleaded fuel, an 18-cent increase from a week ago and 41 cents less per gallon than a year ago.Of the major metropolitan areas surveyed in Texas, drivers in El Paso are paying the most on average at $3.84 per gallon. Drivers in San Angelo are paying the least at $3.22 per gallon.The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas is $3.71, which is 13 cents more compared with a week ago and 59 cents less than at this same time last year. U.S. gas prices are far lower today than they were last summer, when they spiked above $5 a gallon.More: Is a new Buc-ee's location opening in Mexico? Well, not exactlyWhat's driving the price increase?Gasoline inventories have decreased as demand for fuel remains strong during an active summer travel season.OPEC+, a group of 23 nations that produces roughly 40% of the world’s crude oil, began trimming oil production in November to prop up prices. Since then, prices have risen by about $7 per barrel.Last fall, the Saudi-led OPEC oil cartel and allied producers, including Russia, announced plans to cut output by almost 5 million barrels per day through July. While OPEC might not have decreased by that full amount, any reductions are now affecting the market, industry analysts said.Excessive heat has led some refineries to decrease output, which is affecting the production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Some refineries that might want to run all-out to take advantage of high profit margins might not be capable of doing so, Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN Business. “Refineries, like humans, do not like it when the heat index is 115,” he said.“Increasing crude oil prices, decreasing gasoline inventories and strong demand for fuel thanks to a busy summer travel season are forcing retail gas prices even higher,” AAA Texas spokesperson Daniel Armbruster said. “Price averages are still well below where they were last summer, however, if crude oil prices continue to increase, we will see the year-over-year price gap narrow even further.”Story continuesHow can I conserve fuel and cut costs? Tips from AAA Texas:If you use premium unleaded fuel, make sure it is required for your vehicle, not just recommended. AAA's Automotive Research Center found that vehicles with recommended premium fuel performed safely with regular unleaded gasoline.Make sure your tires are properly maintained and inflated to the correct level.Avoid ""jackrabbit"" starts and hard accelerations. These actions greatly increase fuel consumption.Slow down and drive within the speed limit. Fuel economy peaks around 50 miles per hour on most cars, then drops off as speed increases. Reducing highway speeds by 5 to 10 mph can increase fuel economy by as much as 14%.Use cruise control on the highway to help maintain a constant speed and save fuel. However, never use cruise control on slippery roads because you could lose control of the vehicle.The Associated Press contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman: Gas prices in Austin have jumped 22 cents per gallon in past week]"

We'll probably get a reaction either way.""MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei opened 1.4% lower though bank shares surged to an eight-year high on the prospect of rising interest income at lenders.""If the BOJ adjusts its yield curve control program, financial markets will likely take it as the start of a policy tightening cycle regardless of the BOJ's rationale,"" said Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Kristina Clifton.""Under such scenario, we consider dollar/yen ... can lose about two to four yen on the day.""A tweak would also cap what may prove a landmark week for central banks, with markets pricing a better-than-even chance that the Federal Reserve and ECB have made their final hikes of the cycle.Story continuesOn Thursday, the ECB raised rates by 25 basis points to a 23-year high, as expected, but President Christine Lagarde sent the euro tumbling with talk of a pause in September.""Do we have more ground to cover? At this point in time I wouldn't say so,"" Lagarde told reporters. The euro slid nearly 1% overnight and nursed losses at $1.0980 on Friday.On Wednesday, the Fed had also hiked by 25 bps and Chair Jerome Powell cheered investors when he said the central bank's staff no longer forecast a recession.Further strong U.S. data, with better-than-expected second-quarter growth figures out overnight drove up longer-end Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar.Ten-year yields rose 16 basis points and broke above 4%. They were steady at 4.006% in Asia trade.S&amp;P 500 futures tacked on 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%, helped by an after-market jump in shares of Intel which reported a surprise quarterly profit.Brent crude oil futures slipped slightly from three-month highs to $83.63 a barrel.(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)]"

This compares to earnings of $0.94 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric power provider would post earnings of $1.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of 4.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Edison International , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.96 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.01 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Edison International shares have added about 13.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Edison International?While Edison International has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Edison International: mixed.

The company had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.7% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to ConsiderDuring the second quarter, FirstEnergy started a project to minimize service interruptions by strengthening its underground electrical network. The project also involves installation of fresh underground transformers and safety equipment that will further increase the reliability of FE’s services and reduce the duration of power outages.The company’s subsidiary, American Transmission Systems, upgraded a high-voltage transmission line in Clark County, OH, during the quarter. This is expected to further strengthen the regional transmission system and improve service reliability for about 35,000 consumers in the area.Such developments are likely to have boosted FE’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter as it will ensure 24x7 power supply to its customers.Other operating and maintenance expenses and network transmission expenses are expected to have declined due to regular maintenance and upgrading of the transmission lines. This is likely to have a positive impact on the company’s quarterly results.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 46 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 13.2%.The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $3 billion, implying a 6.4% improvement year over year.Our model predicts other operating expenses to decline 8.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Our model predicts total weather-adjusted deliveries of 34,416 thousands megawatt-hour, down 11.5% from the previous quarter’s reported figure. Lower weather-related usage from the residential &amp; commercial group is likely to have reduced overall delivery volumes.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FirstEnergy this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

People familiar with the situation quoted by Reuters said that the Commission hopes to find a price differential between Office with Teams and Office without Teams that will ensure a level playing field and grant more choice to consumers.The probe comes after messaging app Slack filed a complaint with the EU executive in July 2020, arguing that ""Microsoft [...] illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity.""

This compares to earnings of $0.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -14.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility holding company would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.PG&amp;E , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $5.29 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.62%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.12 billion. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PG&amp;E shares have added about 10.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for PG&amp;E?While PG&amp;E has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PG&amp;E: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.34 on $5.96 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.21 on $24.09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.PPL (PPL), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?Joseph Hogan: Thanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our two operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions. Overall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First.In the Teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the teen segment since 2021. For Systems &amp; Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and non-system revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified pre-owned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field.We also had higher non-system scanner revenues related to our certified pre-owned again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs. For Q2, total clear aligner revenues of $832.7 million up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical three year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Vivera retainers and Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program. And Commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors.It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience. DSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible, and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner put model. Over the past two years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases typically five to 10 stage cases of aligners.For Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from 15,500 in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel.In North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially and year-over-year driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs. On a sequential basis, clear aligner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, DACH, and Turkey.For APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China team season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, and India. We plan to launch Invisalign three and three in China in Q3.We are also pleased with the additional adoption of three and three product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio. In June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly a 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation, and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices.Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total clear aligner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. TNK starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters and in the EMEA region, driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel.Last year, we introduced the Teen Case Packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, Teen Case Packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign First aligners are designed for Phase 1 treatment, typically in growing children six to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially primarily from the Americas region. Overall, clear aligner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DST touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients.Invisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents teams about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw, and Jeremy Lin.Each of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 70 young adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives.Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like [indiscernible]. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth.Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice set. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.Robert Przybysz/Shutterstock.comJohn Morici: Thanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. And unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes.For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases, and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in non-comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional Aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange.In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The three and three configuration offers our doctor customers, our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with five years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with two or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.As revenues from subscriptions, retainers, and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 '23 clear aligner revenues impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, clear aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially and $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.Q2 '23 systems and services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%.Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins, and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire.Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up 0.7 points sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight.Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs. Q2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&amp;D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs.On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points.On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, and up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022.Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up $0.07 year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $133.8 billion up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year.Of our $133.8 billion balance $314.3 million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental a multi-disciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately two days sequentially and down approximately four days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million.Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook. For Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&amp;D and go-to-market activities to drive growth.For full-year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full-year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments.Joe?Joseph Hogan: At our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 43 cents per share on revenues of $1.5 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil and gas producer’s performance in the June quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MRO’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q1 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based upstream player beat the consensus mark on higher domestic oil and gas production. MRO had reported adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. Revenues of $1.7 billion generated by the firm also came in 4.4% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Marathon Oil beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 9.8%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has been revised 14% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 67.4% drop year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 34.6% decrease from the year-ago period. Factors to ConsiderMarathon Oil is expected to have benefited from higher output during the quarter. Considering MRO’s impressive production profile from its high-margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford, Bakken, Oklahoma and Permian), our expectation for the company’s second-quarter volume is pegged at some 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), 22.1% up from the year-ago quarter’s level of 283,000 BOE/d.However, lower oil and natural gas realizations are likely to have hurt Marathon Oil’s revenues and cash flows. Going by our model, MRO’s second-quarter key U.S. E&amp;P segment realized average liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) is pegged at $72.72 per barrel — significantly down from the year-earlier level of $110.10. Additionally, our projection for the average realized natural gas prices reflects a 73.9% year-over-year drop.On a further bearish note, the increase in Marathon Oil’s costs might have dented its to-be-reported bottom line. In particular, our estimate for production cost is pegged at $197.1 million, indicating a 20.2% increase from $164 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our model also predicts the company’s total expenses to rise 4.4% year over year to $1.1 billion. The upward cost trajectory could be attributed to the ongoing inflationary environment and tight labor market.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that MRO is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Marathon Oil has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 43 cents per share each.Zacks Rank: MRO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Oil, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:MPLX LP MPLX has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank #2.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the human resources industry, head directly to 5 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past two decades, the staffing industry has seen a rapid change. Gone are the days of aggressively searching newspapers and paper-postings to find employment opportunities. With stratospheric adoption of technology, human resource processes have drastically changed. Given this metamorphosis, businesses now face an unprecedented set of opportunities and challenges. Another major post pandemic change has been the demand for greater work flexibility by employers and employees. Following this, there is a strong expectation for freelance work opportunities to increase. Over the years, freelance platforms have presented a competitive ecosystem where businesses can attract candidates better suited to their needs. Furthermore, as remote work seems to be increasing, experts expect the market for staffing solutions to grow in accordance. With firms looking to outsource more human resource related affairs, competition is only expected to grow in the staffing sector. Don't Miss: 12 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy NowAnother major development has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence in various professions. With companies such as Oracle working on developing AI to enhance innovation in business, McKinsey expects staffing companies to take a similar approach by incorporating AI in their cloud-based human resource platforms. A survey by Gartner reported that while only 17% of total staffing companies used AI in 2019, the percentage was set to increase to over 30% by the end of 2022. Although AI can be incorporated in various staffing procedures, it presents a series of challenges as well. The biggest challenge would be the funding costs for development and integration of AI in processes. Safety, security, and privacy are other concerns that are inherently built into AI exploration. Another technical issue could be integrating new features into currently used systems. Needless to say, there is a room for a lot of innovation in the industry.Story continuesIn 2021, the PGC Group reported that the staffing industry in the United States approximately grew by 28% to generate sales in excess of $186.9 billion. It was also reported that the sector had outgrown market expectations by $6 billion. In terms of market size, the US market dominates the industry. As per IBIS World, the total market for the human resources and staffing industry can potentially exceed $760 billion in 2023.  Investors looking to diversify their holdings and benefit from the growth opportunity in the human resources and staffing market can check out stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc.

(NYSE:MAN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Insperity, Inc.

(NYSE:NSP) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Earlier this year, the fund initiated a position in Insperity, a provider of outsourced human resources for small- and medium-sized businesses. We began purchasing shares in February as the stock declined significantly following disappointing earnings and guidance related to an unusual spike in employee benefit costs. Subsequent share price declines during the March stock market sell-off, primarily due to concerns about the health of the company’s core customer base, allowed us to purchase additional shares in a high-quality, growing and cash generative business at an extremely discounted valuation.Insperity operates what is called a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), whereby it serves as the co-employer for around 240,000 worksite employees (WSEs) across almost 9,000 companies. Insperity provides a wide range of human resources offerings to its clients and uses its position as a large “employer” to negotiate lower benefit pricing (including health insurance and workers’ compensation) than its clients would be able to obtain individually. This model has proven remarkably successful, with Insperity growing WSEs by 9% annually since 1999, while expanding gross profit and EBIT during the same period by 11% and 15% per annum, respectively. We believe there is a long runway for growth...” (Click here to see the full text)8. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Robert Half Inc.

The company has a premier temporary and permanent placement franchise in the field of accounting (Accountemps) and finance, while its Protiviti business has become a strong domestic and international consultancy. RHI’s reinvestment in technology, including its national database, candidate performance scoring, and proprietary AI and matching capabilities are driving share gains versus fragmented competition. The business model is asset-light and generates consistently strong returns-on-capital, industry leading margins, and free cash flow. The less cyclical Protiviti business accounts for 30% of income. Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor. Additionally, there are concerns around AI and the disruption that it could have on accounting. Our view is that the sentiment around the latter appears overdone, as demand for accountants has increased over time despite major advances in productivity tools.”7.

Upwork is a global employment marketplace that enables businesses to vet, hire, and manage talent as part of their distributed workforce. Upwork facilitates labor and demand side connectivity on a global scale by providing the infrastructure to create trust and to streamline talent sourcing, contracting, analysis and payment. Freelancers benefit from having a reputation ranking system that feeds their marketing channels, allowing them to have access to quality, flexible work and on time compensation. Businesses on the demand side benefit by having extensive access to specialized talent, enabling faster and more cost effective hiring, and by having the strategic optionality inherent in the ability to flex a portion of their workforce based on changing demand requirements.Labor markets have long had unnecessary frictional inefficiencies driven by regional talent imbalances and long-term trends of increased specialization of labor and declining labor mobility. Meanwhile, innovations in communication and global connectivity have transformed the way work gets done.

Never be left in the dust again.MetaMeta (NASDAQ:META) popped 4.4% Thursday after the company said it pocketed $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32 billion, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.Morgan Stanley was ebullient on the results, hiking Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share and writing:META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.Bernstein raved:They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.Shares closed at $311.71.AlphabetAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares jumped after the search giant surpassed second-quarter analyst expectations, saying Tuesday after the close that it earned $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6B, driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.Story continuesAnalysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search &amp; other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, saying: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.Shares jumped 5.8% on Wednesday.MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground Wednesday after reporting the company's CFO warned on the earnings call that CapEx is expected to increase over the next several quarters as the tech giant races to meet strong AI demand.“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood noted on the earnings call.For the Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to driving meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on the timing of when these stepped-up investments will pay off:Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and lost another 2% to $330.72 in the next session.BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA) numbers topped second-quarter estimates as the U.S. plane maker also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.The company posted a loss of $0.82 per share on Wednesday, but that was $0.08 narrower than expected, and revenue of $19.75B - up 18% year over year - comfortably exceeded the $18.49B consensus, per analysts polled by Investing.com. Sales were driven by higher deliveries of its 787 model, and Boeing's commercial airplanes segment registered a 41% revenue surge to $8.84B.Boeing also raised its production plans for the 737 MAX up to 38 per month from 31 by the end of the year, in a sign that the planes are in heavy demand as airlines race to address a post-pandemic surge in travel.BofA upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral on these results and raised its price target by $75 to $300, arguing that the ""worst is behind"" for the company ""in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels.""The analyst added:We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analyst said in a note.Boeing soared 8.7% to $232.80 Wednesday and was recently adding more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.McDonald'sMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) shares rose 1.2% to $295.19 Thursday after the fast food behemoth beat on the top and bottom line in the second quarter on strong same-store sales.EPS surged 97% to $3.15, said the company, trouncing the $2.78 average analyst estimate. Revenues rose 14% in constant currencies to $6.5B, edging out the $6.29B consensus.The company reported that global comparable sales rose 11.7% for the quarter, far better than Wall Street's call for an 8.88% increase. U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3%.U.S. sales were boosted by strategic menu price increases and positive guest counts, the company said.""Our second quarter results reflect consistently strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski was quoted as saying in the accompanying press release.

For a quick overview of the top 10 cities, read our article 10 Best Places to Live While Working Remotely.The past decade has seen a significant shift in the professional landscape as technology has allowed us to break free from the limits of traditional offices. This remote working revolution, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has led many to rethink not only how they work, but also where they live.During the height of the pandemic, about 71% of the American workforce was working from home. A 2020 Upwork survey forecasted that by 2025, 22% of the American workforce would be remote, an increase of 87% from the pre-pandemic period.This trend towards remote work is a global phenomenon. Research indicates that almost half of all employed EU citizens would like to work from home after the pandemic, a significant increase from pre-pandemic.Remote workers are also actively seeking improved quality of life through their choice of location. Digital nomads —those who choose to embrace a location-independent, technology-enabled lifestyle that allows them to travel and work remotely —  increased from 10.2 million in 2021 to 11.1 million in 2022 in the US alone.With the prospect of remote work becoming the norm, the possibilities for choosing where to live are expanding exponentially. Whether it's the allure of a vibrant city, the tranquility of a seaside town, or the charm of a rustic village, the ideal location varies widely from person to person.Factors like high-speed internet, low cost of living, high quality of life, and improved walkability are some of the major considerations for remote workers when choosing a place to live.What are the Best Places to Work Remotely in the World?The digital nomad's map stretches far and wide, reaching corners of the globe from the historic lanes of Lisbon, Portugal, to the innovative cityscape of Tallinn, Estonia. These locations attract remote workers with their blend of rich cultural experiences, robust digital infrastructure, and welcoming visa policies for remote workers. Even Indonesia's idyllic island, Bali, with its low cost of living and breathtaking landscapes, has emerged as a hotbed for remote work, offering a well-established digital nomad community and a myriad of co-working spaces.Story continuesHowever, the canvas of remote work is not just painted with bustling cities and tropical paradises.

My name is Melissa, and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)I will now hand you over to your host, Paul Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Thank you.Paul Andrew JohnsonGood morning, and welcome Xcel Energy's 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and financial officers. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer your questions if needed. This morning, we will review our 2023 second quarter results and highlights and share recent business developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website.As a reminder, some of the comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. Today, we will discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release.And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob Frenzel.Story continuesRobert C. FrenzelThanks, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Let's start with our results. We faced some headwinds from weather and other items in the second quarter, recording earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. We've got tangible plans in place for the second half of the year to overcome the inflationary pressures as well as the impact of the lower-than-expected ROE in the Minnesota electric rate case and allow us to deliver on our 2023 guidance. But our strategic priorities are unchanged. Leading the clean energy transition, enhancing our customers' experience and keeping our customers' bills low. And we've delivered on this strategic vision across our 8 states for the past decade.We invest in clean energy resources that provide both financial cost savings to our customers while transitioning to a lower carbon economy. We invest in network infrastructure to foster economic development for new businesses to provide top quartile reliability and to provide resiliency in the face of more volatile and unpredictable weather. We're also building infrastructure to accelerate clean transportation for all of our customers and exploring innovative technologies like batteries and clean fuels to enable the policy objectives and the customer desires for a lower carbon economy, and we focused on continuous improvement to operate efficiently with a lower expense burden to our customers. And as a result, we've been able to keep our operating expenses nearly flat for over the past -- for over a decade.Our customers benefit from these actions, including significant carbon reductions and residential bills that are 20% below the national average. As you can see, we have a long history of delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders and are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance again in 2023. This quarter, we made progress on our clean energy transition plans with a growing portfolio of both company-owned resources and power purchase agreements. In our NSP solicitation, we recommended an incremental 250 megawatts of self-build solar generation in a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement. This brings our total company-owned solar projects at Sherco to over 700 megawatts which will utilize the transmission rights for the first of the 3 retiring coal units there.In the SPS RFP, we recommended a portfolio of 418 megawatts and self-build solar projects and a 230-megawatt power purchase agreement. We're also proposing a battery storage project to one of the new self-build solar facilities. In addition, later in the quarter, we expect to file our recommended Colorado portfolio for nearly 4,000 megawatts of potential resources. And based on our interim analysis, the outcomes should be very beneficial to our customers. Across our 8-state footprint, we enjoy a geographic advantage for wind and solar resources, which enables higher capacity factors. And as a result, Xcel Energy can deliver new renewables at low and competitive prices due to a combination of high capacity factors, IRA tax benefits and the ability to reuse transmission from retiring plants, all of which provides significant benefits to our customers. enables a faster transition to a clean energy economy. Each of these RFPs would represent incremental opportunities as compared to our base capital forecast. We anticipate commission decisions on these proceedings in the second half of 2023 for Minnesota and Colorado, and in the first half of 2024 for SPS.In May, Breakthrough Energy Ventures announced a $20 million grant to support our 2 10-megawatt pilot projects for Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology. In July, the Minnesota Commission unanimously approved the Form Energy pilot to be installed at our Sherco site alongside our new solar projects. We plan on filing for our second form energy pilot later in the quarter and are evaluating sites that could be supportive of this exciting new clean energy technology. We're also working with the Department of Energy and additional funding opportunities to further reduce the cost of these projects for our customers. In May, we filed our second transportation electrification plan in Colorado, the proposed plan, which covers the 2024 to 2026 period includes expanded solutions and rebates to support new public charging stations and charging at homes, businesses, multifamily buildings and community locations. It also proposes programs supporting electric school buses, innovation and income qualified customers. Our focus is to bring clean transportation to all customers and communities and to expeditiously assist in the build-out of quarter charging to reduce range anxiety of EZ purchasers.Next month, we plan to file our Clean Heat plant in Colorado and will follow with our natural gas innovation plan for Minnesota during the fourth quarter. These plans will be similar to our electric resource plans and provide a framework for our natural gas system to achieve our carbon reduction goals while meeting the reliability and affordability needs of our customers. Taken as a whole, these innovative projects and partnerships in electricity and clean transportation and home heating are essential for Xcel Energy to meet our sustainability goals and to continue to deliver our customers the safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy that they expect now and long into the future.In June, the Boulder County Sheriff office announced the findings of its investigation into the cause of the Marshall Fire in December of 2021. Our thoughts continue to be with the families and the communities impacted by this devastating fire, including our own employees whose homes and families were directly affected. The report states that the first Marshall Fire started as a result of an ignition on a property affiliated with an entity called the 12 tribes and that this ignition had nothing to do with Xcel Energy's power lines. The Sheriff's report also discusses a second ignition that started more than an hour after the first fire at a different location, which the report estimates is approximately 80 to 110 feet away from our power lines.Sheriff's report says that the most probable cause of the second ignition was PSCo's power lines, and we strongly disagree with that conclusion. Because of the pending litigation has been filed, we're not in a position to discuss the Marshall fire in more detail at this time, but we will vigorously defend ourselves and look forward to presenting our position in court. Importantly, additional information about the lawsuits and some of the relevant legal standards is included in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing, and I would direct you there.Finally, we recently released our comprehensive sustainability report. The report focuses on 4 core ESG pillars: Reach Net Zero responsibly; strengthen our communities; operate with integrity and to value people. It details our progress in achieving our industry-leading ESG goals as well as our priorities moving forward. Some of the key highlights include Xcel Energy has reduced our carbon emissions by 53% since 2005. And more than half of the electricity we provide to our customers comes from carbon-free resources as compared to 41% nationwide. We outperformed the industry reliability standard restoring power to 94% of customers within 24 hours during major storm events. In this past year, in addition to contributing over $10 million to local organizations through the Xcel Energy Foundation, our employees contributed $3 million and volunteered over 74,000 hours for nonprofit and community improvement projects.We're proud of our track record. It's keeping with our corporate strategy, and it's based on our values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Brian J. Van AbelThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. We had earnings of $0.52 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.60 per share in 2022. Please note that the line-by-line income statement comparisons are more complicated this quarter as a result of true-ups for the midsole rate case this year in the Texas rate case last year. Most significant earnings drivers for the quarter included the following: Lower depreciation and amortization expense increased earnings by $0.10 per share, largely due to the reversal of deferrals in the Texas rate case last year and the extension of depreciation lives from the Minnesota rate case. These decreases are partially offset by our capital investment program. Lower taxes other than income taxes increased earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting property tax deferrals in Minnesota and Colorado. In addition, other items combined to increase earnings by $0.04 per share.Offsetting these positive drivers Lower electric revenues less fuel decreased earnings by $0.23 per share, reflecting unfavorable weather, the impact of the Minnesota rate case and recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case last year. Higher O&amp;M expense decreased earnings by $0.02 per share and higher interest expense decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.Turning to sales. Year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 0.6%. We continue to expect annual electric sales growth of approximately 1% in 2023, which is driven by growth in C&amp;I sales, partially offset by projected declines in residential sales.Now shifting to the expenses. O&amp;M expenses increased $14 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the timing of generation outages, higher bad debt expense, insurance costs and inflation, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred costs from the Texas electric rate case in 2022. Given these drivers as well as the Minnesota rate case decision, we are taking actions to mitigate O&amp;M, which will include evaluating discretionary programs, staffing levels, consulting, employee expenses, variable compensation and other management actions. As a result, we now expect O&amp;M expenses to decline 3% for the year. During the second quarter, we also made progress on several regulatory proceedings. Starting with our completed proceedings. In June, Minnesota Commission approved a 3-year electric rate increase of $311 million based on an ROE of 9.25%, an equity ratio of 52.5% in a forward test year. We plan to file for reconsideration of the decision as we felt the ROE was not consistent with the ALJ recommendation or recent commission decisions in other Minnesota proceedings.In our South Dakota electric rate case, the commission approved a settlement for approximately $14 million revenue increase. In our pending Colorado Electric rate case, we reached a partial settlement that reflects a $95 million rate increase based on an ROE of 9.3%, an equity ratio of 55.7% (technical difficulty). We expect the commission decision later this summer with rates going into effect in September.In our New Mexico electric rate case, we reached a contested settlement that reflects a rate increase of $33 million based on an ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 54.7% in the forecast test year. We expect the decision and implementation of final rates by October. Both the Colorado and New Mexico settlements reflect significant.(technical difficulty)Question and Answer SessionBrian J. Van Abelthe Minnesota commission will take it up and look at the heart of our reconfiguration filing. And they have 60 days once that -- they have 60 days to decide. So that's the process.Unidentified AnalystGot it. Okay. So that should be coming out shortly and then 60 days after a decision whether they take it up or not.Brian J. Van AbelYes. That's up to the Minnesota Commission.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And then just you've mentioned the transferability guidance was in line with your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion within the industry, investors and credit agencies on the implications to CFO. I know you're very knowledgeable on this topic in general. So just get your thoughts there, how you're seeing this play out and implications for your credit metrics?Brian J. Van AbelYes. So I mean we've spent a lot of -- I would call it an industry collaboration on how we work this through our financials. And so not only worked with a lot of our peer utilities who've also worked with the big 4 accounting firms. And so every renews going to be in accordance with GAAP, it's going to -- we'll take the income tax approach. It's going to flow through our income tax expense line. That will also flow through cash from operations. And so I think it's pretty straightforward. And I know there's been a lot of discussion whether it will show up in the FFO to debt metrics. So I feel pretty good about it because it absolutely will reflect economics of our underlying financials. And it is -- for us, right, it will be a reoccurring cash flow benefit as we look to monetize these tax credits. So I'm -- I feel pretty good about how it will be reflected across the ratings, and we've spent time with each of those talking them through that. And like I said, also worked closely with the big 4 accounting firms and generally (inaudible) industry will take.Unidentified AnalystThat's very helpful. And then maybe just to the extent you're willing to comment on this, just a little bit more pointed question on 2023 guidance. Obviously, you mentioned the history of meeting and exceeding expectations. Just with the unfavorable weather and the regulatory decision, where are you tracking and with your sort of cost efforts in place, what are you targeting? Or where are you tracking within that guidance range?Brian J. Van AbelYes. So sitting here today, 6 months of the year, right, we're tracking to midpoint of the guidance. And I'll give you a little bit more color, right? I think about it in kind of 3 buckets. First is execution of our -- on our O&amp;M plans, which I talked about earlier. Second is we build additional rate case revenue that will come in the door in the second half of the year, particularly with the Colorado rate case in light the New Mexico rate case in flight and then there's still continued to benefit from Wisconsin last year. And then we do have expected continued sales growth in our service territories. And so those are really the 3 buckets that I think about it in targeting midpoint of guidance. And obviously, as we normally do in Q3, we will look at where we are in Q3, investing to tighten guidance.OperatorOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin- Smith of Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithI wanted to focus on the wildfire dynamics. Obviously, a lot of section on this, perhaps principally coming from out of state as well. Can you elaborate a little bit? I know in the prepared remarks, you said you referred us to the 10-Q immediately here, but can you elaborate at least on your insurance levels today, your insurance programs across the states as well as how do you frame the risk here for the lawsuits that have been filed? I imagine that some of the commentary you alluded to in the Q here, but can you help frame up your understanding as well as maybe some of the differences critically from some of the out-of-state considerations that are drawn with new scrutiny?Robert C. FrenzelJulien, it's Bob, and thanks for the question. And here's what I can say about Marshall right now. The Boulder County share report concluded that the Marshall Fire first ignited on the property of the 12 tribes and that this ignition was unrelated to our equipment. With respect to the cause of a second ignition which began an hour after the first, we strongly disagree with the conclusion of the share support, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in court. The sheriff's report concluded that there were no design or installation or maintenance defects or deficiencies in public services, electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition.And so regarding the litigation, there's a hearing in September where we expect to learn more about the procedural next steps, additional information on the lawsuit and the legal standards are included in our disclosures in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. Given the lawsuits, I don't think we're going to comment any further beyond those particular disclosures. I think we're going to stick to our disclosure statements.Brian J. Van AbelYes. And Julien, the insurance coverage is included in our disclosure is approximately $500 million.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. All right. Understood. And then any further commentary about the differences in context across different states, especially whether it pertains to legal recovery constructs and/or jury constructs. .Robert C. FrenzelYes, it's all included in disclosures an entire page of disclosures in the earnings release in the queue.OperatorOur next question comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellJust virtual hopefully 2 quick questions, 1 on Julien -- following up on Julien with the Marshall fire. Is there a timing when that resolves itself? Or you just have to let it play to the courts and you can't give any real feel of when that proceeding will wrap up and that overhang lifted?Robert C. FrenzelAs I mentioned, look, we have a September hearing where we're going to learn a lot more about the procedural schedule, and we'll know more of that.Paul Andrew JohnsonYes. And Anthony, we really can't go beyond what we've already said in the disclosure. So we have to limit the questions on that.Anthony Christopher CrowdellOkay. Great. And then on Slide 11, the pending settlement in Colorado. Just -- you talked about, I think, an alternative rate increase $47 million, but that's dependent upon, I guess, coal plant deferrals. I'm just curious if you could talk about how the commission will they hopefully, when they approve the settlement, is that when they will address how they handle the coal plant deferrals? Or does that get rolled into a separate proceeding?Robert C. FrenzelNo. Anthony, that will all be decided within the rate case decision that the commission will make here in Q3. So they deliver -- they had hearings on it in July, and so it's all part of the record. So it's kind of either the $95 million one or the alternative if you defer some additional depreciation is $47 million. And that $48 million difference is just the deferral of depreciation. So all will be decided.Brian J. Van AbelSo it would be earnings neutral, but it would have a cash flow impact, obviously.OperatorOur next question comes from Sophie Karp of KeyBanc.Sophie Ksenia KarpA lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I can just ask a couple of questions here. So on volumes, I'm just curious if you could discuss a little bit what drive the volume variability here like aside from weather -- it seems like C&amp;I volumes were equally or closed equally weak as well as residential. So what are some puts and takes that drive it, I guess, year-over-year?Brian J. Van AbelSophie, yes, if I think about sales and really looking at the weather normalized sales, we continue to see really strong growth on the C&amp;I side out of SPS and in Q2 on a weather normalized basis. We had strength in Minnesota and Wisconsin to Colorado on a year-to-date basis on C&amp;I. There is a large manufacturing facility was down for the first quarter in the first quarter of this year in Colorado. So that had some weakness on the residential side, the residential while we're down close to 1% for the year. It's tracking in line with our forecast or expectations for the year, right? We continue to see good customer growth, but we do see continued use for customer declines as our -- we have really strong energy efficiency and DSM program. So I think overall, it is tracking both on the C&amp;I side and on the resi side, is tracking to expectations for kind of through the first 6 months and for the balance of the year with our guidance on sales.Sophie Ksenia KarpAll right. And maybe I can just ask the bigger picture question here. I know you've been looking at potentially involvement in operating into 1 of your territories? Just kind of curious how you're still thinking about that and if it's been a new progress to report.Robert C. FrenzelIt's Bob. We look, we -- as a company, we certainly have a view on nuclear, both current and future. Key priority for us is preserving the existing nuclear fleet and making sure that -- there's a potential for a nuclear future for the country. We have been working with a company called NuScale on their technology. It's an SMR technology mostly helping them through the nuclear regulatory process and making sure that their applications meet the NRC guidelines and hoping to get that, that technology can get through the regulatory process. We don't have plans as a company to own or operate a SMR at this point. We really are just taking our nuclear expertise and helping with the nuclear future for that company with -- so we don't have any specific plans to announce on SMRs in specifics.OperatorNext question from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportBob, you've been vocal about sort of an all of the above approach kind of on the energy transition from a technology perspective. And you talked a little bit about the grant to support the Form Energy pilot. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of how that pilot is evolving and other opportunities that might exist in that space for itself, if you think about long duration storage?Robert C. FrenzelYes, happy to. Look, as we think about it as a company, first utility to announce 100% carbon free. Given our geographic position, our ability to transition with wind and solar cost effectively for our customers through the end of this decade allowed us to make an interim target of an 80% carbon reduction, we feel very confident in that. But we've always been focused on we need new technology, new research, development and deployment of new technologies to achieve our 100% goal in the nation's clean energy goal One of the big pieces of that is obviously energy storage. We have a lot of lithium ion for our batteries around the country, and we have some on our own systems. The long-duration energy storage is a critical part of the energy future. And so the Form Energy battery is a 100-megawatt hour battery. So instead of 4 hours, it's 4 days. And that's a nice asset class as we think about periods when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. And we've seen evidence of that as recently as early June of this year. In the Southwest, where we had very limited wind production. We've seen it in polar vortexes, where in Winter Storm Uri, where we had no wind production for almost a 3-day period. So this idea of a long-duration battery is really interesting. What's exciting about Form, in particular, it's a pretty old technology really. This was found by the Department of Energy almost 60 years ago. But it's becoming commercializable by a new company, Form Energy and they're a breakthrough energy VC-funded company, an Energy Impact Partners-funded company. And the technology is pretty interesting. I want to call it simple because that would minimize the impact and the efforts of the development team and the founders of that company but it's basically resting and de rusting iron. And the great part about that is iron is readily available. It's domestically available, not subject to counter parties and regimes in the world where we have challenges. And so when I think about new technologies, sometimes it's not the best that wins, it's the one that's most commercializable and the 1 that can deploy the fastest. And I was really proud to be in West Virginia last month and breaking ground with the Form Energy team with Secretary Grand Home and Sender Mansion. We're building an 800-megawatt capable factory in West Virginia as we speak, with low guarantees and grants from the government. So this is a technology that's going to come to fruition. It's a technology that's going to be scalable. We're really pleased to be their first partner in sales of that, but it's a pilot. It's 10 megawatts and we're going to put it on a 9,000 megawatt system. So we have a great opportunity to build it with them and invest alongside and then the breakthrough energy grants and the potential DOE grants buy down that cost and buy down that risk for the company. So very exciting technology, really excited about the future, what this can mean.Paul Andrew JohnsonAnd Carla, I would just add, we have another pilot in Colorado (inaudible), which is a liquid metal technology that we'll have online in 2024. That's a to duration, so kind of call it mid duration. So we're spending a lot of time on this new technology. And I think also longer term, if we kind of broaden the definition of energy storage, green hydrogen is a form of energy storage as we think about longer term, be able to store and then burn it through some of our firm to stash all units longer term. So we're pretty excited about a lot of you call it new technologies and glad really happy to see how excited our Minnesota commission is on form energy with the unanimous approval of that project.Carly S. DavenportAwesome. I appreciate those perspectives. And then the follow-up just around earnings guidance, and obviously, you're reiterating the guidance for 2020. I just wanted to check in on temperature on the 5% to 7% long-term guidance. As you kind of think about the incremental spending opportunities from a CapEx perspective along with some of the regulatory outcomes that you've seen kind of how are you thinking about that long-term range?Brian J. Van AbelYes, Carla, good question. And we fully expect to continue delivering in the upper half of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance. So that's unchanged. I think you mentioned the incremental opportunities that we have. And I think in Bob's comments, he mentioned the Sherco Solar free Farm, the SPS, the 418 megawatts of solar farms that are going to provide significant customer benefits in SPS. We filed that CCN yesterday. So those 2 together are north of $1 billion of clean energy investments that will benefit our customers that are outside of our current capital plan.And I think longer term, right, we'll file here in Q3 or preferred plan or with the Colorado Commission around our RFP going into that, those decided pre IRA with the commission ruled on that resource spend before we could layer on the significant benefits significant customer benefits of the IRA. So when we look at how the costs are coming in relative to what was approved, we believe we will go bigger and faster and above what the initial 4,000 megawatts of renewables in stored showed. So we're excited to work with our Colorado Commission on that, look for that filing in Q3 and hopefully give a decision then even more longer term in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll be filing more RFPs in Minnesota, Colorado and SPS for further significant additions of clean energy assets as we march towards a 0 by 2030 goal. So I'm pretty excited about it, pretty excited about long-term opportunities, and we do feel good about delivering in the upper half of our long-term guidance range.OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.Steven Isaac FleishmanOne marshall fire question. Is there a deadline when any claims need to be filed?Robert C. FrenzelYes. Steve, it's Bob. My understanding is that claims are a 2-year deadline. So that would say the end of this year is when claims need to be filed.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Second question, a different topic on the Colorado settlement. Is there -- I know I think you mentioned Q3 for the final orderr. Is there a specific date for that approval?Paul Andrew JohnsonThere's not a date, Steve, but we expect that the commissioner rule probably in the middle of August, whole deliberations in the middle of August.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And then lastly, just I know you all have been pretty focused on a number of IRA provisions, including the hydrogen one. And I'm just kind of curious latest thoughts on the ability to look at hydrogen production green hydrogen, all those kind of pillars of the green hydrogen, when do you think you'll get -- we'll get that out and whether nuclear might be included in that or this additionality going to be a problem for that?Robert C. FrenzelYes, Steve, it's Bob. Thanks for the question. We've been very active in clean fuels in general and hydrogen in particular. Look, philosophically, we believe that we're going to undergo a large period of electrification over the next 10 or 20 years as a country and as a company, but that there are parts of the economy that are going to be difficult or expensive or even in some cases, impossible to electrify. And therefore, we feel like we need a clean molecule to help in those areas. And today, that's natural gas. But tomorrow, most promising molecule that we see is a green hydrogen molecule. And this looks like it's an opportunity for the company. It's another version of fuel for fuel at some level. set of government supportive of it. The states are supportive of it. And we've got 2 hydrogen hub applications. One in the Rocky Mountain region with MOUs from 4 states 2 of which we serve Colorado and New Mexico as well as Utah and Wyoming.And then here in the upper Midwest, 5-state MOU, again, 2 of which 3 of it that we serve, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana. And we're in front of the DOE, those have progressed through the process, and we expect to know by the end of the year, whether we're going to get duly loan -- grants for hydrogen. And I think you're aware of some of the challenges around what qualifies for a tax credit in hydrogen land. And I think there's sort of 3 areas of sort of debate. And what we're trying to do is balance cost to the customer and a need to accelerate OEMs to build and take us down the technology curve of electrolyzers and balance of plant. And I think about those as location generation matching and then additionality. So with respect to location, we've been -- in all 3 of those on 1 end, we think we need flexibility in all 3 of those categories. On the location, we've been supporting as a company, a balancing area type location, but certainly not national, which causes real market distortions and challenges with generation nationally. Similarly on matching, I think that the pure level would say we need hourly matching, but we probably need some transition period to get to that strict hourly matching. And so we've been supportive of some period of time where maybe by the end of the decade or late this decade, we've got hourly matching, but we'll go to annually matching for some period of time. And then with additionality, again, very supportive of the additionality as a concept but areas of flexibility there. One, we would really support nuclear in regards to additionality, and we have supported pretty vocally that as well as any sort of otherwise back down energy we would support that as additionality if it came back into the grid. And so very active -- we're very active at EEI, we're very active. And I think those are generally in line with principles that both of those organizations are supporting.Paul Andrew JohnsonSteve, you asked about timing. The statutory deadline in August 22. And they haven't missed a statutory deadline yet, but what we're hearing is that there's still a lot of uncertainty around the position of it outlined given some of the polarizing viewpoints. So it certainly could slip into September or October.OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi.Ryan Michael LevineIn terms of the $500 million insurance, what was the cost of that insurance and when was it occurred? And then I guess, going forward, are you seeing changes in pricing for wildfire-related insurance? And what's your strategy on a go-forward basis related to insurance?Brian J. Van AbelW haven't disclosed the cost, Ryan, and every year we renew our insurance program, and we continue to look at that. Insurance program is for everything is based on market experience for the insurance companies. And as you can imagine, it gets more challenged all the time, that's not just related to wildfire, but that's what all we have to say about insurance.Ryan Michael LevineHave you already procured it in '23 for the next year? Or is that an upcoming event for the back half of the year?Brian J. Van AbelWe're still in the process.Ryan Michael LevineOkay. And I guess one last question on that. I mean, so the $500 million, any associated costs with procuring it. Is that passed on to ratepayers? Or is that embedded in your O&amp;M cost outlook?Brian J. Van AbelIt's recovered through rate cases, yes and it's included in O&amp;M.Ryan Michael LevineIt's included in...Brian J. Van AbelIt's included in O&amp;M.OperatorThank you. As we have no further questions in the queue, I will turn the call back over to CFO, Brian Van Abel for closing remarks.Brian J. Van AbelThank you all for participating in our earnings call this morning. Please contact our Investor Relations team with any follow-up. Thank you.OperatorThat concludes today's conference.

92,dd704466-4775-3272-a7f6-e9e20f0f32cb,LUV,2023-07-28,Southwest Airlines’ Former CEO Gary Kelly Was Right About the Corporate Travel Recovery,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-former-ceo-gary-193313887.html,1690486393,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines’ Former CEO Gary Kelly Was Right About the Corporate Travel RecoverySouthwest Airlines former CEO Gary Kelly‘s firm belief that the industry was in for a slow corporate travel recovery is looking increasingly prescient. Southwest is undertaking the not-so-simple task of redesigning its network to reflect a future with fewer road warriors for some years to come.“I expect business to come back, but I think it’s going to trail the restoration of leisure for a while,” Southwest’s current CEO Bob Jordan, who replaced Kelly in February 2022, said during the carrier’s second-quarter earnings call Thursday.While Jordan did not say when he expects corporate demand to recover from the pandemic, given we’re already three years into the rebound, Kelly’s forecast of a 5-10 year business travel recovery is looking increasingly accurate. Southwest’s network changes, which Jordan said will drive roughly $500 million in incremental pre-tax profits next year, will only begin in January and be completed by March — or four years into the Covid recovery, and only a year shy of Kelly’s expectations.The return of corporate travelers has broadly stalled in the U.S. In recent comments, executives at Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines all put the recovery of the segment, at least among large, managed accounts, at roughly 75-80% of 2019 levels. Most are optimistic that the recovery of corporate demand will resume after Labor Day, the symbolic end of summer in the U.S., but in a measured, gradual manner.Continued recovery or not, Southwest is preparing for a future where there are fewer road warriors who need a 6 a.m. flight from, say, Chicago to Columbus, and more travelers — whether for a business, leisure, or blended trip — from Chicago to Phoenix, or Columbus to Tampa. Hence the network rejig.The changes are four-fold as Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained. The first is to remove some short-haul flights in favor of more medium- to long-haul ones; for example, Southwest will end service between Burbank and San Francisco in January. Second, the carrier will reduce flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays — the weekdays with the lowest travel demand — by 7-10% compared to other weekdays; previously it only reduced its schedule by roughly 2% on those days. Third, Southwest will shift some early morning and late night flights to more attractive times of day. And, fourth, the airline will reduce some of its Hawaii flying to reflect seasonal demand shifts, with executive comments suggesting a pull back in inter-island capacity.Story continues“It’s kind of a mix shift at the margin, not unlike going to the other guardrail so to speak,” Watterson said. “You do this to all of our network, it leads to a substantial change, but each one is modest.”The changes to Southwest’s network are set to begin in January and be complete by March. And, as a result, the airline plans to slow overall annual capacity growth to the “mid-single digits” in 2024 from up 14-15% this year as it continues to rebuild from the pandemic.Asked by J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker if the slow corporate travel recovery is in any way connected to Southwest’s operational meltdown during the year-end holidays last year, Jordan responded with a firm no.“As you think about demand for the brand, demand for the product that shows up, obviously, in bookings,” Jordan continued. “We’re just not seeing any sign of weakness.”Some other highlights from Southwest’s second-quarter call.U.S. Airline Yields Peaked in 2022If there was any question — and there should not be — yields, and airfares, for U.S. domestic travel peaked last summer. That was true in Southwest’s results and at its domestic-oriented competitors. Southwest saw unit revenues, measured in RASM (revenue per available seat mile) down 8.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, and forecast to fall 3-7% in the third quarter. Chief Commercial Officer Ryan Green said Thursday fares remain elevated but, when compared to the records set in 2022, the comparisons are difficult. And he is right, unit revenues at Southwest, while down from last year, are still up 12% from 2019 levels.Domestic Travel Demand is Strong“We’re seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked, expected to also be a record,” Green said. Southwest carried 8.5% more passengers in the second quarter than it did a year ago, and 5% more than in 2019. While capacity was also up from four years ago — 6.5% to be exact, compared to a 14% year-over-year increase — Southwest executives and other data points all indicate that more and more people are flying. They’re just not paying as much to fly on domestic flights this year as they did a year ago.And The NumbersSouthwest posted a $795 million operating profit in the second quarter, and an 11.5% operating margin excluding special items. Revenue increased nearly 5% year-over-year to $7 billion, while expenses rose faster at 12% to $6.2 billion. The faster cost growth was attributed to higher labor expenses and maintenance needs for the airline’s fleet of Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, were up 8%.This story is from Skift's Airline Weekly. For more aviation industry news visit airlineweekly.com.]"

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.Frank George MorganGood morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's press release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.Story continuesSamuel N. HazenGood morning. Thank you for joining the call. The company produced solid earnings in the second quarter. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins. Across most areas of our business, we maintain the operational momentum that we experienced over the past 3 quarters. We believe this strength should continue into the second half of the year. Accordingly, we updated our earnings guidance for 2023 to reflect this outlook. Against the difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2022, and diluted earnings per share increased to $4.29. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong. Admissions grew 2.2% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries increased 1.8%, same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.7%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.7% and outpatient surgeries which grew 3.3%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures which increased 5%. The growth in volumes was broad-based across the company's divisions and diversified within most service lines. Additionally, volumes were supported by strong acuity growth of 1.6% and a favorable payer mix from commercial adjusted admissions growth of 5%. These factors drove an increase in same-facility revenue of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we continued to invest in our people, and as a result, we saw improvements across virtually all key labor metrics. Turnover continued to decline for nurses and trended at an annualized rate of 17%. Nurse hiring remained strong in the quarter and for the year has increased by 9% as compared to last year. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 20% compared to the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we improved available bed capacity, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined and represented 0.8% of total admissions, down from 1.5% in the first quarter. We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide even higher quality care to our patients. As we look to the future, we remain encouraged by both the backdrop of strong demand that we expect in our markets and our overall competitive positioning within them. HCA Healthcare will continue to use its disciplined operating culture to execute our strategic and capital allocation plans. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and their overall effectiveness. So let me close with this. I want to speak to a recent event that we take very seriously. On July 10, we announced that we had recently discovered a list of certain information with respect to some of our patients, was made available by an unknown and unauthorized party on an online forum. We have confirmed that the list does not include clinical information, payment information or other sensitive information like passwords, drivers license or social security numbers. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, but this event appears to be a theft from an external storage location that was exclusively used to format e-mail messages. We are in the process of notifying all affected patients in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. And not unexpectedly, we have been named as a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits. This incident has not caused any disruption to our day-to-day operations nor do we believe it will materially impact our business or financial results. HCA Healthcare believes the privacy of its patients is a vital part of its mission and remains committed to maintaining the security of their personal information. With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results.William B. RutherfordGreat. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 7% to $15.86 billion from $14.82 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4% growth in equivalent admissions and 2.9% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in the Valesco joint venture and we are now consolidating the operations of this venture. This reduced our consolidated margins approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. We believe this transaction not only mitigates business risk with the Envision bankruptcy proceedings but will also further support alignment between our hospital-based physicians and our hospital care teams on improving quality, patient satisfaction, and efficiencies. When you consider this transaction and the $145 million payer settlement we recognized last quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margins have remained consistent between the first and second quarters. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $845 million in the quarter from $1.63 billion in the prior year to $2.475 billion this year. Capital spending was just over $1.2 billion. We paid $164 million in dividends and repurchased $915 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 to 4x. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $63.25 billion and $64.75 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.9 billion and $5.255 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.70 and $18.90, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion during the year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&amp;A.Frank George MorganThank you, Bill. (Operator Instructions) Bailey, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe just -- I know Sam in his prepared remarks said that performance was solid across divisions. I wondered, there's been some discussion this quarter about Florida and Texas had come back early and had enjoyed strong volume. Now the rest of the country is rebounding. I wonder if you could comment on that. There was also a discussion from some of the managed care guys about particularly seeing strength in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and some pent-up demand being unleashed there. I wondered if you would comment on whether you're seeing any of that as well.Samuel N. HazenAll right. Thank you, A.J. As I mentioned in my comments, our volume growth was broad-based across our divisions. I think we had 13 out of 16 divisions in the company that had admission growth and adjusted admission growth. We clearly have some divisions that don't perform the same pretty much every quarter, but it was fairly broad-based across top line metrics, admissions, adjusted admissions, payer mix improvements and so forth. So a fairly consistent performance. We did have a couple of divisions that struggled, but one was isolated in Florida. The other one was isolated more out west in the Midwest. And so for the most part, we were really pleased with the overall performance that we had across the geographies of the company. And it's interesting, I was looking at something yesterday. We have, from an admission standpoint, almost 72% of our hospitals have greater than 2% admission growth for the year, and this includes a little bit of pressure from COVID in the first part of the year from a comparison standpoint. We have very significant performance from the surgery standpoint as well, where almost 50% of our hospitals have inpatient surgery growth above 2%. So really consistent portfolio performance that speaks to the strength of our markets, I think the competitive positioning of our facilities and then the ongoing network development and physician development that we have as part of our core strategy.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.Benjamin HendrixWith regard to your updated guidance, can you provide some more color on what you're assuming for SWB, supplies and other operating expense, particularly professional fees through the second half versus what you've seen thus far this year? And then anything to call out that would alter a typical cadence through the second half?William B. RutherfordYes, Ben, this is Bill. Let me start. I think our updated guidance reflects what we're reserving -- observing in the market on our year-to-date performance, which continue(technical difficulty)in the growth opportunities. I think net-net, when I think about the margin profile of the company between the first half and the second half of the year, we'd expect the margin profile to be slightly better in the second half of the year. I think our salary, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue will run mostly where they're running year-to-date. Same with supplies. We have seen a little pressure on the professional fees. And we don't think that same pressure will exist in the balance of the year but will be able to manage through that.OperatorThe next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.Benjamin Whitman MayoMaybe just a question around labor. I think I heard you say, Bill, that contract labor improved maybe 20% year-over-year. Did it change much throughout the quarter? Just trying to get a sense of maybe the exit rate and expectations for the second half of the year?William B. RutherfordYes, Whit. I mean, we're pleased with the labor environment. We did mention our contract labor is down 20% versus the prior year. It's improved as well sequentially between Q2 and Q1. Our hiring metrics are up, turnover is down. And I think that portends good things for us going through the balance of the year. We mentioned before, our contract labor cost as a percentage of our SWB was under 7% -- I think it was 6.8% in the quarter. So again, I think we're pleased with that, especially as we go through the summer months, some of our hires get through kind of their orientation process and that we get into the balance of the year, we would expect some continued improvement.OperatorThe next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.Gary Paul TaylorJust 2 quick ones for me. Bill, I might have missed it, but I know often you kind of run through some of the managed care metrics on admissions -- adjusted admission and surgeries, I wondering if you could rattle off a few of those for us? And then secondly, I just want to make sure I understood on the Envision joint venture, I think we were thinking that was maybe roughly $250 million of revenue. But do all the expenses lie in the SWB line? Is that where those reside down to kind of a roughly EBITDA breakeven?William B. RutherfordYes. Gary, let me start with that. Some of our managed care, I think as we mentioned and the -- Sam mentioned in the comments, really favorable payer mix. Our managed care admissions were up over 4% in the quarter. Adjusted admissions were 5%. I think we mentioned that in our prepared comments. Emergency visits managed care were up 9.8% in the quarter, and again, good acuity of case mix growth. So we're really pleased with the payer mix that we're seeing, and that showed itself in the commercial trends. Relative to the Valesco joint venture, your numbers are really close. About 70% to 75% of the revenue is in SWB and the rest is in other operating. And you're right, it's basically a breakeven proposition a little north of $220 million of revenue that we had in the quarter as we consolidated that.OperatorAnd your next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.Justin LakeQuestion on the pricing in the quarter. So with strong acuity and strong and strong payer mix, maybe can you remind us, is there anything in the second quarter that I might have slipped that, drove the pricing? I would have expected it to be a little bit better given those mix items and strong commercial pricing. And then, Bill, can you just give us what you expect in the back half of the year for volumes with that updated guidance?William B. RutherfordYes. Justin, nothing specific, we'll call out. I mean, obviously when we do year-over-year comparisons, COVID was still an impact for us. We had roughly $40 million of COVID support payments last year that we don't have this year. Our COVID admissions were 3% of total last year, roughly 1%. So that's still influencing a little bit on the revenue line. On our volume projections for the balance of the year, I think we'll be largely consistent. We've seen thus far, our year-to-date admissions same-facility are about 3.3%. I would think for the full year, we hover around 3% as well for the balance of the year. Our adjusted admissions year-to-date are 5.6%. I would think by the time we finish full year, it's still 5% to 6% adjusted admissions. So I think the volume trends we would expect in the second half of the year will be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year.OperatorAnd the next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringAs I look at the implied revenue raise and EBITDA raise at the back half of the year, I'm trying to understand the flow-through of how much revenue raises should flow through into EBITDA upside. So how is it tracking in sort of 2023 versus sort of pre-COVID years?William B. RutherfordWell, when I think about that, when I look at the raise, it's based on where we perform them in our view of the position going forward. We do expect continued improvement in the labor market. But as I said, I think as a percent of revenue, we hold, I think the margin profile overall for the second half of the year will be slightly better than the margin profile we saw in the first half of the year. And that, all in all, has contributed in to the guidance raise. I remind you, we've raised our guidance almost the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance, roughly $450 million from where we turn the calendar. So I think all that's reflective in our considerations right now.Samuel N. HazenYes. And Bill, let me add a point here. I think it's a relevant point. Obviously, we've dealt with a fairly unprecedented labor market over the last 3 years or so. And we do believe, as Bill indicated earlier, it's moderating. We've also dealt with sort of an unprecedented hospital-based physician dynamic at a macro level. And if you just take a snapshot of where we are 6 months into this year versus where we were pre-pandemic when neither of these macro forces were in place, we've actually increased our margins by comparison to 2019. So I think it's sort of a testament to the ability of the company to adjust operationally to dynamics and continue to move forward with our strategy. As we've mentioned before, we think our competitive positioning has improved compared to where we were pre-pandemic. Our market share has also improved during that time period. So we continue to believe that the company has the wherewithal to adjust to these factors, continue to move ahead in a very positive way and generate the results that we all want.OperatorAnd your next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group.Ann Kathleen HynesI know it's early, but do you have any observations on how Medicaid determinations is impacting your business? I know one of your bigger states, Texas, started early. It sounds like it's been a little bit messy. So any early observations? And can you remind us if you have anything from the Medicaid redeterminations in your guidance? And do you think this process is going to be an overall positive or negative for HCA?William B. RutherfordYes. Thanks for that. It's a good question. And you're right, it is still early, and we've got a pretty organized approach to not only continue to watch the market but respond to -- on there. So we haven't seen any negative or any material impact on this today. We think what we're seeing many of the patients who are receiving determination, that -- there's some opportunity to continue to get them reenrolled in Medicaid, Some of them are more technical. They either didn't complete an application or some other aspect of that. So our teams are trying to identify those individuals as best they can, assist them in gaining coverage, which remain encouraged by many of the studies that the people who are being redetermined off, who will qualify either for coverage in an employer sponsor plan or qualify for coverage in the health insurance marketplace. And so we'll continue to watch that as that unfolds. But no impact right now. Nothing in our guidance is assumed for Medicaid redetermination. We believe over the long run, there could be some positive trends from this but we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Mark FischbeckI wanted to just maybe dig in a little bit more to kind of how you're thinking about the volume growth in the back half of the year. I guess when you think about (inaudible) trending relatively similar in the back half versus the first half, I guess the way we had been thinking about it any way, it was that last year it felt like as COVID spiked at the beginning of the year and then became less and less of an issue that volumes started to kind of normalize in the back half of the year. And so that maybe the comp would be a little more difficult as you got into Q4 and if the growth rate might slow. So I just want to think about how you're thinking about volume growth and where you are versus maybe long-term trend lines and things like that. How do you put that into context about thinking this rate of growth will continue in the back half of the year?Samuel N. HazenKevin, this is Sam. Let me give you sort of the backdrop, we think, of what exists for us with respect to volume. And this is more of a general commentary. I'll let Bill sort of reconcile the back half of the year to the first half of the year with numbers, I'm not sure I can do that at this particular point in time. As we said before, and we continue to believe this we feel that within our markets, there's unique attributes that are driving solid demand for health care services. Population growth continues to be strong in Texas and Florida, in Utah, Nevada, South Carolina, pretty much Tennessee. Across the board, we're experiencing population growth within our markets. The second point is we're investing very significantly in our strategy and our positioning within these communities so that we can respond to our patient needs, put our facilities in the best position to grow. And we think that's going to help us sustain market share growth as we move forward. What we're seeing is that our overall volume assumptions are supported by acuity. Acuity has maintained, some of that strategic, some of that, I think, is the dynamics that exist within the markets. And then the second support mechanism that's in place, and we view this positively, is the payer mix dynamic. We have seen throughout the first half of the year, commercial admissions outpaced our total admissions. Again, we think that's reflective of a strong economy and job positioning that a lot of people have in our communities as well as the exchanges. And so we think those will continue on into the last half of this year. And we're optimistic that those will continue on into the future, at least in the near-term. So Bill, you can maybe try to reconcile...William B. RutherfordI'll just say, I mean, when we think about projecting going forward, we try to take all of those factors into consideration, as Sam mentioned and where we're seeing year-to-date. Mind you, when we originally said our guidance, we anticipated 1% to 2% admission growth, mid-single-digit outpatient growth. So that's still hovering around 2% to 3% equivalent admission growth was our expectation. And given the fact that we're seeing north of 3% admission growth and 5.5% of adjusted admission, that's informing our position for the balance of the year. So I still think around 3 is a good number for the full year now based on the first 6 months of the year. We're continuing to see good outpatient revenue growth. And so that should support this 5% to 6% equivalent admission expectation for the full year.Samuel N. HazenYes. And Bill, if I can add one thing. With respect to our investments in our networks. We have, at this particular juncture, the largest pipeline of projects that are in motion, including our outpatient development components which are very robust as well as other inpatient and facility needs there. So our pipeline from an organic standpoint as far as capital that we will see hit the market in latter '23, '24, early '25 is more robust than we've seen in pretty much recent years.OperatorThe next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.Brian Gil TanquilutBill, you touched on the impact of Envision being a 30 basis point drag. I know there's some -- a lot of noise happening with American Physician Partners and just stuff moving around the physician staffing. So as we think about that drag, is there opportunity to bring that up? Or is that like a more structural thing where you've had to bring in, in-house capabilities for physician staffing?Samuel N. HazenYes. This is Sam. Let me start with that and Bill can color in here. As I mentioned, the backdrop in the hospital-based physician space has been very difficult over the past few years because of multiple factors. And for us, in the short run, we have had to respond to these difficulties to maintain capacity and service availability and so forth. And so we did what we had to do to make sure that our business continue to move forward appropriately. And for the most part, we've overcome these pressures and been able to grow, and we've increased our earnings expectations for the year in the face of some of these challenges. As Bill mentioned, we don't anticipate the same level of increases and pressures in the last half of the year, although we'll have some. But it's not going to nearly be what we've experienced in the first part, we don't think. And we do believe with the Valesco operations, we now have a platform that gives us the potential to respond better to these type of challenges and possibly integrate hospital-based physicians into our hospital operations even more effectively, producing better clinical performance efficiency and even growth, we think. And so -- and I'll say this again, I said it earlier, we have a pattern of responding to different kind of operational challenges, whatever they happen to be. We've had labor, as I mentioned. We've had physician costs. Currently, we've had uninsured in the past. And we've tended to overcome them. In the short run, sometimes they can create an individual pressure. But I think the scale of HCA, the resources that we have and the ability to execute allows us to move through some of these pressures over time and get where we want to be.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesI've got a strategic question for you on digital health and AI. I was just interested in the initiatives that you're kind of putting in place through the organization at this point, where you're maybe investing on the venture capital side here. And long term, what do you see is the opportunity for this, whether it's potentially reduced compensation or an ability to expand volume across the footprint?Samuel N. HazenThis is Sam. We have a growing digital agenda in our company, and I'm very excited about what the prospects are for us around that. We are investing in a new clinical system, which we think is going to allow us to move information to the cloud more efficiently, and a matter of fact, move standard data sets into the cloud so that we can then use big data even more effectively and infuse that back into the care process. We will couple our digital agenda with something we're calling care transformation &amp; innovation. And inside of that, we believe we have opportunities to improve care processes, eliminate a lot of the variation that exists today in our company, creating better quality and, at the same time, more efficiencies. Artificial intelligence, we believe, will play a huge part in that. It's way early for us to know exactly what that will be and how that will influence our agenda, but we're encouraged about the prospects for it. We are partnering with some very sophisticated companies to help us push through this in ways that I think will accelerate our agenda and inform it with more expertise than what we have internally. So we're excited about what this can yield for us as we push into our next life cycle, if you will. And we'll wait to see what artificial intelligence, in fact, can do. But we view it as a positive potential for us in a very significant way.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS.Andrew MokI just wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion maybe from a different angle. Revenue per outpatient equivalent looks, like it was down about 1% in the quarter, which seems to be weighing on strong inpatient pricing up 6%. Can you help us understand the pricing and mix trends across your outpatient platform that are causing that unit revenue metric to blend down this year?William B. RutherfordWell, I'd say we're pleased with the outpatient growth that we're seeing. If you look at the overall outpatient growth that we have, it's -- our expectation was mid-single digits. We're well north of that in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. There's always a little bit of a mix issue that occurs. Our emergency room volume was up, what, 3.7%, which [were] a lot of are outpatient. Our outpatient surgical growth was up 3.3% in the quarter. So I think those are really good stats. On the outpatient revenue, per unit. There's always a blend between surgical, emergency room and diagnostic. But I would say, overall, we're very pleased with the outpatient overall growth that we are seeing.Samuel N. HazenYes. And Bill, just the second quarter overall outpatient revenue growth was actually up over the first quarter. So we are seeing some acceleration. There's a lot of moving parts, as Bill just alluded to, to outpatient revenues between physician, clinics, urgent care, all the way up to outpatient cardiology procedures, which tend to be our highest reimbursed type of procedures. And so the mix of that can influence the outpatient. We tend to look at it in the aggregate. And for the most part, our aggregate revenue growth has been stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. And then within sort of the pricing elements, we continue to get the targeted price increases that we want in both our inpatient and our outpatient businesses. So it's more, to Bill's point, sort of the mix and the mixture of all of the different components in a way that has produced solid growth for us.OperatorNext question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.Calvin Alexander SternickI wanted to ask about the commercial rate cycle. I think last quarter, you said you guys are about 2/3 of the way through 2024 and about 1/4 of the way through 2025. Can you give us an update on the progress and how those rate discussions are evolving?William B. RutherfordYes. They're evolving pretty consistent. As we just mentioned, we're continuing to see rates in kind of the mid-single digit level. As far as contracted for '24, I think we're a little north of 70% for '24 now. And I think our efforts continue. I think our relationships with our major payers continue to be strong and we're pleased with the progress we're making in that area.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott J. FidelInterested just as against the backdrop where the managed care payers are seeing the higher medical cost trends this year, whether you're seeing any changes in behaviors when interfacing with them from a prior authorization or utilization management-type perspective? Or are things pretty consistent there? And then just a quick follow-up, just on the slight raise in the CapEx. Is that just related to the general broad-based investments that Sam just talked about? Or are there any specific projects that you would cite around the update to the CapEx guide?William B. RutherfordYes, Let me try to take both of those. I think as we maybe mentioned in the past, as you think about authorization and medical necessity reviews, those activities have picked up again as -- during the COVID period of time, those have eased a little bit. But we still see a lot of friction, if you will, as you go through that effort. We work with our payers to try to resolve those appropriately, make sure that we defend our positions where necessary. But there is a level of activity that both us and the payers have to devote to try to smooth through that process. But we tend to be able to work our way through it. On the CapEx, I think it's simply reflective of the oportunities we see in the market to continue to deploy capital for growth. Fortunately, we continue to see really strong cash flow to be able to support that CapEx. And again, I think it's reflective of the growth opportunities we see in the market.Samuel N. HazenAnd Bill, as we mentioned on the last call, we have acquired some land for future expansion in some of these fast-growing markets that we serve, and that's put some upward pressure on our capital spending. But we believe those are long-term good decisions for us.OperatorThe next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi Group.Jason Paul CassorlaYes. Great. Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the labor front. Thinking about all the efforts and programs you put in place contributing to the better turnover in hiring trends, I guess, is there a way to help frame what inning you're in as it relates to these efforts? Where do you like to see some of the outputs on turnover retention kind of move to? Or any other thoughts on the labor front and the trajectories there?Samuel N. HazenYes. This is Sam. Thank you for that question. As I mentioned, we have invested very heavily in our people agenda over the past few years. We've increased our capacity within our recruiting function. Our recruiting efforts are yielding strong hiring, and we believe that will continue on into the latter half of the year. Our retention efforts with respect to responding to our employees' needs so that they have the necessary resources and tools to be effective in their day-to-day jobs, we're getting better at that. That's helping turnover. Turnover is approaching pre-pandemic levels, especially in the nursing area. We are a few points above pre-pandemic. But if you annualize the second quarter turnover, it would suggest less than that. So we're encouraged by that, and we do believe we have opportunities to continue improvement in that area. With contract labor, as Bill mentioned, we expect to see improvements as we move through the last half of the year. And then I'm very excited about our workforce development initiatives. We continue to invest heavily in Galen College of Nursing. They're expanding each quarter, it seems, into new markets and establishing new relationships and new opportunities for people and for our company. And then we're also investing in our -- what we're calling our Centers for Clinical Advancement, which is our ongoing clinical education for our people so that they can upskill their capabilities and competencies and put them in a position to either deliver better care or grow in their own individual career. So what inning are we in? We're in the middle innings in some of the areas. And so we will wait to see how the latter half of the year plays out. But all in all, I think tremendous results. We're very competitive, we believe, across the organization with our compensation and benefit programs. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate through these difficult periods and maintain margins. I think our labor costs -- again, if you just look at 2019 as a proxy, our labor cost in 2023 are below as a percent of revenue 2019. And again, that's in the very -- in the face of a very difficult labor market.OperatorThe next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.Jamie Aaron PerseCan you comment on seasonality expectations for the third quarter? Anything beyond normal seasonality from a headwind or tailwind perspective that we should be thinking about? And I think normally, revenue is down slightly and EBITDA down maybe mid-single digits to high single digits. Is that the right way to be thinking about the third quarter? And anything in July that's informing that? And then there was an earlier question on backlog that may not have been fully answered. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that as well.Samuel N. HazenWe mentioned at the end of the fourth quarter that we were starting to see normal seasonality patterns materialize. And we've seen that so far through the first half of this year, and we think that will continue on into the second half of this year. The third quarter is not as strong as the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is always the strongest quarter of the year for us given the outpatient activity and deductibles and so forth. And so we think the third and fourth quarter will be similar in patterns to pre-pandemic seasonality. And that's what's reflected in our guidance.OperatorAnd the next question will come from Steven Valiquette.Steven James ValiquetteSo I guess as a follow-up to just some of these prior questions on the labor and commercial rate update. There was some conjecture for HCA that the company didn't have quite as many commercial payer contracts up for renewal for fiscal '23 to capture some better rates for elevated labor costs, which you had more coming up for renewal in '24. Now that the noise levels kind of died down somewhat here in mid-23 on overall labor cost pressure versus -- something versus 12, 15 months ago, I guess the question is do you still have confidence to potentially capture potentially slightly better than average commercial rate updates for fiscal '24? Is labor pressure maybe still being the key variable within those discussions? Or are those going to be a little bit tougher now given that some of the pressure is subsided. Just want to get your kind of latest thoughts around that.Samuel N. HazenWell, this is Sam. Bill indicated that we're 70% contracted on '24 around our targeted escalation objective. Labor costs, as you mentioned, are moderating some. Yes, there's still inflationary pressures underneath it, as one would expect. Now we have physician cost pressures with respect to pro fees. And our belief is that, that will have to be paid for by someone. And so that will become a new factor in our thinking and our justification for appropriate price increases. So our cost -- we're not just one category. We have multiple categories, as you can see on the income statement. And all of that factors into our considerations when we're negotiating.OperatorAnd the next question will come from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinWere there any meaningful differences in the payer mix on the outpatient side, an obvious focus on Medicare and specifically Medicare Advantage volumes. And are you seeing anything in the Medicare market that would support higher levels of demand than we saw last quarter or the quarter before, anything that you feel like is inflecting?William B. RutherfordYes, Josh, when I look at kind of the admissions versus adjusted admissions between the payer categories, they're comparable. Our Medicare adjusted admissions were up 5%. Our managed care adjusted admissions were up 5%, as we mentioned earlier, fueled by emergency room growth. So I think the trends are pretty comparable among the payer categories. And that's strengthening payer mix, that's, I think, positive trends for us. So nothing else underneath the outpatient area that I would distinguish, other than we continue to see good commercial ER traffic. Our commercial outpatient was up pushing close to 4% as well. So again, I think they're pretty comparable in terms of the general trends we're seeing.Samuel N. HazenI would say, Bill, just to put a little bit of color on the outpatient. Our commercial outpatient revenue growth is clearly outpacing our Medicare outpatient revenue growth. Some of the adjusted admissions are influenced by some of the calculations, if you will. But we are seeing really solid commercial outpatient revenue growth, again, influenced by the ER, influenced by surgeries, which are represented by roughly 50% to 55% commercial. So good growth there. And all of that yields solid commercial revenue growth.OperatorThere are no further questions. At this time. Mr. Frank Morgan, I turn the call back over to you.Frank George MorganBailey, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call.

102,61d13461-085d-3c59-8437-60f94b0268d3,PPG,2023-07-28,5 Stocks Likely to Benefit as Fed Lifts Rates to a 22-Year High,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-likely-benefit-fed-142500675.html,1690467900,STORY,"['PPG', 'MFC.TO', 'CAT', 'CUK', 'MFC']","[The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and signaled the possibility of further increases ahead. This marks the 11th rate increase in more than a year, a streak that has made mortgages and other consumer and business loans increasingly expensive.The rate hike brings the benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to 5.25-5.50%, the highest level since March 2001. The increase in interest rates has made borrowing expensive, pushed up the cost of buying a new car or house, increased the cost of carrying credit card debt and slowed down economic growth.“Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,"" the Fed said in its statement. ""Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated."" Inflation in the United States cooled down for the 12th consecutive month in June, with the Consumer Price Index rising 3% year over year — the lowest rate since early 2021. Although inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1%, it has a long way to go to meet the Federal Reserve's 2% target.Sectors to BenefitHigher interest rates usually indicate a healthy economy, which leads to increased consumer confidence, rising wages and higher spending. This combination of factors will result in increased industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand, thereby lifting value stocks.As such, it will benefit cyclical sectors like financials, industrials and consumer discretionary. A rising interest rate scenario is highly profitable for the financial sector as the steepening yield curve would bolster profits for banks, insurance companies, discount brokerage firms and asset managers.Industrial sectors tend to benefit as a stronger economy can lead to increased business investment, infrastructure spending and demand for durable goods. These industries tend to perform well during periods of economic expansion. While rising interest rates can have negative implications for consumer spending, certain segments within the consumer discretionary sector can benefit. Companies that offer luxury goods and services, such as high-end retailers, luxury automobile manufacturers, and leisure and entertainment providers, may experience increased demand as the economy strengthens and consumer confidence remains intact.The materials sector, which includes companies involved in mining, chemicals, and forestry, can also benefit from a stronger economy driven by higher interest rates. As demand for goods and construction materials rises, companies in this sector may experience increased sales and potentially higher profitability.Further, a healthy economy also leads to increased consumer confidence, rising wages and higher spending. This combination of factors will result in increased industrial activity and a pickup in consumer demand, thereby lifting value stocks.Story continuesStocks to Bet OnAmid such a backdrop, we have highlighted stocks from these sectors poised to benefit from a rate hike decision. These include Manulife Financial Corp MFC, Carnival Corporation CCL, Caterpillar CAT, PPG Industries Inc. PPG, and Lifetime Brands LCUT.

That's because it's the summer of Barbie. Starring Margot Robbie, the movie phenomenon has already sold $356 million in tickets globally. Ynon Kreiz says they've captured a cultural moment while hinting that the holiday shopping season could be strong for Barbie related toys.Now this is a crucial area for the business, especially as Mattel only gets a fraction of the sales from its myriad of brand partnerships. Kreiz spoke with Yahoo Finance's executive editor, Brian Sozzi, on all of this and more. Take a listen.YNON KREIZ: It is great to see the success at the box office. We could not be more proud of Greta Gerwig's vision and execution of what is now becoming a true cultural phenomenon. It was never about just making a movie, we wanted to create an event. A cultural event. And it's exciting to see all of this, this vision, coming to fruition.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Can you-- before we get into the quarter as well, can you explain to investors what other content you have coming down the pike. And what is this movie mean for the potential profits from all this other content that you have coming?YNON KREIZ: You know, this movie is really a showcase for the cultural resonance of our brands, our ability to attract and collaborate with top talent, and very importantly, our capabilities to take our brands and elevate them to create cultural moments. It speaks to the potential of Mattel films and the significant progress we've made on our strategy to capture the full value of our IP.So it is an important moment for Barbie. It's a milestone moment for Mattel in executing our strategy. And also, it's a historic moment for cinema in bringing, for the first time, the Barbie brand to the big screen in live action. So exciting day, exciting time all around.BRIAN SOZZI: You're right. I mean, you have captured the cultural conversation, Ynon. Now, within that portfolio of content that you have, are there other Barbie type movies? And do you run that same distribution playbook?YNON KREIZ: Well, for Barbie itself, this is the beginning of a journey. Success breeds success, and we're not looking to stop here in terms of how far Barbie can grow and expand in terms of additional offering and additional movies, television series, and others.We also have 14 other movies in development. So we have a very strong slate of offering. And we're not saying that every movie will be as successful as Barbie, but we absolutely look to apply the same methodology, the same approach, in collaborating with top talent, entrusting and amplifying their creative vision, and bringing our own marketing and demand creation expertise to the table.So it's not just about owning the portfolio of a very strong collection of strong brands, but also partnering with creative talent and then amplifying what they do through our own marketing capabilities. And in this case, collaborating with Warner Brothers was a phenomenal success. Warner Brothers has done an amazing job in marketing the movie and collaborating with us on creating this event.Obviously, it all starts with having a very strong creative execution led by Greta Gerwig. A top talent, incredible cast led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. And an incredible music offering. The Barbie album, produced by Mark Ronson, that brought, to this project, some of the most celebrated music artists of our generation.So all of this combined around the Barbie brand, that, just as a reminder, was already a very strong brand coming into this project. A strong brand. One of the top brands in the industry. The number one brand in the entire toy industry for two years in a row. And of course, a very strong platform to create something so special and so unique.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's jump on to the earnings results, Ynon. Does this quarter get you down a little bit? Like, oh, shucks. I got a report down sales and down gross billings at the same time where a property in this movie is just blowing up?YNON KREIZ: This quarter, we continue to improve our position. We exceeded expectations, both at the top line and the bottom line. We grew our free cash flow by more than $200 million, and are still guiding free cash flow to exceed $400 million for the year. So we feel very good about this quarter. And believe the company is set to achieve the guidance that we put out for the full year.BRIAN SOZZI: Within that free cash flow outlook, Ynon, how do you plan to use that cash?YNON KREIZ: Well, we talked about our capital allocation priorities in terms of continuing to invest in organic growth for the company, continue to manage our balance sheet and maintain and strengthen our position financially. And as you know, we recently achieved investment-grade rating, which was an important milestone in our turnaround to achieve, in terms of our financial resilience and strength.We look to continue to pursue opportunities in terms of corporate development, M&amp;A and the like, and also continue to purchase shares to manage and optimize our overall financial standing and balance sheet as a whole. So it is part of our capital allocation priorities. And generating cash and having a strong financial profile is now becoming another important lever to execute our strategy.BRIAN SOZZI: We've been talking, the past few quarters, Ynon, about a more cautious consumer. And I see your sales down in this quarter. Are consumers spending a little bit more, are you seeing any improvement there?YNON KREIZ: Yes, we do expect to see a positive holiday season overall. But we have seen softness in the second quarter, more than we expected in the industry. That said, POS trends have improved significantly in heading into the third quarter to date. And we expect both total company and, of course, Barbie POS to be positive for the year.BRIAN SOZZI: I think you're going to get a lot of questions, Ynon, on given the popularity of the movie, you did beat expectations at least relative to analyst estimates for this quarter. Why not come out and raise your earnings guidance? Do you think Barbie has that power for this holiday season where you could see a lot of toy sales?YNON KREIZ: Well, we could not be more excited with where Barbie is today. Of course, the phenomenal success of the movie is an important driver that really speaks to the strategy. This is not just about the quarter, it's about our strategy. Our long-term franchise management strategy.But we still have 2/3 of the year to go in terms of our business. We're seeing softness in the industry. And we are maintaining guidance and expect to continue to grow share and strengthen our position for long-term growth.BRIAN SOZZI: I did not miss the fact that your inventory was down year-over-year. You've worked hard to get that inventory in the right shape. Are you happy with your inventories now? And is the retail inventory correction that you've been talking about, is that over?YNON KREIZ: Yeah, we've done a very good job managing our inventory. It's down over $200 million. And we're seeing an important improvement in retail inventory. By the end of the second quarter, retail inventory, in dollar terms, were down double digit relative to-- double digit percentage relative to last year.We believe the retail inventory correction is mostly behind us. This is what we expected entering the second quarter and we're seeing it playing out. And therefore, we do expect the industry to have a positive holiday season and for us to continue to gain share, given our success in executing our strategy.BRIAN SOZZI: You're losing your right hand man, Ynon, in Richard Dixon. He's decided to accept the role over at Gap. I mean, it's a tough loss, right?YNON KREIZ: Yeah, Richard is a friend. He's a colleague. We've been doing this together since I joined the company and we've had a great run. We wish him success. He's a great executive. And one of his greatest accomplishments at Mattel was to develop and build a very strong team around him.We promoting two world class executives to overtake what he did in terms of managing our franchises. This is Lisa McKnight, who will run the doll portfolio-- sorry, the toy portfolio, the categories, and all of our global brands. And Joe Silverman, who will run all of the non-toy related commercial activities.Two world class executives surrounded by a team of excellent executives. We could not be in a better position today.

And on top of it, everything we look to do in continue to expand our entertainment offering. So expect more to come.BRIAN SOZZI: I tried to maybe pull off a Ken outfit, Ynon, I can't do it.

Movie, the current box office leader. So it makes sense that Mattel and Warner Bros. are eager to make a sequel.For now, though, the visionary director who brought the Mattel toy to life says she’s not on board.Greta Gerwig, in an interview with the New York Times, downplayed the idea of Barbie as the next big franchise for the studio, despite its success.“At this moment, it’s all I’ve got,” she said. “I feel like that at the end of every movie, like I’ll never have another idea and everything I’ve ever wanted to do, I did. I wouldn’t want to squash anybody else’s dream, but for me, at this moment, I’m at totally zero.”Gerwig made history with Barbie, as the film broke records with $155 million at the box office. That’s the biggest opening weekend ever for a female director, beating Captain Marvel (which made $153 million in 2019 and was codirected by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck) and Patty Jenkins’s Wonder Woman ($103 million in 2017).Mattel, of course, could opt to move Barbie movies forward without Gerwig. And, in fact, the company seems set to do so. Speaking with Variety, CEO Ynon Kreiz, whose idea it was to create a Mattel cinematic universe, strongly implied there are plenty more stories to tell.“Barbie, as a brand, has many different iterations,” he said. The product lines of Barbie is a very broad brand. In addition to the main Barbie figure, she has family, she has a lot of elements around in her universe. It’s a very rich universe…It’s a very broad and very elastic brand, in terms of opportunities…At the outset, we’re not saying, ‘Okay, let’s think already about movie two and three.’ Let’s get the first one right and make that a success. And if you do that, opportunities open up very quickly, once you establish the first movie as a successful representation of a franchise on the big screen.”Story continuesMattel’s not stopping with Barbie. The toymaker has films in various stages of development for 14 of its lines, including Barney, Polly Pocket, Thomas &amp; Friends, and American Girl.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

This edition of the Impact Report will therefore be a bit different, with an overview of what you need to know and read this week.1. July is on track to be the hottest month ever. This should be a wake-up call for companies.No month in recorded global history was hotter than this July will have been, the World Meteorological Organization forecasted this week. The all-time record comes on the back of the hottest June ever, and at a time when record-breaking weather seems more the rule than the exception.The sobering statistic will be another argument for companies to adopt “net zero” transition plans. And it suggests that we're at the point where climate adaptation is necessary as well.“We need to adapt in a number of areas in our society,” Julie Arrighi, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center told me last week. “Business is one of them.”“Chief climate officers” and “chief heat officers” seem poised to become more than a gimmick going forward. They have their work cut out for them: starting with making heat plans, and ending with making contingency plans for company relocations.2. As Barbie hits the theaters, some real CSO Barbies speak out.Before there was Barbie, the movie, there was Barbie, the chief sustainability officer doll, made by Mattel as part of a set that also included conservation scientist, renewable energy engineer, and environmental advocate Barbies.This week two human CSOs, Kate Brandt at Google and Melanie Nakagawa at Microsoft, wrote in Fortune about how it feels to be “real-life versions of Mattel’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) Barbie.”Since the Barbie CSO line was launched, they write, “one of the persistent questions we have received is one that leaves us feeling conflicted, conjuring both a sense of pride but also of concern: What it means to be a 'woman leader'—in our industry, in the sustainability space, in the C-suite.”Story continues“From Jane Goodall to Christina Figueres to Greta Thunberg—women and girls have been at the forefront of leadership in combatting the climate crisis and environmental degradation,"" they point out. At the same time, they say, “we are also sensitive to how the 'feminization' of certain roles or types of work can be used as a way to minimize the importance of the work itself, as well as marginalize the women who are doing it.”CSO Barbie may be a kind of progress, they conclude, but ""we also look forward to the day when women’s leadership doesn’t need a special callout because it’s fully normalized within our workplaces and our societies."" Read their full article here.3. It’s time to talk about impact, again.When we met at last year's Fortune Impact Initiative, ESG was still on a high, and common sustainability standards were a pipe dream. What a contrast with the situation today, where ESG is increasingly shunned, and sustainability standardization is a de facto reality. After this rollercoaster year, we'll gather in Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 12–13 for the annual Impact Initiative.I'll cochair the conference with Holly Ojalvo, who edits this newsletter, and we’ll be diving into all of these issues, and many more. This year's speakers include the chief sustainability officers of Colgate-Palmolive, General Electric, General Motors, L’Oréal, Walmart, and impact and diversity executives from Cisco, Meta, Visa, PayPal, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.One question we'll be discussing is how recent legislation in the U.S. is helping achieve the “green transition” and decarbonization of the economy—which would be historically unprecedented if it's successful. We’ll also talk about board diversity, voter access, and the current state of impact investing, among other topics.

Gross margin benefited from Optimizing for Growth program, foreign exchange favorability as well as lower severance and restructuring expenses. However, inventory management efforts including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expense, cost inflation and an unfavorable fixed cost absorption negatively impacted the margin.During the quarter under discussion, adjusted other selling and administrative expenses declined $19 million year over year to $324 million. The downside was due to Optimizing for Growth program and cost management efforts.Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $299.9 million compared with $274.5 million as of Jun 30, 2022. Total inventories at the end of the second quarter came in at $971.6 million compared with $1,177.6 million reported in the prior year quarter.Long-term debt (as of Jun 30, 2023) was $2,327.8 million compared with $2,323.3 million as of Jun 30, 2022.

Joining me today are Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dickson, Mattel's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Mattel's Chief Financial Officer. As you know, this afternoon, we reported Mattel's 2023 second quarter financial results. We will begin today's call with Ynon and Anthony providing commentary on our results, after which, we will provide some time for Ynon, Richard and Anthony to take questions. To help supplement our discussion today, we have provided you with a slide presentation.

These statements are based on currently available information and assumptions, and they are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We describe some of these uncertainties in the Risk Factors section of our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K, our Q1 2023 quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our earnings release and presentation and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time as well as in other public statements. Mattel does not update forward-looking statements and expressly disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ynon.Story continuesYnon KreizThank you for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Mattel's second quarter financial results were in line with company expectations. But this moment in time will largely be remembered as a key milestone in our company's history, the release of our first-ever theatrical movie to a global audience as part of our strategy to expand our entertainment offering and capture the full value of our IP. We will talk more about the Barbie movie shortly. Turning to financials. Sales trends improved significantly from the first quarter but were down versus the prior year. This was primarily due to the continued impact of retailers managing inventory levels and industry softness as well as comparisons to the year ago quarter, which benefited from retailers building inventories earlier in the season. Looking at key financial metrics for the second quarter as compared to last year. Net sales declined 12% as reported or 13% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA declined $37 million to $148 million and trailing 12-month free cash flow increased by $214 million to $361 million. POS was down high single digits in the quarter and down low single digits for the first half of the year. POS continued to exceed shipping. Per Circana, in the second quarter and year-to-date, Mattel gained share globally and in our 3 leader categories, Dolls, Vehicles and Infant, Toddler and Preschool. Reflecting our strong financial position and confidence in our strategy, we continued to repurchase shares in the quarter, and we look to make further repurchases this year. Our retailers have made considerable progress in adjusting their inventories of Mattel products and are below prior year levels. While the toy industry declined more than we expected in the second quarter, we believe consumers are deferring purchases in anticipation of increased spending during the holiday season. However, given first half trends, we now expect the industry to decline modestly for the year, but remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We expect to outpace the industry, gain market share and are reiterating our full year guidance. Looking at gross billings in the quarter. Dolls and Vehicles grew while Infant, Toddler and Preschool and our Challenger categories declined. With respect to the Power Brands, Barbie and Fisher-Price declined, while Hot Wheels grew. The global rollout of Monster High and the launch of Disney Princess and Disney Frozen are building momentum. We continue to successfully execute our strategy to grow Mattel's IP-driven toy business and expand our entertainment offering in the second quarter. As it relates to our Toy business, we launched a wide range of Barbie movie-related toys and products. Releases to date have sold out across major distribution channels, and we will be expanding the range in the second half. We continue to expand our franchise brands with the launch of new innovative products, including Hot Wheels Racerverse, a new character-driven play system. We renewed our multi-category licensing partnership with Warner Bros. for their portfolio, including the DC Universe, Batwheels and Harry Potter, among others. As it relates to our entertainment business, the Barbie movie premiered globally last Friday to incredible success and became the largest opening weekend at the box office of 2023. This first production of Mattel Films brought together some of the world's most prolific filmmakers and talent of our generation. The world-class Barbie marketing organization and Mattel's broad expertise in demand creation in strong collaboration with Warner Bros. team promotional engine and global distribution platform have made the movie hard to ignore. The success of the box office during the first weekend combined with positive film reviews and the entire buildup towards its release made it more than a movie. It has become a cultural phenomenon. Exceptional media coverage and product tie-ins, cross-platform amplification from Warner Bros. Discovery cable and streaming services, a global philanthropic campaign and of course, a sellout toy line, significantly broadened the film's reach and fan engagement. We could not be prouder of the creative vision and execution of Greta Gerwig and are grateful for the partnership with Margot Robbie and LuckyChap Entertainment, Noah Baumbach, David Heyman, and of course, Warner Bros. commitment to the project from the very beginning. This would also not have been possible without the dedication of the Mattel Films and Barbie teams and everyone at Mattel, who have been a part of the Barbie movie. This is a milestone moment for Mattel in a showcase for the cultural resonance of our IP, our ability to attract and collaborate with top creative talent and the capabilities of our franchise management organization. This also speaks to the potential of Mattel Films and the significant progress of our strategy to capture the full value of our IP. We'll continue to make good progress in capturing value of our IP outside the toy aisle in other areas as well. As part of the Barbie movie, Mattel partnered with Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group to release the Barbie music album produced by Marc Ronson. The album features a stellar lineup of some of the most celebrated music artists in the world, including Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Sam Smith and other major global talent. Mattel also entered into over 165 consumer product partnerships tied to the Barbie movie with cross-category displays in thousands of stores globally. In television, the Barbie Dream House Challenge, a home makeover competition series hosted by Ashley Graham, premiered July 16 on HGTV to great success. The episode ranked as a top 5 cable premiere among women and adults 25 to 54 years old. The Hot Wheels Ultimate Challenge prime time show which premiered on NBC and Peacock on May 30, has performed well and ranks as a top NBC alternative series to launch on Peacock. In digital gaming, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, the upcoming sequel to the successful digital game for console and PC was announced. The game will launch this fall. And in live events, Mattel announced the Monster High live tour also coming this fall in partnership with the Family Entertainment Live. As we announced today, Richard Dickson, President and Chief Operating Officer, will step down from his position with the company effective August 3, 2023. I would like to thank Richard for his tremendous contributions to the company and congratulate him on his opportunity to become CEO of Gap Inc. Richard has led the growth of some of the world's most iconic and purpose-driven brands. I'm personally grateful for the friendship, the partnership and for his work in developing and growing the best brand and franchise team in the business today. We wish Richard great success in his new role. The company has promoted Lisa McKnight to Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer, overseeing all of Mattel's Toy categories and global brands as well as design and development. Josh Silverman has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Franchise Officer. His role has expanded to include leadership of digital gaming and license entertainment, in addition to his responsibilities overseeing global consumer products, publishing, promotions and location-based entertainment businesses as well as franchise strategy and management for Mattel. Lisa and Josh will report to me. The company has also promoted Chris Down to Executive Vice President and Chief Design Officer, reporting to Lisa. Lisa has held senior leadership positions at Mattel for nearly 25 years and has been the Global Head of Barbie since 2016 and Dolls since 2019. In this role, she has led the charge in repositioning and scaling the Barbie brand and driven significant portfolio expansion with complementary brands. She has also led the successful relaunch of Monster High and played a key role in winning back the licensing rights to Disney Princess and Disney Frozen franchises. Josh Silverman joined Mattel in 2022 as Global Head of Consumer Products and Chief Franchise Officer, following 20 years in leadership roles with The Walt Disney Company and Marvel. Since joining Mattel, he has expanded the company's consumer products, location-based entertainment and publishing businesses. Most notably, Josh oversaw the execution of more than 165 consumer products partnerships and retail tie-ins related to the Barbie movie. Our strong and talented leadership team and the entire brand management organization are in an excellent position to continue to execute our strategy to grow our IP-driven Toy business and expand our entertainment offering. In closing, our second quarter financial results were in line with expectations. But it was much more than that in terms of advancing our entertainment strategy. Following the incredibly successful Barbie movie release, we look forward to continue capitalizing on the many exciting opportunities to capture the full value of our iconic brands outside the toy aisle. We expect to achieve our full year guidance to outpace the industry and gain market share. We are well positioned to continue executing our multi-year strategy and create long-term shareholder value. And now I will turn the call over to Anthony.Anthony P. DiSilvestroThanks, Ynon. While comparisons improved from the first quarter, our second quarter financial results were negatively impacted as retailers continued to manage inventory levels compared to the buildup in the prior year. And while we gained share, we saw some overall industry softness. Net sales of $1.087 billion declined 12% or 13% in constant currency, compared to the prior year. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% was comparable to the prior year and a significant improvement from the first quarter comparison to the prior year. Adjusted operating income was $75 million, a decline of $47 million compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales. Adjusted EPS was $0.10 compared to $0.18 a year ago. And adjusted EBITDA of $148 million was $37 million below the prior year. We continue to expect consumer demand for Mattel product will be positive for the full year and revenue comparisons to improve in the second half as shipping patterns revert to historical trends. Given our first half performance and outlook for the balance of the year, we are reiterating our guidance, including for net sales growth in constant currency, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. Turning to gross billings in constant currency, first, by category. Overall, gross billings declined 12%, including a 2-point negative impact from Russia. Our POS in the quarter, which excludes Russia, declined by high single digits. That said, we continued to significantly outpace the industry and gain market share globally. Dolls grew 9%, driven by Disney Princess and Disney Frozen and the global rollout of Monster High, partly offset by Barbie. POS for Dolls declined mid-single digits, reflecting overall declines in the category. Barbie declined 7% with POS down low double digits. Barbie POS continued to be impacted by the shift of promotions to better align with the theatrical release of the movie. With the success of the Barbie movie and our robust marketing plans for the second half, we have seen improving trends with Barbie's month-to-date POS in July turning positive. Mattel outperformed the industry and gained over 400 basis points of market share in the Dolls category year-to-date. And Barbie was the #1 Doll property globally, per Circana. Vehicles continued its strong performance, growing 10%, in line with POS. Growth was primarily driven by Hot Wheels die-cast vehicles, which continue to perform well. Year-to-date, Mattel gained over 450 basis points of market share in the Vehicles category, achieving the highest first half share on record, per Circana. Infant, Toddler and Preschool declined 29%, reflecting the impact of retailer inventory movements and overall category weakness. POS was down low double digits, less than gross billings, primarily due to BabyGear as we continue to realign the business to more profitable segments. Mattel outperformed the category, gained 60 basis points of market share year-to-date and was the #1 toy company globally in the Infant, Toddler and Preschool category, per Circana. Challenger categories, in aggregate, declined 40% due primarily to lower sales and Action Figures as we lap the theatrical tie-ins in the prior year. POS declined low double digits, but ahead of gross billings. Regional performance was impacted by retail inventory headwinds in various markets as well as some industry softness in key regions. North America gross billings declined 18%, POS declined low double digits. For the first half, per Circana, Mattel gained market share in North America. EMEA declined 8%, reflecting a negative 8 percentage point impact from Russia. POS, excluding Russia, increased high single digits. Latin America grew 3% with POS comparable to the prior year. Per Circana, Mattel gained market share in Latin America year-to-date, extending our #1 market position. Asia Pacific increased 7% driven primarily by growth in China and India. POS declined low single digits. As previously discussed, retailer inventory levels were elevated heading into 2023. The position improved in the first quarter and has improved further this quarter. At the end of the second quarter, retailer inventory levels in dollars are below prior year levels by a double-digit percentage, with weeks of supply declining high single digits. At this point, we believe the retail inventory correction is mostly behind us. Adjusted gross margin of 44.9% in the quarter was comparable to the prior year. There were several puts and takes to this performance. On the positive side, price increases, primarily the carryover benefit from 2022 actions, contributed 170 basis points. Savings from the Optimizing for Growth program had a positive impact of 150 basis points, and foreign exchange had a positive benefit of 90 basis points. These positive factors were offset by cost inflation, while continuing to moderate, had a 140 basis point impact; fixed cost absorption of 100 basis points associated with lower volumes; inventory management costs, primarily closeout sales and obsolescence of 90 basis points; and mix and other factors of 80 basis points. Moving down the P&amp;L. Advertising expenses of $90 million were comparable to the prior year and up 100 basis points as a percentage of net sales. Looking ahead, we are planning for increased advertising spend in the second half. Adjusted SG&amp;A declined 6% to $324 million, primarily driven by our cost management efforts and savings from our Optimizing for Growth program. Adjusted operating income was $75 million compared to $121 million a year ago. The $47 million decline was due to lower sales partly offset by lower adjusted SG&amp;A. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $37 million to $148 million, impacted by the same factors. On a year-to-date basis, cash from operations, reflecting seasonality of the business was a use of $326 million compared to a use of $425 million in the prior year. The $99 million improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital performance, primarily inventories, partly offset by lower net income. Capital expenditures were $73 million compared to $79 million a year ago, and free cash flow was a use of $399 million compared to $503 million in the prior year. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $361 million in free cash flow compared to $147 million in the prior year, an increase of $214 million. The increase was primarily driven by cash from operations, benefiting from improved working capital performance, partly offset by higher capital expenditures supporting recent capacity additions. We have utilized a portion of our free cash flow to repurchase shares. In the first half, we repurchased $50 million of our shares and look to continue repurchases in the second half. Taking a look at the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a cash balance of $300 million compared to $275 million in the prior year. The increase reflects the free cash flow generated over the trailing 12 months, mostly offset by the use of cash to reduce debt and repurchase shares. Total debt declined to $2.328 billion from $2.576 billion last year, reflecting the repayment of $250 million of debt in the fourth quarter last year. Accounts receivable declined by $98 million to $891 million, broadly in line with the decline in sales. We continue to make good progress in reducing owned inventories. Inventory was $972 million compared to $1.178 billion in the prior year, a reduction of $206 million. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to achieve our targeted inventory reductions in 2023, which will contribute to free cash flow generation. Our leverage ratio increased to 3.1x at the end of the second quarter compared to 2.3x a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the timing of our quarterly results. We expect to end 2023 with a leverage ratio of approximately 2.5x. We generated $24 million of savings in the quarter as we continue to execute the Optimizing for Growth program launched in 2021. We remain on track to achieve our program savings goal of $300 million by 2023. Total estimated cash expenditures to implement the program are expected to be $155 million to $185 million. We are reiterating our full year 2023 guidance consistent with our first quarter earnings call. This includes our expectation for net sales to be comparable to last year in constant currency, adjusted EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.20, adjusted EBITDA of $900 million to $950 million and for free cash flow to exceed $400 million. We continue to expect growth in the Dolls and Vehicles categories, offset by declines in Infant, Toddler and Preschool and in our Challenger categories in aggregate. For our Power Brands, we expect Barbie and Hot Wheels to grow and for Fisher-Price to decline. At current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange translation will have a positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points on 2023 net sales. In terms of phasing and with the retailer inventory correction mostly behind us, we expect gross billings to return to historical trends with 2/3 of annual shipments in the second half. This will result in an accelerated growth rate, particularly in Q4, as we wrap an atypical retailer inventory decline in the prior year. We are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment with higher volatility that may impact consumer demand. The guidance considers what the company is aware of today, but remains subject to further market volatility, any unexpected disruption and other macroeconomic risks and uncertainties. In closing, Mattel's second quarter performance and first half was in line with expectations, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our full year guidance. The balance sheet is strong, and business fundamentals are sound. Retailer inventories are well positioned, and we look forward to meeting consumer demand for our products as we enter the second half of the year and the all-important holiday season. And now I will turn it over to the operator.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Your first question today comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH.Eric Owen HandlerSo in looking at Barbie and trying to sort of figure out the growth trajectory for this year, I wondered if you could talk about maybe give us some directional expectations and how much of the growth is from the toy aisle, how much is increased licensing and then maybe give us a hint on movie economics?Richard DicksonI'll start, it's Richard. Clearly on the Barbie front, we are incredibly pleased with the Barbie brand performance. I mean the success of the Barbie movie is a milestone moment for Mattel, and it really is a showcase for the cultural resonance of the brand. As we've seen, the success is far beyond the film. We've seen POS impacted on our toy business, on our consumer product partner business, which has really begun to accelerate meaningfully. We all see the world is playing with Barbie, whether it's our toys, fashion, accessories or content. I mean there's no doubt that the brand has reached a new level of cultural relevance. Tie-ins to date have been extraordinary with a movie soundtrack, television shows. We've announced over 165 different consumer product partnerships and live experiences. So all in all, it has been just a tremendous moment for the brand. And our guidance includes expectations for significant growth for Barbie in the second half and to be positive for the full year, certainly with the halo effect of the movie and its economics benefiting Mattel over the next several quarters and years. And ultimately, we've never been more confident in Barbie and our Dolls portfolio's future in both the back half and certainly years and beyond.Eric Owen HandlerOkay. Great. And by the way, Richard, congratulations well deserved, and good luck to you.Richard DicksonThank you.Eric Owen HandlerYnon, maybe you could talk a little bit about the big picture for what's next for the movie business. Does the success of Barbie make it easier to get other films that have been in the pipeline maybe greenlit and starting to move forward with -- I don't know -- I have no idea how far along scripts are or where they are in the process. But maybe you could talk a little bit about how to think about that, strike issues notwithstanding.Ynon KreizYes. So let's start by saying that from the beginning, this was not just about making a movie. This was about creating a cultural event and leverage our brands in a way that we've never done before. What we saw in this movie with this project and the way the Barbie movie was released and received in the marketplace, it was really a showcase for the cultural resonance of our brands, the way we work, attract and collaborate with top talent and our marketing and demand creation capabilities to create what effectively became a cultural phenomenon. So this is not just about releasing a movie, but really executing our strategy at the highest level. You've been following us for a while. This has been the strategy. This is what we were aiming to achieve. And it's great to see it playing out in that way in real time. We're not saying that every new movie will achieve the same level of success, but we absolutely plan to execute the same strategy, the same approach, the same methodology in collaborating with top talent in inspiring, in amplifying and trusting and promoting top talent and then bringing our marketing machine and demand creative capabilities to create special, iconic moments in culture. And yes, there is momentum right now overall, not just for Barbie, the brand, but for other brands. And of course, even on Barbie, this is not just about one movie. The goal was to create -- to build the film franchise and continue to extend the brand in more ways, and success breeds success. We believe we're in a very good place and hope to achieve more with Barbie and other brands.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserYes. So I'm just curious, in terms of this year needing to have -- the retailers needing to reduce inventory, did that affect the original plans for how big of a product line for Barbie related to the movie that you actually shipped into retail? I mean was that affected by the macro situation or not versus original plan?Anthony P. DiSilvestroNo. Linda, there are really 2 independent issues. In our original and our current guidance, we're anticipating a macro retail inventory impact of 3 to 4 percentage points. That continues to be our expectation. The movie toy line is kind of separate from that, and it's going very well.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And then -- can I just ask about -- it seems when you gave the shipment and the POS data for the outside the U.S., Latin America and Asia, it seemed like the shipment growth exceeded the POS growth. So I'm just curious, was that the retailers actually build -- rebuilding inventory? Or should we be concerned because the POS wasn't stronger in those markets?Anthony P. DiSilvestroWe feel good about the performance internationally. And I think in both Latin America and Asia Pacific, they didn't start with the retailer inventory situation that the other markets did. So we didn't expect to see that divergence, right, that we're seeing more in North America and EMEA where most that inventory correction actually has occurred. And sitting here at the end of Q2, we believe that the inventory correction is now mostly behind us, right? And this will bode well as we get into the second half with the expectation that will go back to those historical trends of 2/3 of gross billings happening in the second half, and that will certainly support an accelerated growth rate for us in H2.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And if I could just sneak in one more. So in terms of the Barbie movie, I think you said that in a couple of quarters or something, if the box office was really big, you would share in the economics and we might actually see it affect your earnings in a positive way. So I guess why -- given the success of the box office, why would that not be something that could make you raise your guidance for the year? Is it just not material enough?Anthony P. DiSilvestroYes. So in terms of the guidance, and as Ynon stated, the second quarter results were in line with company expectations. We are reiterating our guidance for net sales in constant currency to be comparable to 2022. And as I mentioned, this includes the retail inventory headwind of 3 to 4 points. And if you break down our guidance, it implies significant growth in the second half, including for Barbie, which we expect to be positive for the full year. That said, in the context of our overall portfolio, some industry softness we saw in Q2. And given it's still early in the year, we've got 2/3 of our sales still to go, we are maintaining our guidance. That said, we're off to a good start in Q3. Q3 quarter-to-date POS for the total company is now positive as well as for Barbie, and we continue to outpace the industry and to gain market share.Linda Ann Bolton-WeiserOkay. And let me slip in a congratulations to Richard. Good luck.Richard DicksonThank you, Linda, very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs.Stephen Neild LaszczykFirst on Barbie, Ynon. I was wondering if the success of the Barbie movie this past month has changed the way you look at capital allocation at all. Are there opportunities that you think make more sense today, perhaps committing more capital towards future media productions or acquiring other forms of IP that you think make more sense today than they may have a few months ago?Ynon KreizOkay. At this point, we're still absorbing and amplifying the initial rollout of the movie. It's early to comment on further plans. We're not changing strategy in the near term, but as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and drive more cash and see a significant increase in cash flow, we continue to look for ways to invest in organic growth, always in the interest of our shareholders. So whatever we do will be the most prudent and impactful way, risk-adjusted strategy to amplify return for our shareholders.Stephen Neild LaszczykGot it. And then maybe one for Anthony. You called out overall industry softness in your prepared remarks. I was hoping you can maybe unpack that a little bit more for us. What areas of the retail market are you seeing the most softness in? Looking ahead, I'm curious if there's anything you're hearing specifically from your retail partners that gives you confidence in achieving your top line guidance for the year? Any commentary around that would be helpful.Anthony P. DiSilvestroYes. So as we've said, we are seeing some industry softness. We believe that consumers are deferring some of their current purchases and intend to spend more in the second half and the holiday season. And that's why we're calling for a positive holiday season with the inventory correction now behind us, we're working closely with our retailers to meet the demand, the anticipated demand for our product in the second half. So we think we're in a very good position and look forward to the holiday season.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America.Jason Daniel HaasIt sounds like there's an incremental to -- I think you called out a 2 percentage point benefit from FX. So I guess my question is, why not raise the EPS guidance on the back of that? Is there anything that's incremental that's going to pressure EPS that wasn't contemplated in the guidance before?Anthony P. DiSilvestroSure. Look, inside of our gross margin, there are always kind of puts and takes. We had already anticipated some uplift from foreign exchange. Now we're quantifying it for you that based on current exchange rate, it's a 2-point positive to the top line, but there are other puts and takes. And at this point, we are reiterating the guidance, which is 47% on the year. And given our first half, that does imply significant gross margin in the second half, which will come from a number of factors, continued savings on our optimizing for growth program, the benefit of the top line. We're wrapping some onetime inventory management costs in Q4 of last year, and those all kind of factored in. So we feel good about where we are in the second half.Jason Daniel HaasThat's great. Are you able to give any color on what the cadence of revenue should look like between 3Q and 4Q? Will those also follow a normal seasonality?Anthony P. DiSilvestroYes. I think you'll see more of an acceleration in Q4 as we wrap the atypical inventory decline that happened in the fourth quarter of last year.Jason Daniel HaasGreat. And if I could squeeze one more in. Just on the Barbie movie, it sounds like things are off to a really good start. There's always this big question around this movie just because it's geared towards an older audience. The question was around how well the toy sales would do alongside it? So I know it's early, but is your initial -- the initial read that you are seeing those incremental toy sales alongside the movie? And then how about from the retailers? Are they seeing the success of the movie at the box office? And are they increasing their orders for Barbie at this point?Ynon KreizThe initial take-up in movie-related product has been selling out very fast. We've said that before. In terms of the actual toy brands and over 165 retail partnerships that we've had, so we've seen very strong success of that. We haven't commented yet on Barbie classic toys, which is what is factored into our full year guidance. But all in all, the -- we're clearly seeing a halo effect of the movie. But important to say that the -- this is not just about the quarter or about the year, this is about long-term franchise management. And we absolutely expect to see continued momentum with the brand on the back of such a strong initial release. And what is interesting to note is that with this move, we're seeing a real expansion in fan base, more male audience that go to the theaters. We're seeing very strong performance internationally. This is important to say because there was some commentary before the movie release that people thought it would be more successful domestically in the U.S., but we're actually seeing -- in spite of -- on top of the success in the U.S., we're seeing a very strong performance internationally, and this is before Japan even release, which will happen in August. So within the movie store, there are some very important indications about the strength of the brand, the take-up and the continued expansion of the fan base and audience overall.Jason Daniel HaasThat's great to hear. Congratulations on the success you've been having.Ynon KreizThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.Arpine KocharyanThis is Arpine. This is probably a question for Ynon. You are approaching peak production period, I believe, right around August. What goes into that thinking in terms of upside and downside to your plans? Buyers seem to be very cautious on inventory. At the same time, they are, in some cases, running below target in stock levels, at least in toys, yet not taking inventory. Do you see a risk that some of that cautious outlook that the retailer maintains sort of has the potential to be reflected in their purchase orders? How do you think about that?Ynon KreizThanks, Arpine. We continue to work collaboratively with our retail partners. This is what we do every year. This is what we do as we head towards the production season and all important holiday period. We continue to monitor the market. We receive input and data points from retailers all over the world, from our own people on the ground in every major market and look to continue to adjust and reflect that in how we map our plans going forward. The -- overall, the fundamentals are strong. The portfolio is very well balanced. We're seeing strength in -- not just in Barbie, but we talked about Hot Wheels a lot. Hot Wheels is on track to achieve its 6 record year. We have some important incremental drivers that we haven't had in past years, including Disney Princess and Frozen, Disney's Wish, Trolls. Monster High is rolling out globally. We've talked a lot about the Barbie movie. And that in itself will have its own potential momentum -- expected momentum. And of course, the continued strength across the portfolio. So we're not done. We look to continue to drive the business going forward. We just announced another partnership with Warner Bros. to grow our third-party licensing business as well. So we expect to continue to outpace the industry, gain market share and achieve our full year guidance.Arpine KocharyanThank you, Ynon. That is very helpful. And then would you be able to size, call it, meaningful consumer product partnerships be for your profitability over time? I think you said more than 160 partnerships for Barbie franchise alone. How should we think about the opportunity over time because, obviously, that can be a very high-margin business for you?Ynon KreizRight. You said it right. It's a very high-margin business. We continue to look at the Barbie movie as a template. We think of it as a template in terms of our ability to execute such comprehensive program of consumer product partnerships. And what is interesting in one of the takeaways of the success of the Barbie movie is our ability to execute our demand creation expertise outside the toy aisle. As a company, our focus to date has been doing that within the toy side of the business. And now we were able to take -- bring that expertise into amplifying the movie and turning it into a cultural event. Of course, it starts with having a great movie, reflecting the creative vision and masterful execution of a great picture by Greta Gerwig, having superstar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, having an amazing sound track that is now becoming an album and an experience in and of itself produced by Mark Ronson. But -- and of course, Warner Bros. in terms of their incredible marketing campaign and everything they brought to the table. But it is also very much about our expertise in amplifying all of that and turning it into a cultural event and continuing to drive business, important business outside of our core toy expertise.Arpine KocharyanGreat. And just really quickly for Fisher-Price. What are some of the underlying reasons the brand is still under so much pressure? How much of that decline is sort of clean up to shift to more profitable SKUs and get out of, for example, BabyGear, if you can quantify that quickly?Richard DicksonArpine, it's Richard. First off, Mattel outperformed the category. We gained 60 points -- basis points of market share year-to-date. We are the #1 toy company globally in the category of Infant, Toddler and Preschool. We did decline in the second quarter, but it really reflects the impact of retailer inventory movements and the overall category weakness, we continue to expect trends to improve as we progress through '23. We're supporting it by Imaginext, expanding its core audience with the release of Trolls later this year, which we're really excited about. We've got continued expansion of Little People that's gaining more and more momentum with our core brands, Barbie and Hot Wheels, which have extended into that property. We've got new strong innovation that is planned for the back half with great demand creation to support the brand. So there's a lot in the pipeline for Fisher-Price. Of course, we believe in the brand, its position in the market. The opportunity to grow. We'll continue to optimize the category that we're in, both in revenue and most importantly, profitability to extend our leadership position.Arpine KocharyanCongratulations on Barbie's success. And all the best to you, Richard.Richard DicksonThank you, Arpine.Ynon KreizThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research.Frederick Charles WightmanI just wanted to ask about the inventory correction time line. It seems like that got pushed out a little bit versus what you guys were expecting last quarter. So wondering what if anything changed? And then just how we should rationalize that with the gross margin impact that we saw? I mean, it was a pretty big sequential change in terms of what you called out that was tied to inventory closeouts. So how does that all work?Anthony P. DiSilvestroSure. I would say the retail inventory situation is unfolding as we expected, right? We made some progress in Q1. We made further progress in Q2. We ended the quarter with retail inventory levels down double-digit percent in dollars and a high single-digit percent as measured in weeks of supply. And we certainly had less inventory management costs in Q2 than we did in Q1. So as we sit here today, we would say that the correction is mostly behind us. And what that means looking ahead, as gross billings are expected to return normal patterns with 2/3 in the second half, we should see an accelerated growth rate, particularly in Q4 as we wrap last year's movement.Frederick Charles WightmanOkay. And then there was a comment about some of the POS impact in 2Q as far as consumer shifting spending to the holiday. What exactly has been informing that view? Is it tied to survey work? Or what are you sort of basing that on?Anthony P. DiSilvestroYes, it's based on our own internal research that we do every year in terms of talking to consumers and trying to understand how they're thinking, why they're making purchases or not making purchases. But I would also say -- I would also add to that. I think the economic data also supports what we're expecting in terms of -- consumer spending is expected to increase in the second half. Unemployment remains low. Inflation seems to be subsiding and consumer sentiment seems to be on the ride if you look at a number of indices as well.Frederick Charles WightmanMakes sense. All the best, Richard.Richard DicksonThank you so much.OperatorYour last question today comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.Andrew Edward CrumRichard, best of luck, and congrats. My first question is how does the current Hollywood labor disputes impact your business this year? Or is this something that if it lingers as more of a headwind in 2024?Ynon KreizWe -- it is delaying some projects that are in development, but we've made significant progress before the strike, and we expect to continue to make progress after the strike. We're watching the space, and we'll manage accordingly.Andrew Edward CrumOkay. And then, Ynon, I think you responded to a question concerning the entertainment strategy in light of the success you've had with Barbie to date. I wanted to drill down maybe a little bit further on that. Maybe it's a little bit premature to be asking this, but given the film hasn't been in release for more than a week, what are your thoughts around what's next for Barbie theatrically. Do you intend to sequel a film? Do you -- can you do spin-offs? Can you improve your participation or economics on the next project? What's next for Barbie?Ynon KreizWe haven't announced anything, and it's probably a bit early to talk about sequels. But obviously, with the success of the film with a phenomenal release less than a week already at well north of $400 million of box office and very strong momentum. And as I mentioned, repeat viewing and broad demographics, very strong global performance, that would invite more opportunities. We operate in an industry where everyone is looking for this moment for these brands, for these cultural events. And they don't -- they happen, but they don't happen often. So we're very proud to be the owners of such an important, iconic brand. We should remember that Barbie has been already successful before the movie, very -- the #1 brand for 2 years in a row, globally. And last year was #2 only behind Pokemon, but continuing to show strength on very strong footing. So we expect the brand to continue to grow. We expect to have more opportunities in content. And this is not just film, but also television and other areas where we continue to engage people who are -- have an emotional connection with the brand. And on this, I just want to make the point that the biggest shift in our strategy and in our DNA was to realize that people who buy our product are not just consumers, they are fans. And once you have an audience, the more opportunities open up to engage with your fans in many ways and continue to create value from that engagement. So expect more. Too early to talk about sequel specifically, but we absolutely believe there are more opportunities to continue to extend the Barbie brand.OperatorThis concludes our question and answers for today. I now turn the call back to Ynon Kreiz for closing remarks.Ynon KreizThank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, again, for your questions. Always a good discussion. I would like to close by congratulating the Barbie and Mattel Films teams and the entire global organization on the milestone moment we achieved together in bringing Barbie to life for the first time on the big screen in live action and advance our entertainment strategy. Congratulation again to Lisa McKnight, Josh Silverman and Chris Down in their well-deserved promotions. We look forward to their continued strong contributions to Mattel. And of course, thank you, Richard, for helping to make Mattel the company it is today. You will be missed. You're a friend, you're a personal friend to me. Your colleague will always stay friends, of course. We're going to miss you, but we wish you all the best in the new role, and thank you for everything you've done. And now I'll turn the call back to Dave.David ZbojniewiczThank you, Ynon, and thank you, everyone, for joining in today's call.

Few people, however, pause and consider that the same ecological fallout that is hurting communities is also taking a toll on the fossil fuel industry.Climate change is making it costlier for oil and gas companies to operate. Indeed, climate-related supply threats have already begun to manifest in the oil and gas industry, with more than 600 billion barrels equivalent of the world’s commercially recoverable oil and gas reserves, or 40% of total reserves,  facing high or extreme risks. According to UK-based global risk and strategic consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft, the risk of climate-related events disrupting the flow of oil to global markets is highest in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Nigeria.On a brighter note, a rapidly changing climate is creating numerous opportunities in sectors such as clean energy, water treatment and smart grids, among others. Here are 5 companies that are poised to benefit from global warming and climate change.1. Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.Market Cap: $14.9BYTD Returns: 21.9%Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) owns a portfolio of renewable power generating facilities primarily in North America. The company’s impressive portfolio of renewable energy assets has been helping the company maintain decent growth.With more money set to flow into the solar sector than the oil sector in the current year, renewable energy companies with large solar portfolios like Brookfield have been surging.In its latest results, Brookfield Renewable reported Q1 revenue of $1.33B (+16.7% Y/Y), beating the Wall Street consensus by $50M while Q1 FFO of $0.43 beat by $0.02. Better still, the company could continue to exceed expectations,""We acquired a scarce platform which we know well and remains well-positioned to continue to deliver returns within or above our target range. Based on our acquisition price for the remaining 50%, which we expect will deliver mid-to-high teen returns, our initial investment has generated an IRR of almost 30% and over two times invested capital in our three years of ownership,"" the company’s management said during its earnings call.Story continuesBEP is one of the few renewable energy companies that pay a dividend, with the yield currently at 4.5%.2. Energy Recovery Inc.Market Cap: $1.9BYTD Returns: 44.4%Energy Recovery Inc. (NASDAQ:ERII), together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and sells various solutions for the seawater reverse osmosis desalination and industrial wastewater treatment industries worldwide.ERII stock is trading at an all-time high after B. Riley Securities maintained its Buy rating and raised its price target to a Street-high $32 from $28, saying ""continued positive updates around CO2 refrigeration will be key for investor confidence in the opportunity, which appears to be quite real and compelling.""ERII is the only publicly traded company that is nearly 100% focused on desalination. Fortune Business Insights has projected that the global market size of water treatment will grow from $301.8 billion in 2022 to $489.1 billion in 2029, good for a 7.1% CAGR.3. Exxon Mobil CorpMarket Cap: $420.0BYTD Returns: -0.4%While trees and other plants naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, most climate change experts now agree that we are just not capable of planting enough, fast enough, to limit the damage to our ecosystems. Carbon capture is one technology that has been proposed to limit global warming and climate change. Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Energy Agency (IEA) consider carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) an ideal solution for many hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation, hydrogen production and cement from fossil fuels.Over the past few years, big oil firms have started investing heavily in CCUS, which some argue is simply Big Oil’s way of extending the life of oil and gas fields because captured carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). One such company is E&amp;P giant, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM). Back in April, Exxon CEO Darren Woods told investors that the company’s Low Carbon business has the potential to outperform its legacy oil and gas business within a decade and generate hundreds of billions in revenues. Woods outlined projections showing how the business has the potential to hit revenue of billions of dollars within the next five years; tens of billions in 5-10 years, and hundreds of billions after the initial 10-year ramp-up. However, whether Exxon is able to actualize its goal will depend on regulatory and policy support for carbon pricing, as well as the cost to abate greenhouse gas emissions, among other changes, Ammann said.Exxon believes that this will result in a ""much more stable, or less cyclical"" that is less prone to commodity price swings through predictable, long-term contracts with customers aiming to lower their own carbon footprint. For instance, Exxon recently signed a long-term contract with industrial gas company Linde Plc. (NYSE:LIN) that involves offtake of carbon dioxide associated with Linde’s planned clean hydrogen project in Beaumont, Texas.  Exxon will transport and permanently store as much as 2.2M metric tons/year of carbon dioxide each year from Linde’s plant. Back in February, Linde unveiled plans to build a $1.8B complex which will include autothermal reforming with carbon capture and a large air separation plant to supply clean hydrogen and nitrogen.4. Schlumberger Ltd Market Cap: $79.8BYTD Returns: 9.6%Just like its bigger peer, oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE:SLB) is betting big on carbon capture. Back in February, oil field services giant Schlumberger discussed its newly carved SLB New Energy unit with Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). According to SLB New Energy president Gavin Rennick, the unit is expected to hit revenue of $3 billion by the end of the current decade and at least $10 billion by the end of the next decade. SLB will focus on five key niches, each with a minimum addressable market of $10 billion.:•Carbon solutions•Hydrogen•Geothermal and geoenergy•Energy storage•Critical mineralsOf these segments, Rennick says carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) is the fastest growing opportunity thanks to the significant boost it got from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).5. Occidental Petroleum Corp.Market Cap: $54.2BYTD Returns: 2.6%To achieve our climate goal, McKinsey has proposed the creation of CCUS hubs, essentially a cluster of facilities that share the same CO2 transportation and storage or utilization infrastructure. Currently, there are only 15 CCUS hubs across the globe; McKinsey estimates that there’s the potential to build as many as 700 CCUS hubs globally, located on, or close to, potential storage locations and Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery (EOR/EGR) sites.The U.S. government is currently backing four hubs, with two major Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s (NYSE:OXY) projects seen as strong contenders. The government is offering three levels of funding, ranging from $3 million for early stage feasibility studies to $12.5 million for engineering design studies to up to $500 million for projects ready to complete the procurement, construction and operation phases.Swiss start-up Climeworks, which has raised more than $800 million to date, is among the most active CCUS firms so far.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Oil Prices Rise As Focus Returns To Supply TightnessSaudi Arabia’s Oil Revenues Slump To The Lowest Level Since 2021Bullish Sentiment Slowly Builds In Oil MarketsRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks Under $30. It is evident that the market follows various investment patterns, where one strategy may outperform the other depending on shifts in investor sentiment. At the beginning of 2023, there was a resurgence in interest in AI stocks, overshadowing the previously favored dividend equities. However, the situation is about to change. Following the Federal Reserve's recent announcement about possible interest rate increases, investors are once again turning their attention to dividend-paying stocks as a means of generating cash.According to Refinitiv Lipper, dividend-paying stocks are experiencing investor interest as the $11.7 billion ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This marked the ETF's highest two-week gain since January. The fund tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more and has returned 7.5% so far this year. Fund managers are also giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks this year. In a recent poll conducted by BoFA Global Research, 44% of global fund managers expressed their expectation that high-dividend stocks would outperform low-dividend stocks. This figure indicates a significant nine-percentage-point increase compared to the previous month.Jurrien Timmer, a director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has now shifted his focus more toward financial and energy stocks. He believes that both sectors will experience positive outcomes due to what he anticipates will be an economic soft landing, avoiding a severe recession. Both the sectors are also showing a stable performance. This month, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector has risen by 5.7%, while the financials sector has increased by 5.6%. In comparison, the broader index has only gained 2.5%. In addition to this, the energy sector has paid steady dividends to shareholders over the past years. In one of our articles on dividend stocks, we reported that dividends in the energy sector have experienced significant growth, increasing by 401% since 2018. In contrast, the rest of the US market saw a dividend growth of 86% during the same period.Story continuesAlso read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $25Though growth in dividend payouts has slowed in 2023, investors are turning to dividend-paying stocks as a means of achieving a total return. They expect that bond yields might weaken, while stocks are expected to perform well. Historical analysis demonstrates the importance of dividends in generating returns and making money. For instance, from 1993 through the end of 2022, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 777%. Yet, when dividends were included, the S&amp;P 500's total growth during that period surpassed 1,400%.

131,b1d1f81f-4fb2-3be8-b951-06a25df6be9a,AMGN,2023-07-28,Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-nasdaq-amgn-seems-debt-120046630.html,1690545646,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen What Is Amgen's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of March 2023, Amgen had US$61.6b of debt, up from US$36.9b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$31.6b in cash leading to net debt of about US$30.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Amgen's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.2b due within a year, and liabilities of US$69.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.6b and US$5.74b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$46.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This deficit isn't so bad because Amgen is worth a massive US$125.7b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Amgen has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Importantly Amgen's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amgen's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amgen recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 91% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Amgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For instance it seems like it has to struggle a bit handle its debt, based on its EBITDA,. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Amgen is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

ABBV reported adjusted earnings of $2.91 per share for second-quarter 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79. The reported earnings also exceeded the guidance of $2.75-$2.85. However, earnings declined 13.6% year over year.ABBV’s revenues of $13.87 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.52 billion. Sales declined 4.9% year over year on a reported basis and 4.2% on an operational basis. The downside was caused by lower sales of Humira, Imbruvica and Eye care products, which was partially offset by the rise in product sales of key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Botox and Vraylar.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales decline of 24.8% to $4.01 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States declined 26.0% to $3.45 billion, while ex-U.S. market sales were down 17.0% on an operational basis to $560 million. The drug’s sales beatthe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates that were pegged at $3.93 billion and $3.95 billion, respectively.This substantial decline in Humira sales was due to the drug’s recent loss of exclusivity in the United States. Earlier this January, Amgen AMGN announced the launch of the first Humira biosimilar in the United States, called Amjevita.Like Amgen, several other companies like Boehringer Ingelheim, Coherus BioSciences and Novartis NVS have also started marketing their own Humira biosimilars since the onset of this month. Novartis, through its generic division Sandoz, markets its Humira biosimilar under the trade name Hyrimoz. Like Amgen and Novartis, more generic drugmakers are planning to launch their own Humira biosimilars throughout this year. These subsequent launches are expected to erode Humira’s sales in subsequent quarters. The drug lost the exclusivity in ex-U.S. territories following the launch of generics in 2018.Story continuesNet revenues from Rinvoq in the second quarter were $918 million, up 56.7% on an operational basis year over year. The upside can be attributed to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in recent quarters. Rinvoq sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $896 million and $878 million, respectively.Net revenues recorded from Skyrizi in the second quarter were $1.88 billion, up 51.0% on an operational basis year over year. This uptick in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the recent quarters. Skyrizi sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.77 billion and $1.76 billion, respectively.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 14.2% on an operational basis to $1.89 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar. The new migraine drug Qulipta also contributed to sales growth. Neuroscience sales figures beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.82 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 11.3% to $748 million, sales of Vraylar increased 33.9% to $658 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy were $196 million, up 6.0% year over year.The recently-launched Qulipta generated $96 million in product revenues compared with $66 million in first-quarter 2023.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 9.8% on an operational basis to $1.48 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower sales of Imbruvica. The oncology/hematology sales figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.43 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively.Second-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $907 million, down 20.8% year over year. AbbVie markets the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $666 million, down 22.8% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug declined 14.7% to $241 million.AbbVie’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $571 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 15.0% year-over-year growth.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were up 2.9% on an operational basis to $1.38 billion, driven by rising Juvederm product sales. Sales of Juvederm rose 9.7% on an operational basis to $368 million, while Botox Cosmetic sales increased 0.7% on an operational basis to $685 million.Eye care portfolio sales declined 12.3% on an operational basis to $617 million. Sales of Ozurdex, a key drug in the portfolio, rose 10.2% year over year to $119 million.Cost DiscussionAdjusted SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.0% to $3.22 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.73 billion in the second quarter, up 7.7% year over year. The adjusted operating margin contributed 47.0% to sales.Raises 2023 GuidanceAbbVie raised its earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance for 2023. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.90-$11.10, up from the previously-provided EPS guidance of $10.57-$10.97.Our TakeAbbVie’s second-quarter results were better than expected, with the top and the bottom line beating the consensus mark. The company also raised its EPS guidance for 2023. Shares rose 2.1% in pre-market trading on Jul 27 attributable to this guidance raise.Year to date, AbbVie’s shares have lost 12.2% against the industry’s 1.8% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the presence of Amgen’s Amjevita in first-half 2023, Humira sales beat both our model and consensus estimates. This reflected on a slower conversion to the Amgen biosimilar. However, we expect this conversion to accelerate as more Humira biosimilars are launched. This month alone, at least five Humira biosimilars were launched by Boehringer Ingelheim, Samsung Bioepis, Biocon, Coherus BioSciences and Novartis. The number of biosimilars is only expected to rise going forward.AbbVie’s newer immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been launched across Humira's major indications and a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis, have to some extent succeeded in making up for lost Humira sales. The company’s neuroscience products have also been showing robust performance, being driven by sales of the recently approved migraine drugs, Qulipta and Ubrelvy.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc.

(NYSE American, TSX: NG) (“NOVAGOLD” or “the Company”) received $25 million from Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NGT) (“Newmont”) as per the 2018 Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) in which NOVAGOLD sold its 50% interest in the Galore Creek project (“GCP”) in British Columbia, Canada. All amounts are in U.S. dollars.Under the terms of the Agreement1, total consideration payable by Newmont was up to $275 million. NOVAGOLD received $100 million upon closing, $75 million in July 2021 and this most recent receipt of $25 million.The latest payment from Newmont increased NOVAGOLD’s cash position by $25 million, which consisted of approximately $109 million of cash and term deposits as of May 31, 2023. As a result of the successful sale of the GCP, NOVAGOLD materially increased its treasury, providing the Company with a strong financial foundation to advance its 50%-owned Donlin Gold project in Alaska.About NOVAGOLDNOVAGOLD is a well-financed precious metals company focused on the development of its 50%-owned Donlin Gold project in Alaska, one of the safest mining jurisdictions in the world. With approximately 39 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource categories, inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (541 million tonnes at an average grade of approximately 2.24 grams per tonne, in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories on a 100% basis)2, the Donlin Gold project is regarded to be one of the largest, highest-grade, and most prospective known open-pit gold deposits in the world. According to the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report, both as defined below3, once in production, the Donlin Gold project is expected to produce an average of more than one million ounces per year over a 27-year mine life on a 100% basis. The Donlin Gold project has substantial exploration potential beyond the designed footprint of the open pit which currently covers three kilometers of an approximately eight-kilometer-long gold-bearing trend. Current activities at the Donlin Gold project are focused on state permitting, engineering studies, community outreach, and workforce development in preparation for the eventual construction and operation of this project. With a strong balance sheet, NOVAGOLD is well-positioned to fund its share of permitting and advancement efforts at the Donlin Gold project.Story continuesScientific and Technical InformationCertain scientific and technical information contained herein with respect to the Donlin Gold project is derived from the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report3.

Donlin Gold possesses Proven Reserves of approximately 8 Mt grading 2.32 g/t and Probable Reserves of approximately 497 Mt grading 2.08 g/t, each on a 100% basis, of which approximately 4 Mt of Proven Reserves and approximately 249 Mt of Probable Reserves is attributable to NOVAGOLD. Mineral Reserves and Resources have been estimated in accordance with NI 43-101 and S-K 1300.3 The Company retained Wood Canada Limited (“Wood”) in 2020 to update content in its previously filed “Donlin Creek Gold Project, Alaska, USA, NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Second Updated Feasibility Study,” effective November 18, 2011, and amended January 20, 2012. This update resulted in a report titled “NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA” with an effective date of June 1, 2021 (the “2021 Technical Report”) and was filed on August 31, 2021. The Company is a registrant with the SEC and is reporting its exploration results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves in accordance with S-K 1300 as of November 30, 2021. While the S-K 1300 rules are similar to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects rules in Canada, they are not identical and therefore two reports have been produced for the Donlin Gold project. The Company requested that Wood prepare a Technical Report Summary of the Donlin Gold project, Alaska, USA using the standards of S-K 1300 and it is titled “S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA” (“S-K 1300 Report”) dated November 30, 2021. Wood incorporated 2020 costs and new gold price guidance to meet the Company’s reporting requirements. The resultant 2021 Technical Report and S-K 1300 Report showed no material change to the previously reported mineral resources or mineral reserves.]"

On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.Phebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time Board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segments, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace.Story continuesWhile revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year’s second quarter. So, we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year’s first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes.As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.Jason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the Company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter.We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace and Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months.Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year.That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There’s no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we’d expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter.Photo by NASA on UnsplashIn fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter, in fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory. Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business.In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they’ve seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified. Now, let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023.Phebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now, let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year’s second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation’s completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency.In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work. Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year’s second quarter as a result of a 60 basis-point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&amp;D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins. Moving to the demand environment.Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree. The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is a flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan.When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I’ll have more on this later in my remarks.Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year-ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis-point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So, we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin, in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis-point reduction in margin for the reasons described.Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So, a very exciting first half for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis-point decrement in operating margin.We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis-point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So, a good quarter and first half. So, let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I’m about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won’t repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity.So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So, we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you.Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same.One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the Company that he intends to retire later this year. So, this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.Howard Rubel: Thank you for your kind words and friendship. It’s been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community these nearly six years. I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today, I want to say thank you. Now, let’s turn to the question-and-answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?See also 11 Best TSX Stocks To Buy Right Now and 13 Most Promising Robotics Stocks According to Analysts.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. (Operator Instructions)I will now turn the call over to Renee Benedict, Director, Investor Relations and FP&amp;A. You may begin.Renee BenedictThank you, Michelle, and good morning. Welcome to Masco Corporation's 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Keith Allman, President and CEO of Masco; and David Chaika, Masco's Interim Chief Financial Officer.Our second quarter earnings release and the presentation slides are available on our website under Investor Relations. Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions. (Operator Instructions) If we can't take your question now, please call me directly at (313) 792-5500.Our statements today will include our views about our future performance, which constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Our statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Our references to operating profit and earnings per share will be as adjusted, unless otherwise noted. We reconcile these adjusted metrics to GAAP in our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website under Investor Relations. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Keith.Story continuesKeith J. AllmanThank you, Renee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.Please turn to Slide 5. I'm pleased with our performance in the first half of the year. We have demonstrated the resiliency of our business and our ability to mitigate the impacts of volatile market conditions, while maintaining our focus on growth, productivity and shareholder returns.In the second quarter, our top line decreased 10% against a strong 8% comp. Volume was down 12%, partially offset by pricing actions of 4%. While sales were down $225 million, our operating profit only declined $10 million due to strong cost recovery and improved operational efficiencies. This solid execution resulted in operating profit margin expansion of 140 basis points and a decremental margin of only 4%. In addition, our earnings per share for the quarter grew 3% to $1.19.I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and continued efforts to execute on our strategic initiatives and deliver strong results.Turning to our segments. Plumbing sales declined 10% in local currency, with North American and international Plumbing declining 12% and 8%, respectively. In North American Plumbing, demand trends continue to be soft across channels and product categories. In international Plumbing, as expected, the slowing demand we began to see in Europe and China in the first quarter continued into the second quarter. We continue to expect our international plumbing market to be down high single digits for the full year.Despite the top line decline, our Plumbing margin expanded 270 basis points to 20% in the second quarter. This strong margin performance was driven by pricing actions taken to recover the significant inflation we have experienced as well as improvements in operational efficiencies, particularly in our North American Plumbing business. We are focused on driving our operating profit margins back to at least the 2019 level of 18% over time, and I'm pleased with the progress we are making in the Plumbing segment.We also executed on our bolt-on acquisition strategy by entering into an agreement to acquire Sauna360, a leader in the sauna, steam and infrared wellness industry. This acquisition complements our spa business, expands our wellness product offerings and leverages Watkins expansive dealer network. We expect this transaction to close in the third quarter.Lastly, in Plumbing, we are pleased that Delta Faucet was named Showroom Partner of the Year by one of our large plumbing wholesale customers, demonstrating the value we provide to our customers and our strength in the wholesale plumbing channel.Turning to our Decorative Architectural segment, sales declined 8% in the quarter against a strong 15% comp. PRO paint declined mid-single digits against a robust comp of approximately 40% in the second quarter of 2022. DIY paint sales declined low single digits against a strong low teens comp.During the first half of the year, we secured additional shelf space in adjacent product categories, launched new products and invested in our PRO paint business. This demonstrates the strength of our Behr brand, quality of our products and our commitment to exceptional service performance. Our over 40-year relationship with our paint partner, The Home Depot, is extremely strong. And we believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow share together in the PRO paint market.We're also excited to announce that we will begin distributing products from our new paint distribution and manufacturing facility located in Central Ohio in early September, and we expect to begin producing paint in the new facility in the first quarter of next year. This new facility enables our paint business to continue to provide superior levels of service expected of us and the capacity to accommodate the growth we expect in this business.Turning to capital allocation. We continue to generate strong free cash flow during the quarter and maintain a solid balance sheet. As a result, we executed on our balanced capital deployment strategy and returned $89 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including buying back 500,000 shares for $25 million in the quarter.With the pending acquisition of Sauna360 for approximately EUR 125 million, our share repurchases for the year will be approximately $350 million.Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As a result of our strong execution during the first half of the year, we now anticipate earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.65 per share, up from our previous guidance of $3.10 to $3.40. In this uncertain environment, we remain focused on closely managing costs, minimizing the impact of lower volumes and driving our margins back to 2019 levels. We will continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and people to outperform the competition and deliver returns for investors, both in the near and long term.We believe we're well positioned to weather the challenging near-term demand environment and have strong long-term fundamentals in our repair and remodel markets. Structural factors such as high home equity levels, the age of housing stock and a homeowner staying in their homes longer, will drive increased repair and remodel activity in several ways. Home equity levels, which are highly correlated to repair and remodeling, remain at record levels due to rapid home price appreciation and can withstand significant pullbacks in home prices and still be above 2019 levels.Also, 1.8 million more single-family homes will reach the prime remodeling ages of 20 to 39 years old through 2027. Households with homes in this prime remodeling age tend to have above-average income and home values, which supports the likelihood of investing in remodeling projects.In addition, many homeowners have taken advantage of low mortgage rates and are likely to remain in their homes longer. And with record levels of equity, these homeowners are more willing to take on larger modeling projects to update their homes. All of these structural forces provide tailwinds for our business and increase our confidence for a strong repair and remodel market after 2023 when the economy stabilizes.With favorable fundamentals for our portfolio and continued successful execution of our growth strategy, along with our strong free cash flow and disciplined capital deployment, we are well positioned to drive shareholder value creation for the long term.Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to update you on our CFO search. As I mentioned last quarter, we have strong internal candidates, and our search firm has delivered strong external candidates as well. We are in the final stages of the selection process and anticipate naming our CFO shortly.Now I'll turn the call over to Dave to go over our second quarter results and 2023 outlook in more detail. Dave?David A. ChaikaThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Renee mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other onetime items.Turning to Slide 7. Sales in the quarter decreased 10%, and excluding currency, decreased 9%. Lower volumes decreased sales by 12%, partially offset by net selling price increases of 4%. North American sales decreased 10%, and in local currency, international sales decreased 8%.Despite the sales decline, we executed well in the quarter, and our focus on operational efficiency helped drive gross margin expansion of 320 basis points to 36.2%. Our SG&amp;A as a percent of sales was 17.2%. Operating profit in the second quarter was $404 million, down only $10 million year-over-year. And operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 19%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes, mostly offset by higher net selling prices. Lastly, our EPS in the quarter increased 3% to $1.19 per share.Turning to Slide 8. Plumbing sales in the quarter decreased 11%, and excluding currency, decreased 10%. Lower volume and mix decreased sales by 15%, partially offset by net selling prices, which increased sales by 4%. North American Plumbing sales decreased 12% in local currency. Our wholesale Plumbing channel performed well in the quarter, offset by softness in retail and spas. Our spa business declined over 20% against a strong 35% comp.International Plumbing sales decreased 8% in local currency against an 11% comp as demand continued to soften in many European markets and China. We also began to see a small negative mix impact in international Plumbing, which we expect will increase in the second half of the year as the international markets will likely slow further.Segment operating profit in the second quarter was $245 million, up $7 million year-over-year, and operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 20%. Operating profit improvement was driven by net selling price increases and continued improved operational efficiencies, partially offset by lower volumes.Turning to Slide 9. Decorative Architectural sales decreased 8% for the second quarter against a strong 15% comp. Paint sales declined mid-single digits with PRO paint sales decreasing mid-single digits against a robust comp of approximately 40% in the second quarter of 2022. On a 2-year stack basis, our PRO paint comp is up over 30%, demonstrating the significant share we have gained over the past 2 years.Operating profit was $180 million, and operating margin was 20%. Operating profit was impacted by lower volumes, higher input costs and growth investments, partially offset by higher net selling prices. We've now anniversary-ed most selling price increases, so price increases will have little impact on the second half of 2023 for this segment.With respect to input costs for paint, we experienced raw material inflation in the first half of the year, and our overall cost basket remains elevated. We are starting to see relief in certain paint input costs and expect modest low single-digit deflation in the second half of the year on these raw materials. For the full year, we continue to anticipate low single-digit inflation for our paint raw material basket.Turning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.8x at quarter end. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of balance sheet liquidity. Working capital as a percent of sales was 18.9%, which matched prior year, though net working capital days improved by 9 days. With expected lower volumes and fewer supply chain disruptions this year, we anticipate working capital as a percent of sales to continue to improve and be approximately 16.5% at year-end compared to 17.4% in 2022.During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares for $25 million. We continue to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy and anticipate deploying approximately $500 million to share repurchases and acquisitions for the full year. With the pending acquisition of Sauna360 for approximately EUR 125 million, we expect to deploy up to $350 million for share repurchases for the full year.Now let's turn to Slide 11 for our updated outlook for the year. For Masco overall, our top line is developing largely as expected, and we still expect sales to decline approximately 10%. However, with our strong first half execution and margin performance, we now expect full year margins to be approximately 16%, increased from our previous guide of approximately 15%.In our Plumbing segment, we expect 2023 sales to be down in the range of 10% to 12%, narrowed from our previous expectation of down 10% to 14%. We now anticipate the full year Plumbing margins will be approximately 17%, increased from our previous guide of approximately 16%.In our Decorative Architectural segment, we expect 2023 sales to be down in the range of 8% to 10%, narrowed from our previous range of down 5% to 10%. We anticipate the full year Decorative Architectural margin to be approximately 17%, increased from our previous guidance of approximately 16%.Finally, as Keith mentioned earlier, thanks to our strong execution, our 2023 EPS estimate is now $3.50 to $3.65 per share, up from our previous guide of $3.10 to $3.40. This assumes a 226 million average diluted share count for the year and a 24% effective tax rate. Additional modeling assumptions for 2023 can be found on Slide 14 of our earnings deck.With that, I'd like to open the call for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from John Lovallo of UBS.John LovalloThe first one here is it looks like the improved 2023 outlook is really driven by the outperformance in the second quarter with the second half expectations seem to be unchanged. This seems a little bit conservative given the magnitude of the beat in the second quarter. I know you called out, Keith, that maybe some incremental softening in Europe. But just curious, more broadly, what you're seeing that kind of keeps you a little bit more on the conservative side.Keith J. AllmanWell, clearly, John, volume is the main driver, and we're seeing a consistent performance in North America, if you will, in terms of against our expectations. We did expect to see somewhat of an increase, if you will, in the slowdown in Europe, and we did see that. So while our first quarter in Europe, I think it was down 3%, we expected that to accelerate as we saw that Europe was lagging a little bit in demand, and that has come to fruition.So when we think about our overall guidance, I divided it into a couple of pieces. One, in terms of the overall top line, as expected, it's coming in as we anticipated. So no real change there. I would tell you that our performance and our execution was stronger than expected. And so we had better margin performance coming through in the first half. And so that, I would say, John, are the components of it. We kind of -- as expected on the top line, and a little bit better than expected in terms of our performance.David A. ChaikaJohn, I'd just add to that, similarly, we do expect continued pressure on volumes in the back half of the year that will weigh on margins as well as additional growth investments. We also have very strong price cost realization in the first half that will, as we lap most of our price increases, will diminish in the second half. So that's why our second half looks a little more conservative compared to what we put up in the first half.John LovalloUnderstood. That's a good segue into my second question. Maybe it sounds like you are anniversary-ing most of the price increases. How are you thinking about incremental pricing opportunities across segments as we move into the back half?Keith J. AllmanWell, that obviously depends on where commodities go. And I think we've demonstrated across our business the ability to get price, thanks to our strong brands, our innovation pipelines, how we service our channels and the value we bring to the consumer. So it really depends on where the costs go. I think when we look at where we've gotten our price, we've gotten this year, I think over the last couple of years, we've gotten in the range of 12% pricing. So pretty significant, obviously, price over the last couple of years. This year already, we've gotten some in spots and certain categories in plumbing where we had to catch up. We've gotten some additional pricing. We've demonstrated price cost neutrality in decorative over time, and we expect that to continue. But really, in terms of the outlook for pricing as we go forward, will depend on where commodities go.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautMaybe just to circle back to the prior question, perhaps trying to get a finer point on it. In terms of the guidance and what looks like effectively a reiteration of the back half outlook, in the second quarter and I think for the year overall, the top line doesn't look like it -- the top line outlook doesn't look like it's changed that much. You did have great margin performance in the second quarter though. And it looks like effectively, you're not necessarily expecting that better-than-expected margin performance to continue into the back half. So I'm just trying to understand, number one, if that's correct.And number two, specifically on the margin side, and I understand your outlook on the top line remains relatively unchanged, but what perhaps is different about what you were able to achieve in the second quarter given that the sales more or less came in line with expectations that might not follow through fully into the back half in terms of the better-than-expected margin performance?Keith J. AllmanI'd point to 3 things, Mike. Firstly, as Dave mentioned in the last question, we do expect to continue to have top line volume pressures as we go forward. As expected, Europe has softened, and we continue to see the steady, if you will, softness in North America. So volume is the biggest driver of it.Secondly, we enjoyed year-over-year pricing benefit in the first half, and that will fairly quickly go away as we get into the second half and lap the biggest chunks of the price increases that we came -- that we put in, in 2022. So that lapping at the price is a big factor.And then thirdly, as we've consistently talked about, we're going to continue to invest in our business. Now we're making and watching our spend very carefully, but we're committed to investing to win in the recovery and to continue to gain share when we have some of these challenging top line areas. So investing in our Plumbing business and making sure that we have our capacity in the right spot with regards to our European plant that's coming online and investing in our Decorative Architectural business with regards to continuing to build capabilities and to continue to drive above-market growth in PRO paint, getting our capacity right with our new facility in Central Ohio. And as I said, we're starting to distribute out of that. And shortly, we'll be manufacturing liquids and paint out of that building.So we're continuing to invest in our business, and that's some incremental headwinds as we look forward. So those are the 3 main drivers with, for sure, volume being the main one.David A. ChaikaMike, it's Dave. I'll just add to that. We also are bringing online our European Plumbing manufacturing plant. That will be a little bit of headwind here in the second half as well. And then also, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, the negative mix impact we're seeing in international is probably a little greater than we originally viewed coming into the year, which accounts for again the second half be a little bit softer.Michael Jason RehautOkay. No, no, that's helpful. I appreciate that extra color, I guess, there.Secondly, maybe just to shift to the paint segment. The performance in PRO, in particular, is impressive given the strength of the year-ago comp. And I was hoping maybe that kind of -- maybe take a step back and giving the overview in terms of where you are. I think you've kind of noted that following the move last year, the PRO paint business is around $900 million, I think, in 2022, maybe it's a little bit less this year. But just where you think the opportunities are going forward for that business? And if you could remind us if that's a similar margin business as DIY or maybe a little bit above and how you see the relative growth opportunity there?Keith J. AllmanMichael, I think the opportunity is to continue to drive full loyalty. That's a loyal group. And over the past 3 years, we have gained significant confidence and, of course, significant share when you look at our growth versus the market. So we very closely monitor customer experience with our product.And it's clear when we look at Net Promoter Scores and other metrics that they're very satisfied with the switch that they have made to either greater share of wallet or trying Behr for the first time. So it's really about continuing to stay focused, as we have, frankly, for the last decade on improving month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, our capabilities in the service and generating greater loyalty.So things like buy online and pick up in store, an expansion of our delivery options, our PRO outside sales force, continuing to figure out ways that we can work more closely together with the folks at The Home Depot to drive better loyalty, enhancing our actual loyalty programs, so things of that nature. Our capacity is also a component of that as we saw when we're able to provide outstanding delivery in spite of what happens in the supply chain, that's a big plus for us. And so that's part and parcel of the rationale for our new plant in Ohio. So enhancing our services, identifying new capabilities, focus on the PRO, strengthening our relationship every day with The Home Depot, that's really the story.David A. ChaikaAnd Mike, on the margin front, it is a little bit lower margin than our core business because we do have additional resources behind it, mainly additional people and PRO sales reps, both outside the store and inside the store to provide the level of service that the PRO painter demands as well as additional loyalty programs that Keith mentioned. So it is a little bit of a lower-margin business, but still very good margin. And as we continue to grow that, we'd expect that gap to close.OperatorThe next question comes from Stephen Kim, Evercore.Stephen KimWondering if I could follow up here a little bit on the price/cost commentary. It sounds like you saw some benefit this quarter in terms of price/cost. I'm curious as to whether or not you're including an improving outlook for price/cost in your margins forecast for Plumbing. And in general, are you still expecting to see a return to market growth in late 2023? If you could just sort of update us on your market outlook, particularly as it relates to Plumbing.Keith J. AllmanI'll take that last part first, Stephen. We're not going to be offering up, at this point, our view on 2024. But we do believe that this is a relatively short-term dip and that this recovery will happen more sooner than later, but we're not going to get into specifics of 2023 at this point.In terms of your question on price/cost benefit, are you really asking a question regarding our view on commodities?Stephen KimReally more like just the net of price and cost in the Plumbing segment. I think you already talked about the anniversary-ing pricing in Dec Arch. But within Plumbing, I'm curious broadly for the segment, is your outlook for margins in the back half in plumbing informed by an improving view of net price/cost?Keith J. AllmanWe're going to lap the majority of our prices in the back half of the year. So we have, certainly, have seen an improvement in the first half. And we'll be netting the -- or lapping the majority of our price increases that we've given in really coming here in the third quarter, soon in the third quarter. And then we had another -- a couple of incremental price increases late in the year. So we'll have a little bit of net impact. But that -- the impact of price/cost is going to certainly be less in the second half.Stephen KimOkay. That's helpful. And then second question, still staying with Plumbing, you talked about mix effect. I think it was relegated to -- your comments were relegated to international at this point. My recollection is that last quarter, you actually also started to see a little bit of mix impact, negative mix effect in plumbing. So I'm curious if you could provide a little bit more detail around what you're seeing. Did it intensify -- is it intensifying in international? Is it spreading in any way into North America as well? And is there any kind of margin impact that we should anticipate as a result from negative mix shift in plumbing?David A. ChaikaStephen, it's Dave. I'll take that one. On the negative mix in international, it's really a function of countries. Our core European markets, which tend to be a higher price point products, are softening a little bit more than some of our international markets. So we have more of a geographic mix impact. It might have a little bit of trade down that we're seeing in our core European markets, but for the most part, it's more of the geographic impact on the international side.Here domestically, we're not seeing a lot of trade down. We have a little bit of mix impact in the segment from our spa business and really more of a function of us pulling back on our lower price point, more mass or retail-oriented products last year as we work through our backlog. But as we got through our backlog in the spa business to turn back on that, the retail portion or opening price point of our spa business, so we've had a little bit of impact here in North America. But broadly speaking, we haven't seen a whole lot of trade down across our other product categories.Keith J. AllmanI think with our reconfigured portfolio of lower-ticket products, I think that really helps to mitigate the large swings that you may see in bigger-ticket items.Stephen KimOkay. Any margin impact from mix?Keith J. AllmanYes, there will be a little bit, but not much.OperatorThe next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.Matthew Adrien BouleyApologies if I missed it, but in Decorative, you had DIY only down low single digits in the quarter, so a little bit better than your full year guide previously, but then you still reduced the full year revenue guide for the segment. So just maybe just speak a little bit what sort of drove that DIY result in the quarter and what changed in your full year outlook in spite of that?David A. ChaikaYes, Matt, it's Dave. In the DIY business, we did see continuing softening throughout the quarter. And I think we expect that to continue here in the back half of the year when you look at existing home sales, that tends to have a higher correlation with DIY paint in many of our other product categories and with existing home turnover being down roughly 20%, we anticipate DIY in the back half of the year probably being a little softer than we originally anticipated.Keith J. AllmanSo for the full year, that would put our DIY business expected to decrease in the high single digits.Matthew Adrien BouleyOkay. Understood. And then secondly, on that new paint facility, I guess just one, are there any start-up costs associated with that as well into the second half of next year? And just higher level on that, curious if you could speak to sort of what this does for Masco around service levels. Where did you see room for improvement? Could it lead to additional shelf space wins or PRO expansion? Just kind of any additional longer-term expectations that might arise out of that new paint facility.David A. ChaikaMatt, I'll take the cost side and maybe Keith can take the second part of that question. But on the cost side, there will be some start-up costs here in the back half of the year, probably a little bit in the first half, but mainly in the back half of this year as we really ramp up the distribution and the manufacturing capacity.Keith J. AllmanMatt, if you think about the success that we've had in our paint business, it really goes down to the relationship that we have with our channel partner, The Home Depot, and our ability to provide innovation and service to our customers and the consumers that purchase Behr. And the basis of that is really focus, and the fact that everything we do is focused on that Home Depot customer and on our supply chain around those outstanding Home Depot point of sale.And so what this new facility does is it gives us the capacity to be able to maintain industry-leading delivery performance. It gives us the logistical costs and ties in very tightly to where our consumers want to buy, and it really hones in our ability to provide that ongoing service.OperatorThe next question comes from Susan Maklari of Goldman Sachs.Susan Marie MaklariMy first question is in plumbing, you mentioned that you saw some strength in the wholesale side relative to some more weakness on retail there. Can you just give us a bit of color on how you're thinking about the inventory levels across the channels? And any commentary on sell-in versus sell-out as we think about the second half?Keith J. AllmanYes. It's been pretty consistent, Sue. There's obviously various customers who have different inventory policies based on how they want to run their business. And we work very closely with them. So there are some idiosyncrasies based on different customers. But when we look broadly across the wholesale channel, really across both wholesale and retail, but talking specifically to wholesale now, the sell-in has been very close to the sell-out. And so we are not seeing and nor do we expect any significant changes in terms of an inventory headwind or tailwind or destocking or restocking. We think it's in pretty good shape, it being the inventory levels relative to the demand patterns we're seeing.Susan Marie MaklariOkay. And then on your raws, you mentioned that you are starting to see some relief on the Decorative Architectural side of things. Can you just talk about across both Plumbing and Dec Arch, how you're thinking about the commodity cost and the input cost and how that may flow through over the next several quarters and maybe into next year?Keith J. AllmanSure. I think in terms of inflation, we would say that it peaked back in the second quarter of '22, and it's kind of moderated sequentially since then. We have not seen much deflation at this point. Certainly, container costs have come down off their peaks, and that's helped our freight. But most other costs have remained, I would say, elevated.In terms of specific commodities, we have seen some pullback in copper at 385 currently. That's below slightly the 2022 average. Zinc has come down below the '22 average, but that really only started last month. So we're not going to see that roll through our P&amp;L and into our cost of goods sold at this point, probably until into '24.So when we think about all-in deflation and plumbing, for example, we call it low single digits for the full year. And by all-in, I mean commodities as well as non-commodity costs like freight, et cetera. So low-digit deflation for the full year. In terms of Decorative, certain paint input costs have moderated sequentially, for example, resins. But others, like TiO2, for example, it's still sticky and at elevated levels. And we did have commodity inflation in the second quarter. So our guide does not have a lot of paint raw deflation built into it.So all in, for the deco segment, we're thinking about low single-digit inflation for the full year, and that's after we expect some low single-digit deflation in the second half. So all in for Masco, the enterprise, we're looking at inflation or deflation basically to be flat for the total company.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.Michael Glaser DahlKeith, on the Plumbing comment in terms of you're driving that business to get back to at least 2019 levels, which was a little above 18%, and I think for 5, 6 years, you were traveling somewhere in the 18%, if not a little bit better, it seems like you've kind of gotten the work done on price/cost more or less. Is it really just a question of when do the volumes come back as far as getting to that 18%? Or what other drivers do you think you can pull or need to pull to get back there or higher?Keith J. AllmanMike, as you know, we're always focused on driving total cost productivity, continuous improvement on a day-to-day basis, better negotiation with our suppliers. And we're driving our service proposition to continue to push profitable mix as winning a showroom supplier of the year from a significant wholesaler shows that we're doing just that. So there's other levers to pull to continue to drive on a day-to-day basis margin enhancement, and we're doing that.But clearly, with our strong innovation and brands and the ability for us to price and get that drop down in, say, that 25%, 30%, the biggest lever is incremental volume.Michael Glaser DahlGot it. Okay. And then just sticking with Plumbing, can you give us a little more color on the new acquisition, Sauna360? It sounds European-based, but just a little more color on maybe geographies, products, relative size or profitability?Keith J. AllmanSure. I'll begin by saying that we believe in our wellness business. We believe in it because it has an outstanding team. It's a great brand, a great set of brands, and we have an inherent tailwind in North America in particular here, but globally, as it relates to wellness and the mental and physical health aspects of living better and utilizing machines like we have and brands like we have to get that done. So we like the space.And this is a small bolt-on acquisition. It's consistent with our capital allocation and our acquisition strategy to have smaller bolt-ons in paint and plumbing where we can drive leverage, and this does just that. It's a sauna company based in Finland. The cost of this was EUR 125 million. The leverage that we intend to use, not only is our operational capabilities and continuous improvement in our production system, but fundamentally, our dealer network for Watkins that we have in North America. And we've demonstrated the ability to do this as we ventured into, frankly, when we went into a different brand originally with hot tubs, and then when we went into swim spas, and now in to saunas.And so this fits very nicely with our overall strategy and with the capabilities and improvements that we can bring to the business. We pay less than Masco's multiple. It's small. It will add about 1% of growth overall, modestly accretive to EPS. It's a smaller bolt-on. It's not in our guidance since we haven't closed yet. We're going to fund it out of cash on hand, maybe a little bit of short-term borrowing. But we're excited about how this can leverage our dealer network, how it continues to keep us in the forefront with things to talk about and to sell and build our brands. And this team is going to handle it very well.OperatorThe next question comes from Truman Patterson of Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonWhen I look at your first half performance, right, revenue is kind of in line with your expectations, but margin was much better in each of your segments to start the year. I'm really just trying to understand what's been the driver of this op margin performance? Was it a little bit better pricing environment, some cost-out initiatives or lower investments, maybe some accelerated cost deflation, et cetera? Just what were kind of the big drivers of that?David A. ChaikaTruman, it's David. Yes, I think you hit on 3 of the 4. It was better price realization, better cost-out and really improving our operational efficiencies. The one that really wasn't as significant as we expected was deflation. As Keith mentioned, we have seen some deflation, but that really wasn't above what we expected, especially when you consider the length of our supply chain and visibility. We sort of had a pretty good understanding of what the deflation impact might be in the second quarter. So it really came down to the productivity improvements and better price realization that drove the strong performance in 2Q.Truman Andrew PattersonThere's nothing onetime in nature on those kind of internal productivity improvements where they couldn't continue into the back half of the year, is there?David A. ChaikaNo, nothing really onetime. Nice improvement. I would say there's probably a little bit of timing on expenses that probably got pushed out in the second half of the year as well. So I'm going to call that a onetime event, but it did contribute to the strong performance in 2Q.Truman Andrew PattersonOkay. Got you. And then in certain categories we heard of, in the U.S. specifically, we heard of a little bit of demand improvement in the back part of the second quarter, just trying to understand across any of your channels or product categories, if you will, in the U.S. saw any sort of kind of stability or improvement?Keith J. AllmanIt was pretty consistent throughout the quarter.OperatorThe next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer of Deutsche Bank.Joseph David AhlersmeyerJust maybe a quick housekeeping item. Can you talk about your performance in lighting and hardware either year-to-date or in each of the first couple of quarters of the year?Keith J. AllmanThese businesses really have been impacted by the market softness as all of our businesses have. I'd say that for Q2, they were down in that 20% range. We expect them -- they've taken price. We're working on cost actions as we are across the entire portfolio. I would say that to expect these businesses to perform roughly in line with our low double-digit volume decline expectations of the R&amp;R market.Joseph David AhlersmeyerUnderstood. And then just thinking about the back half guide, looking at your second quarter margins relative to a few years ago, 2019 actually looked very similar gross margin and then margins by the segments as well, understand the volume impact to the second half. But could you maybe parse it out between what we might see the third quarter and the fourth quarter? Might we see normal margin seasonality? Or is the fact that the third quarter is likely to be down more year-over-year, likely to hit those margins a little more than the fourth quarter?David A. ChaikaJoe, it's Dave. I think you're more likely to see the typical margin seasonality stronger margins in Q3 compared to Q4. Q4 tends to be a lower margin quarter in general with lower volume. I think in terms of year-over-year, we do expect year-over-year expansion probably less -- more modest year-over-year expansion here in 3Q from what we saw clearly in 2Q. Then considering our comp in Q4 of '22, probably a little bit more year-over-year expansion in Q4.Joseph David AhlersmeyerSo expansion in both of those quarters at the consolidated level on operating margin?David A. ChaikaCorrect.OperatorThe next question comes from Philip Ng of Jefferies.Philip H. NgCongrats on a really strong quarter. For me, I guess, first question, on Plumbing North America, any color how the business performed, if you kind of flushed out the spa business because I think you have some tougher comps and potentially some destock? When did that kind of level off? And I believe Keith, you alled out some relative weakness in the home center versus the PRO channel. Can you give a little more color on what's driving the relative difference in the 2 channels?Keith J. AllmanYes. If I said that, I misspoke. I would say, if anything, our PRO was a little bit stronger. I think that has to do with some project backlogs working through the system. But not -- I wouldn't lean too heavily into that. It's just maybe a slight better performance in PRO versus DIY. So I want to clear that. Could you ask me the second part of that question?Philip H. NgThe first part was really more on -- any color on how the North American Plumbing business performed ex the spa business? Because I think that part was a little more challenging. It would be helpful to remind us when are those comparison headwinds kind of do you guys lap that spa thing?Keith J. AllmanStill seeing -- in North America, we saw really earlier, we saw the volume start to turn down. So volume and top line challenged in Europe. Europe was down only about 3% in Q1 and then started to accelerate as expected. So we're in both North America and Europe in plumbing, we're experiencing volume challenges. I would say very solid execution, really driving good price/cost realization, getting our supply chain back in tune and providing the service levels and the productivity and cost efficiency. That was a real driver.So when we think about our performance versus expectation, as we said earlier in the call, top line is kind of where we expected it to be. But our performance, particularly in Plumbing, is better than expected. We quickly got after the cost. We're driving productivity, and the team is doing a great job in both North America and Europe.Philip H. NgOkay. That's helpful. And perhaps a question for Dave. I mean a lot of questions today on the relative performance in the back half on margins, maybe fading a little bit versus the first half. You called out maybe some expense getting pushed out, modest expense getting pushed out in the back half and some investments that will kind of funnel through. Can you help size some of those headwinds that we should account for to better appreciate the margin for us through the year?David A. ChaikaYes. I'm not going to size them up, Phil, but just enough to contribute to a little bit lower margin performance in the second half as compared to first half. We're talking growth investments in PRO representatives for paints. It could be a little bit of additional marketing compared to the first half. But beyond that, just a little bit of a headwind on the margin side.OperatorThe next question comes from Adam Baumgarten of Zelman &amp; Associates.Adam Michael BaumgartenJust on the paint side, one of your large competitors is expecting a high single-digit decline in raw materials, and you guys are out looking at low single-digit inflation. Just curious maybe what the difference may be there if it's timing or different formulations, just if you could give a little more color on that.Keith J. AllmanWhen we talk about low inflation, that includes everything, all in, in the cost basket. Specifically to your question that on raws, yes, there's different levels of vertical integration, some different supply chains that are used. So there's differences to how we manufacture and certainly a difference in the distribution cost structure and how we go to market. So there's a couple of big differences there.David A. ChaikaYes. I think it's probably more a function of timing depending on how vertically integrated we are compared to others, and what inputs are actually buying compared to overall formulations. A little bit of the difference could be accounted for in the inventory, accounting practice as well as LIFO or FIFO. We're all FIFO here at Masco.Adam Michael BaumgartenOkay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe any update on the promotional environment in the paint aisle at this point, just given the softness in DIY?Keith J. AllmanYes. In general, I'd say the level of promotions industry-wide has been moderate and somewhat similar to last year. We are seeing some more selective events and promotions on certain items. We obviously work with our partner on events and promotions that we think will drive and help profitable sales. But ultimately, it's our channel partners' decision on the promotional environment. But I'd say it's similar to maybe a little bit in spotty cases, a little bit in specific promotions, as I mentioned, a little bit more, but not terribly.OperatorThe next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital.Garik Simha ShmoisI was hoping you could talk a little bit more just on what you're seeing from the consumer. I think you mentioned that you're expecting the downturn to be a bit shallower than previously anticipated, but then DIY is also expected to be a little bit softer just because of the lower levels of housing turnover. So any additional color on where you think the consumers have at this point would be great.David A. ChaikaGarik, it's Dave. Yes, I'd say it's a little -- our read is sort of choppy. The consumer seems to be strong. Clearly, when you look at spend across industries, the consumer seems to be spending in other industries such as travel and leisure, and you've seen those industries pick up significantly this year, a little more pullback in home improvement spending probably as affordability has been pinched a little bit as rates have risen. So the consumer, we think, is still very interested in investing in their homes, especially as home equity levels remain high, but we have seen a little bit of a pullback. And I'd characterize it as a bit choppy and a bit uneven overall, but still think the consumer seems to be pretty healthy.Garik Simha ShmoisOkay. Got it. Follow-up question is just on the M&amp;A environment. Just more broadly, has the pipeline changed at all? You're announcing the Sauna360 deal. Are other opportunities maybe consistent in size and in theme with that acquisition? Or are there any chunkier opportunities out there?David A. ChaikaGarik, I'd say the -- our pipeline has not changed. Clearly, the M&amp;A environment has changed, as we've talked about, definitely has been slower over the past year or so, less opportunities coming to market. Sellers clearly see that some buyers might not be as competitive, so they pulled back, plus they don't want to potentially sell off weaker earnings. So definitely a slower M&amp;A environment, but our outlook and our focus on bolt-on acquisitions has not changed, and we continue to cultivate some nice opportunities.OperatorOur last question comes from Keith Hughes at Truist Securities.Keith Brian HughesQuestion on PRO paint. You've had just a tremendous -- you and Home Depot had a tremendous share gaining on the PRO paint. And as you said, in the prepared statements is kind of leveling out here a little bit. I guess, what's the next step in PRO paint?? Is there more products, more services you can offer the PRO paint? Or where do you and your partner expect to go with this?Keith J. AllmanIt's really about service, Keith. It's 10 years ago when we started this, we made a list of the things that we could do to improve the service for the PRO painter. We have tweaked what's in the can, in some light cases, but fundamentally, we believe we have the brand and the innovation and the right price points to be successful. We've got a great partner in terms of the distribution channel. So it's really about service. So it's about understanding what the PRO needs and scaling that up and making sure we're delivering that across the entire market.So as I've mentioned before, different delivery options that they like, better loyalty programs, more improved service, it's a lot of keeping on to what we've been doing and continuing to drive it, and it's worked. It's certainly -- the COVID situation and our ability to supply got our product in a lot more hands of the builders. And we saw tremendous Net Promoter Scores, so they like it. So it's a matter of staying focused and continuing to drive incremental improvements in service and to continue to grow at a greater clip than the market.Renee BenedictWe'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning and for your interest in Masco. That concludes today's call. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 7% revenue growth in the second quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices while growth remained in the high single digits for both Commodity Insights and Mobility. As you will recall, we took decisive action to protect margins beginning in the second quarter of last year. And lapping those actions led to a modest contraction in adjusted operating margins year-over-year. Our continued focus on delivering profitable growth and prudently managing our capital allocation combined to drive double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this quarter. We expect positive revenue growth in all divisions for the remainder of the year as well as continued double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In addition to strong financial results, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with an emphasis on innovation. We continue to drive rapid advancement in our AI initiatives. We'll talk more about the guiding principles behind our AI strategy in a moment. But we already have a number of internal initiatives and pilot programs. Additionally, in May, we launched a conversational AI assistant called ChatIQ on Capital IQ Pro Labs for internal testing. We'll have more to say about ChatIQ as we get closer to a formal launch to external customers. But it's the first example of how Kensho will deploy LLM-based technology across S&amp;P Global. We're also very excited about some of the developments in our conversations with the largest participants in the private markets. We have an active and incredibly productive dialogue with private equity and private credit customers. We're currently exploring many ways that we can work together to apply our expertise in ratings, analytics and pricing across the credit markets. We'll have more specifics to share here as well as this dialogue develops into commercial opportunities. We're seeing some early but encouraging signs of stabilization in the macro environment, which leads to a modest improvement to the macro outlook, helping to inform our financial guidance. Lastly, illustrating our commitment to disciplined stewardship of the business, we completed the divestiture of Engineering Solutions in the second quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the five strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. First, I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. We've mentioned over the last couple of quarters that we've seen some lengthening of the sales cycle, which we believe was driven by customer sensitivity around spending. Our cross-sell efforts are also creating larger contracts, which take longer to close. While sales cycles remain a bit longer than normal, we've started to see some stabilization, and customer conversations have been very constructive. We continue to see very high customer retention rates and contract expansions, evidenced by the 8% growth in subscription revenue across our 5 divisions. The value of our largest and most well-known products, those key brands and benchmarks that the markets rely on, is being recognized by our customers in a challenging and sometimes confusing macro environment. Customers are also emphasizing many of the same strategic priorities that we are, namely private markets, climate, energy transition and AI. This is evidenced in the 40% growth in energy transition revenue we saw in our Commodity Insights division in the second quarter. As customers navigate a market with higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly evolving technology, we hear they trust S&amp;P Global and they want to do more with us. We've worked hard to build that trust. And we're as confident as we've ever been in the long-term growth of the company. Related to Ratings, global billed issuance returned to positive growth, increasing 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. We began to see some signs of stabilizing interest rates among central banks. While we did see some likely event-driven issuance in the second quarter ahead of the debt ceiling events in the United States, we're also seeing more economists, including our own, expecting only one or two more rate hikes from major central banks over the remainder of 2023. Overall, issuance saw a higher proportion of refinancing activity with issuers tracking market conditions closely. We expect those pockets of issuance to become more frequent as the market adjusts to the new normal of higher for longer. We're pleased with the strength we saw in corporate issuance with both high-yield and investment-grade issuance increasing notably year-over-year, though the high-yield growth is coming off of a very low comparison. This strength is offset somewhat by a softer environment for bank loans and structured finance. Importantly, rating withdrawals, which are a measure of churn in Ratings, are down this year. That illustrates the strength of the S&amp;P brand and the increasing value of a rating in an uncertain credit environment. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. The June release of updates and enhancements of Capital IQ Pro was one of the largest and most significant in years. We completely reinvented RatingsDirect on Capital IQ Pro and launched loan pricing and analytics as well. Customers have already shown an incredibly positive reaction to the enhancements on Capital IQ Pro. And these new features have contributed to key competitive displacements and enhanced our competitive positioning. In Commodity Insights, we also launched the first offering of base shipping rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing. This is significant as we expect the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels, including liquid natural gas, to grow significantly in the coming years. Our Sustainable1 team launched a new Nature &amp; Biodiversity Risk dataset, assessing nature-related impacts and dependencies across the company's operations. This assessment can be applied across the asset, company and portfolio level, which gives our corporate and investor customers a greater ability to quantify both dependency and impact on location-specific ecosystems. As we introduced last quarter, our Vitality revenue metric consists of revenue derived from our new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the second quarter, Vitality revenue held steady at 11% of total revenue. I am both pleased and impressed that the top 4 contributors to our Vitality revenue in the quarter came from 4 different divisions, clearly demonstrating that our commitment to innovation and growth spans the entire organization. Turning now to a topic that I know is on everyone's mind, artificial intelligence. I wanted to provide some color on S&amp;P Global's key advantages and the guiding principles that will govern our use and the implementation of AI, both internally and within our products. We're thrilled with the progress that our teams have made building, testing and implementing tools in various use cases across the organization. While Kensho gives us an incredible advantage in this arena, it isn't our only one. The datasets we have, large, proprietary and truly differentiated, create a remarkable advantage for S&amp;P Global as well. Our trusted brands also allow us to have conversations with industry partners, technology infrastructure providers and customers with credibility. We, through our brands, are known and trusted. And we know that trust will play a huge role in the success of any AI-based products that come to market in the coming years. As we more fully embrace the technological advances of our era, we need to make sure we do so with prudence and discipline. Particularly given the investment necessary to develop AI-driven tools, we want to take each step with a keen focus on creating customer value rather than simply creating tools because the technology exists. We will allocate the necessary capital to these new projects based on our confidence in the strategic and financial impact on the company. While Kensho is deeply engaged in AI research within S&amp;P Global, we want to make sure we aren't dogmatic in our approach. We'll leverage leading technology regardless of whether it was developed at Kensho, developed elsewhere within the divisions or comes via a vendor or a partner. Lastly, we want to continue our practice of aggressively defending and protecting our intellectual property and our data. We have safeguards and restrictions embedded in our contracts that ensure third parties and customers cannot independently monetize or build commercial products with our data without our consent and our economic participation. We're committed to transparency with our shareholders. And we'll provide regular updates on our new product launches as they take place. We'll move fast. And we'll also make the necessary investments in time and resources to ensure success. Shifting now to how we lead and inspire. During the second quarter, we further demonstrated our commitment to transparency and accountability through the publication of our annual Sustainability Impact Report and TCFD report. We also published for the first time our annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, highlighting our commitment to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive company and world. We're honored that so many respected organizations have recognized the efforts that we have made to build a company that always pursues excellence. As you can see on this slide, we have received recognition not just for our efforts in sustainability and equality but also in our governance and Board oversight and our civic contributions. I've never been more proud to be part of S&amp;P Global. Of course, disciplined leadership means delivering on our ongoing operational and financial outcomes. We're pleased with the strong execution across all divisions this quarter. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our divisions in the second quarter, including accelerating revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices. While our trailing 12-month margins have contracted 90 basis points year-over-year, we expect that trend to improve as we progress through this year and lap the issuance headwinds we saw through most of last year. With half of the year behind us, we still see many of the same macroeconomic factors impacting our business through the remainder of the year. While we no longer expect a technical recession globally, we do expect headwinds to persist from an economic slowdown, primarily in financial services end markets. We expect to continue to benefit from secular trends, though near-term volatility can impact different parts of the business in different ways. While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from the first half, we wanted to reiterate our confidence in the multiyear financial targets we put out for the divisions and for the consolidated company at Investor Day. As you know, our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect billed issuance to be up approximately 4% to 8% for the full year, up 1 point from our prior expectation. Our latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance, though also slightly improved from last quarter. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign and international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. We have completed our July 2023 global refinancing study. And you can see one of the reasons for our optimism for our Ratings business over the next several years. There is over $8 trillion of debt rated by S&amp;P Global maturing through 2026 and nearly $13 trillion maturing through 2028. This, in addition to assumed improvements in the macro environment over the next few years, gives us great confidence in our ability to drive profitable multiyear growth in Ratings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenThank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased with the financial performance of the business in the second quarter. The clear indicator is that the secular tailwinds continue to drive growth across our largest products, though some minor headwinds impact smaller parts of the business. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 4% revenue growth and a 6% reduction in fully diluted share count, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of operating margin compression. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods but including approximately $10 million from this year's tuck-in acquisitions, revenue growth would have been 7%. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all remaining divisions, including Ratings, which saw a pickup in issuance activity in the quarter. While the debt markets remain a challenging environment for issuers, this is the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. As Doug mentioned, we also saw acceleration in revenue growth across Market Intelligence and Indices with continued impressive growth in Commodity Insights and Mobility. We will walk through the divisions in more detail in a moment. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, which we'll also discuss in more detail. Turning to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue increased 17% to $70 million in the quarter driven by climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. We continue to see a shift in customer appetite away from buying pure ESG scores and towards more purchases of raw data, which we believe will benefit S&amp;P Global in the long run. We consistently hear from customers that our Trucost dataset is higher quality than the data from many competitors. And the breadth of our offerings across the commodity markets and ESG indices will contribute to strong growth for multiple years. That said, we are seeing some signs of adverse market sentiment, particularly from large financial institutions in the United States that are impacting our revenue growth in the short term as others in the space have also called out. We believe these headwinds are temporary while the growth drivers are secular. Even though sustainability and energy transition revenue currently represents only a low single-digit percent of our total revenue, it is an important strategic driver of long-term growth. We will continue to make the necessary investments in people, data, product development and partnerships to drive long-term growth. Given the uncertainty around the regulatory landscape and the political climate, particularly in the U.S., we can no longer confidently reiterate the previous 2026 target of $800 million in sustainability and energy transition. We'll continue to report this metric on a quarterly basis. And we will assess the potential for long-term revenue contribution from these important products as the market continues to evolve. Private market solutions revenue increased 5% to $106 million driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence products for private markets, offset by declines in Ratings private markets revenue. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $343 million in the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to prior year. Now turning to synergies. In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized $144 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $574 million. And we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the second quarter and an annualized run rate of $68 million. Turning to expense growth. Total adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year as we are beginning to lap the proactive expense management actions taken last year. We saw a $23 million favorable impact from FX in the quarter. And the divestiture of Engineering Solutions was favorable by $50 million. We also generated incremental cost synergies that lowered expense growth by approximately $80 million relative to last year. As you will recall, we lowered accruals for incentive compensation in the second quarter of last year. This was done to reflect the headwinds we were facing, predominantly in our Ratings business. Incentive compensation resets each year. So we're seeing the natural increase in those expenses beginning this quarter. Incentive compensation and commissions were the largest single contributor to expense growth in the second quarter. The year-over-year impact of incentive compensation will be a similar driver of expense growth in the third quarter, though we expect expense growth to moderate meaningfully in the fourth quarter as the comparison becomes more favorable. The year-over-year impact of the reset of incentive compensation was a key driver of expense growth in each of our divisions. And we expect to see the same quarterly phasing in our division margin results in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well. Lastly, we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. And that was reflected this quarter. Core investment growth represents the investments we are making in strategic initiatives, people, cloud as well as the incremental investments we are making to fund our AI development at Kensho and within the divisions. Most importantly, we continue to expect approximately 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6%, driven by strong growth in Data &amp; Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop grew 4% in the second quarter, driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter, though this was offset by some modest softness in nonrecurring sales. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid- to high 90s. Data &amp; Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit &amp; Risk Solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products as well as double-digit growth in Credit Analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year due to the drivers previously discussed. Operating profit increased 4% and the operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 32.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved to 220 basis points. As we mentioned last quarter, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year. Last quarter, we signaled that we may come in at the low end of our previous guidance range. We're not trying to signal deterioration since April, though we do see modestly elevated risk to the back half. Given the heightened uncertainty, particularly within sustainability and energy transition, we're taking the formal step at this point to modestly lower the guidance by 50 basis points on revenue and operating margin. Now turning to Ratings. In the second quarter, we saw a spike in issuance activity, particularly in May, which from a seasonality perspective is a very important month for debt markets. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue as we saw investment-grade and high-yield activity pick up. Non-transaction revenue increased 4% primarily due to annual fees and growth in CRISIL, though non-transaction growth was tempered by continued declines in ICR revenue. Adjusted expenses increased 12%. This resulted in a 4% increase in operating profit and a 180 basis point decrease in operating margin to 57.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by last year's revenue declines. We raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first half. Our outlook for transaction revenue for the full year has improved somewhat, though some of this is offset by non-transaction revenue due to greater weakness in ICR than we initially anticipated. The net result is a 1 point increase in our Ratings revenue guidance range. And we now expect Ratings revenue growth of 5% to 7%. While we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, we are reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 8%, driven by double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; Insights. Growth was tempered somewhat by declines in the Upstream business. Upstream Data &amp; Insights declined approximately 2% year-over-year. While subscription ACV growth is positive, we have deprioritized one-time sales in Upstream as we focus on higher-quality recurring revenue products. As such, we are lowering our expectations modestly for Upstream for the full year and now expect that business line to be flat to down slightly for the full year compared to our previous expectation for low single-digit growth. Price Assessments and Energy &amp; Resources Data &amp; Insights grew 12% and 11%, respectively, compared to prior year, driven by strong performance in crude oil and fuels and refining products and strong commercial momentum in subscription products across both business lines. Advisory and Transaction revenue also grew 12%, driven by strength in Global Trading Services and strong performance in conference revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 5%. Operating profit for CI increased 12% and operating margin improved 160 basis points to 45.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have improved 220 basis points. We see stronger trends for our benchmarks, data and insights. And we enjoy a position of trust in the commodity markets. We continue to expect strong subscription growth through the second half. And there is no change to our outlook for revenue or margins. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, the contribution from Market Scan within the Dealer segment and strong underwriting volumes in the Financials and Other business line. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by the continued benefit of price increases within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 5% year-over-year, driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and Other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 13% due primarily to the drivers I discussed previously but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit and 160 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 60 basis points. As we noted last quarter, we expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. And our guidance for Mobility for the full year is unchanged. Turning to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 3% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-rated derivatives volume and data subscriptions, partially offset by a modest decline in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 1% year-over-year primarily driven by mix shift into lower-priced index ETF products, partially offset by market appreciation and modest year-over-year net inflows. Importantly, this decline was due to mix shift, not due to price concessions or renegotiated contracts. Exchange-rated derivatives revenue increased 17% on increased trading volumes across all key contracts. Data &amp; Custom Subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 15% year-over-year due to reasons previously discussed. Operating profit in Indices decreased 2%. And the operating margin decreased 330 basis points from last year's high-water mark to 68.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 30 basis points. As reflected in today's results, we've seen market appreciation, though mix of AUM is playing an increasingly important role in asset-linked fees' revenue. And net inflows remain somewhat unpredictable in the near term. All of this is reflected in our new higher guidance range. As we mentioned last quarter, our continued investments to drive long-term growth as well as the timing of expense recognition will impact the quarterly phasing of our margins. We expect relatively high expense growth in Indices in the third quarter as well before expense growth moderates in the fourth quarter. This will ultimately allow us to deliver margins within the new higher guidance range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Now let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023. We're no longer calling for a global recession, though we do expect lower-than-normal economic activity through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above historical averages as well. As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the first half as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. Our full year guidance is largely unchanged on a consolidated basis as outperformance in Ratings and Indices is offset by slightly lower expectations for Market Intelligence as we've begun to signal last quarter. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, we're pleased with the results from the second quarter, particularly with a return to strong double-digit growth in both Ratings transaction revenue and our adjusted diluted EPS. With multiple variables at play in the markets, we're encouraged by the fact that the tailwinds tend to impact the largest parts of our business while the headwinds are impacting relatively small contributors to our financial results. It takes tremendous effort from many talented people to deliver results like these. And I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their relentless drive to power global markets. We're looking forward to delivering a strong second half of the year. And with that, I would like to invite Edouard Tavernier, President of S&amp;P Global Mobility, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.Mark GrantThank you, Ewout. (Operator Instructions) Operator, we will now take our first question.Question and Answer SessionOperatorOur first question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.Ashish SabadraIn the prepared remarks, there was a reference to lengthening of the sales cycle. I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color where you were -- where explicitly you're seeing it, in which particular division or it's been across the board.Douglas L. PetersonAshish, this is Doug. Can you please repeat the question? You talked about the sales cycle for all divisions or for a specific product? I'm sorry, I didn't pick up your question.Ashish SabadraSorry about that, Doug. Yes, I was just wondering if you could provide more color on where you're seeing that lengthening of the sales cycle. Has it been focused on a particular division? Or has that been across the board?Douglas L. PetersonGot it. Thank you, Ashish. Well, first of all, we've seen that in the last quarter and going forward that people are thinking very cautiously about expense management, especially in the financial services sector. This is an area where people have been looking at how they're going to be managing their own expenses. They're looking at the environment, which we described as quite difficult. Given inflation, given the interest rate environment, there's not a lot of deal flow. So this is where we're mainly seeing slowdown in some of the sales cycle. So although this stabilized in the second quarter, it had actually -- we started seeing it in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year. And now we're seeing it in the second quarter. But it did stabilize. As you recall, we also have some cases where it's taking us longer to renegotiate with our customers because we're bringing them more value. We're bringing together multiple products. So sometimes consolidating products and consolidating contracts takes a little bit more. But let me hand it over to Edouard since he's on the call as well to tell us a little bit about what he's seeing in the mobility sector in the same sense.Edouard TavernierThank you, Doug. So in the mobility sector, we're seeing trends similar to what Doug has described in the sense that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we did see a slight softening of retention rates and a slight lengthening of sales cycles. And what that pertains to is the normalization of the sector after a couple of years of really, really elevated kind of retention rates. So at this point, we feel the situation has normalized, it's stabilized. Our retention rates remain very, very strong by historical standards, slightly less elevated than the past couple of years and business -- kind of new business momentum is now stabilized.OperatorOur next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.Heather Nicole BalskyI was curious, on the call, you talked about the near-term challenges in climate and sustainability and some of the pressure you're seeing. And you talked about, essentially, you pulled your long-term target. But also earlier in the call, you reiterated your view on mid-term growth for your businesses. I'm curious, given the pressure you're seeing in the sustainability area, kind of what do you see offsetting that, that gives you confidence in your target?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenHeather, this is Ewout. So just to be very clear about sustainability and energy transition, we're not backing away from the $800 million target. We are currently backing away from the timing around that because we're not 100% certain anymore that we can hit that by 2026. Why? Because we are still continuing to see very positive trends with respect to the longer-term secular trends around ESG. We think that all of those underlying drivers are still there. But in the short term, we are impacted by some uncertainties, uncertainties about the regulatory landscape, the political climate, mostly in the U.S. We're seeing some on the buy-side firms reconsidering what they want to do around sustainability. But we see continued actually pocket of strength in our business. Think about our climate activities, think about ESG raw data, energy transition, all of these products continue to grow very well. I also would like to point out that we expect a reacceleration of our sustainability and energy transition revenues growth in the second half of this year. So growth will come back in the second half of this year. And we're still very positive and optimistic about the outlook for the medium and long term.OperatorOur next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities.Seth Robert WeberI wanted to ask about the Ratings -- the operating margin in the Ratings business, which came down with revenue going up. I know you addressed some of the kind of short-term expense headwinds there. But can you just talk a little bit more about your confidence for margins to get -- to ramp higher through the back half of the year in the Ratings business specifically?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenFirst of all, I think this is exactly in line with our expectations, the margin development in Ratings. And let me explain why that's the case. We're saying what we said for the company as a whole, we are seeing now also this quarter for Ratings with respect to the expense reset of incentive compensation compared to last year. Last year, in the second quarter, we saw a large change in the accrual for incentive compensation across the board but also in Ratings, both for the short-term and the long-term incentive compensation accruals. And we are resetting that for this year based on the strong performance of the company and the strong performance of the Ratings business as well. So we are overall very positive about the medium- and long-term perspective and outlook. If you look at where we are from a trailing 12-month perspective for margin for Ratings, we're at 55.2%. We're guiding this year to 56% to 57%. And then as you know, we have our IR targets for 2025 and 2026, 58% to 60%. So you will continue to see strong margin improvement of Ratings over the next few periods.OperatorOur next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.Manav Shiv PatnaikI just want to focus on the Market Intelligence revenue. I guess, you lowered it by 50 basis points. Did I hear you right by saying most of that was because of the, I guess, the sustainability trends you talked about? And I was just curious like, Doug, you mentioned the weakness mainly in the financial services market. I'm guessing that's most exposed here in Market Intelligence. In the spirit of all the vendor consolidation and those kinds of things that pick up in this period, are there any, I guess, trends or just strategy to be a winner in that area?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenManav, you are absolutely right. Where we are with the business at this moment is exactly the same place where we thought the business would be when we had our last call in April. The business is performing in line with expectations. And the only reason why we are making the change with respect to the guidance range has to do with the short-term uncertainty around sustainability and energy transition. So to give you a little bit more color around it, if you look at some of the key drivers of Market Intelligence, ACV growth is good. Closing rates are good. Retention rates are good. User growth is good. We see a lot of new product launches bringing to the -- being brought to the market by Market Intelligence. So overall, we believe the business is in a very good shape. At the end of the day, we are very excited about the potential of Market Intelligence, particularly combining the two companies together in that segment and the potential it will have with respect to commercial growth. And we fully expect to hit our Investor Day targets for Market Intelligence.OperatorOur next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanWanted to go back to the sustainability revenue streams. You mentioned seeing the shift from scores to data. I wanted to understand better if that has pricing implications. And also, is it harder to build a moat when it's the data, not either ratings or scores, that are being demanded by customers? And then maybe I know Trucost is very high quality. But maybe you could talk about how its proprietary and other data brands within ESG where you have an advantage.Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Toni. Let me just take a step back one second and talk about what we're hearing in the markets. I've been traveling this year. And I've been in every continent -- I've been in except for Africa and Australia. But I've been around the world. I've been traveling a lot. And in every single conversation I have, we talk about sustainability, climate, ESG, energy transition. This is on everyone's mind. And depending on where you are in the world, it's either moving faster, maybe a little bit slower in the U.S. than it had been before. But there's also a shift going on in the way that regulators and investors think about their accountability to deliver their own views on climate change and on energy transition. The investors and regulators no longer want whoever is managing their money or who they're regulating to just make a decision based blindly on a score. They want them to have their own opinion based on their own analysis and building models from the bottom up. So when you think about that shift taking place in the markets, you then -- we bring the kind of data which has time series on it. We've had information that goes back 15, 20, 30 years. Trucost last quarter grew 38%. Our climate service, which is something that people are using for modeling climate change and physical risk, that grew 78%. So we're seeing that some of these, I call them proprietary data or modeling services that we have, are really in high growth and high demand. As you know, we also built a Climate Credit Analytics model with Oliver Wyman. That grew over 50% in the second quarter. And so we see across the globe that people are starting to make decisions themselves. And they can no longer rely on just one single data input. They need to have the data. So I think that we have a great head start by having bought Trucost 7 years ago. We had the S&amp;P Dow Jones Sustainability products, which started over 20 years ago. And let me hand it over to Edouard, who can give a little bit of color also for the automotive and mobility sector.Edouard TavernierWe have a couple of good examples actually of what Doug was talking about in Mobility and the opportunities we're able to unlock now as part of S&amp;P Global in partnership with S1. Doug mentioned Climanomics. We launched in June a version Climanomics which assesses physical risk for the automotive sector, where we were able to feed all our supply chain data on the automotive sector within the Climanomics platform. That's one example. The bigger one actually is we are now building a carbon accounting dataset for the mobility sector. And as you know in automotive, the key question mark is can Scope 3 emissions pertaining to vehicles on the road and the upstream supply chain of the battery?And in this space, we have a unique opportunity with our proprietary data to become the sort of record of carbon accounting data for the automotive industry. So a couple of examples here about how raw data itself, combined with our S1 expertise, can really create some unique and defensible products.OperatorOur next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.Keen Fai TongYou've maintained your outlook for Commodity Insights revenue growth for the full year. Can you talk about the sensitivity of Commodity Insights revenue to a pullback in oil prices? What are the puts and takes in the various parts of the business?Douglas L. PetersonThanks, George. Well, as we've talked about over many years, the sensitivity to the price of oil in the Commodity Insights business is actually not very important to get to really low oil prices, like below the 60s, into the 50s and 40s. And similarly, the same thing happens. It needs to get well over $100 before it starts creating sensitivity to the markets and to the industry. What we're actually seeing is a lot of interest and a lot of growth outside of what would be oil and gas. As you know, we have a large sustainability set of products and climate change products, energy transition within Commodity Insights. We also see a lot of interest and a lot of growth in what we've done in terms of combining the product sets from the old Platts business with the ENR business from IHS Markit. This is where you're taking prices and benchmarks and adding in forecasting and research and analytics. So we see a lot of interest in what we're doing. Our customers are asking for more. And we're layering on top of that artificial intelligence tools, analytical tools, better vision, better charting capabilities, ability to use our platforms more simply. We've taken multiple products and combined them into one or two solutions. So across the board, we're seeing that our clients need more. They need to understand more about what's happening in the energy market. So the sensitivity to the price of oil really doesn't kick in until the oil price drops a lot or gets really, really expensive.OperatorOur next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.Faiza AlwyI wanted to ask about the index business and a couple of questions there. First, wanted to get a sense of what you're assuming in terms of your AUM and how you're thinking about ETD revenues in the back half of the year. I think you had previously talked about a pretty significant decline, so curious if that's still the case. And then just last question around that is you talked about a mix impact on the fees associated with the AUM-related revenues. Give us a bit more perspective on what's going on there.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenAbsolutely, Faiza. And let me combine all three of your questions in one answer. So first of all, the business is seeing very healthy flows. We have seen very strong U.S. equity flows at $53 billion. We have also seen very solid fixed income flows for the quarter. That was at $6.5 billion. So we think the business is seeing really the positive impact from the overall positive sentiments around the markets we have seen over the last couple of weeks and months. So that's first. Then with respect to the outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of our assumptions, we have assumed no further market appreciation from the June 30 level onwards. And we have also -- looking at the ETD volumes, we have assumed that volumes for ETDs remain at a positive place but coming down slightly from where we were in the first half of this year. I also would like to point out that if you look at where we ended the quarter from an overall AUM perspective, we're about 19% up compared to the point where we were at the end of the second quarter of last year. So certainly, the starting point for the second half of this year is very strong. If you look at mix, yes, there is always going to be some kind of a mix in flows to certain products versus other products. We have seen that in the past as well. That will normally normalize over time. So we think this is more short-term noise due to that flow seasonality. But from a medium- and long-term perspective, we believe that there is still a correlation between AUM levels as a key driver of overall AUM fees growth for the business. So in other words, if you combine all of these trends together, we're very happy that we could raise the guidance for the index business for the second time in a row. And we're very optimistic about the outlook for the remaining of the year for the index business.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.Alexander KrammJust wanted to come back to the Market Intelligence guidance. I think you made this comment, and hopefully I'm not misquoting here, that you're lowering the guide officially, but you're not trying to signal anything. I'm not sure what that really means. So maybe you can flesh it out a little bit. You talked to the low end last quarter at 6.5%. Now you're lowering the range, but you're still leaving it very wide. So theoretically, the midpoint is actually higher than what you said before. So maybe just help us kind of like say what has changed, if anything, and then maybe just flesh out the margin of the guide as well.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenHappy to clarify that, Alex. So what I've said before is we think the business in all the aspects is performing in line with expectations, what we had a quarter ago. So we don't see any deterioration in any of the underlying business lines within Market Intelligence. And it is actually exactly where we thought it would be at this point in time. And also, with respect to the book of business, the ACV growth, retention levels, sales cycles and so on, we see exactly what we would expect to see at this moment. But as we have highlighted during the call, there is uncertainty about sustainability and energy transition, particularly ESG scores is a part of the revenue stream for the Market Intelligence business. And we are a bit prudent here deliberately in order to change the guidance here. We're not pointing to any point in this guidance range. We're just lowering the guidance at this point in time. But as we have said, we are actually really positive and optimistic about the outlook of Market Intelligence. We see a lot of positive trends underneath the business. And I've mentioned those before. But let me just give another couple of examples of that. The combination of the capabilities is working. So we're seeing a lot of new products that is in development with respect to combining Market Intelligence and financial services of IHS Markit. We see increased value realization with customers and actually a slight pickup in pricing in the business. We should also benefit from trends of consolidation of data vendors. And we are one of the beneficiaries of that. So many positive things that are positive trends for Market Intelligence. We're just really prudent. And that's the main reason around the sustainability revenues in the near term.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.Jeffrey Marc SilberI'm sorry to keep honing in on Market Intelligence, but I wanted to focus on margins. I know you slightly lowered the adjusted operating margin guidance. But it still implies a pretty steep ramp in the second half of the year. Are there any timing issues or cost cuts that are impacting this? And if not, how do you expect to see that margin acceleration in the back half?Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. Thank you so much for that question. You're absolutely right that we see quite some seasonality in margins in Market Intelligence, but by the way, also in several of our other segments during this year. And that has to do with the reason that I mentioned before around incentive compensation, where we saw a large pullback in incentive compensation in the second and third quarter of last year. So that is what we are going to lap this year. But then in the end, in the fourth quarter, we have much easier comps. And just to give you a data point for the company as a whole, that would mean that we are expecting from an expense perspective that expenses for the company as a whole for this year will still end up in low single-digit growth territory for the company as a whole. So you would expect there for that reason that the fourth quarter margins are going to be really strong and the expense growth in the fourth quarter is going to be really low in order to achieve those outcomes. So also, let me give you another data point in terms of margin expansion for the company as a whole. We still expect 60 to 160 basis points margin expansion for the company as a whole. And for Market Intelligence, you're also looking at quite a significant increase in margins over the next 2 quarters from a trailing 12-month level now of 32.4% to a range of 33.5% to 34.5% for the whole year of 2023. So yes, third quarter, still a little bit depressed by the expense seasonality, but fourth quarter, very strong margins and expenses really low. That's the overall trend that you should expect for Market Intelligence and the other divisions.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.Thomas Colton RoeschThis is Tom Roesch on for Andrew Nicholas. I wanted to ask a question around AI. And I was curious about what your strategy is for allocating Kensho resources to assist with developing AI capabilities across the segments. Given S&amp;P's extensive portfolio, it seems like resources could be stretched in there. So I was wondering if you guys take more like a holistic approach, where there's universal capability across the segments developing AI, or if there are specific segments where you are focusing AI development.Douglas L. PetersonAndrew, let me start and then I'm going to hand it over to Ewout. I want to go back to a period 6 and 7 years ago when we first made our investment in Kensho in a round B, and we started thinking about what the future was going to look like. And we actually see that future playing right now. We felt that in 5 years from then, which is now, and 10 years from then, which is 5 years from now, that people like us would be making decisions assisted by artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. And in the last year or so, it's become apparent that there's another leg to that stool. It's not just artificial intelligence and machine learning, it's also generative AI. We've been embracing that across the company. Kensho has developed an expertise in different types of generative AI models. They're a go-to source in the company for learning about what we can do and what are the different models we could be applying. As you saw in our prepared remarks, we have a governance approach around AI, which is to ensure that we're always thinking about our customers. We have a hybrid methodology of philosophy about using multiple types of models and sources, whether that's internally driven from Kensho or the divisions or externally from open sources or from partnerships. When you look at the needs for developing AI solutions, you end up actually having to stack multiple models on top of each other. And you require really careful management of your data so that you can protect it as well as ensure that it will be then used and displayed in the right way. And then the third part of our governance is to ensure that we're all protecting our data. This is one of the first things we did when we started seeing generative AI models. We took a step back to make sure that we could protect our data and our IP. But let me hand it over to Ewout and then over to Edouard to talk a little bit more about some of the things we're seeing in the company.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenTom, one of the things that I am really excited about is that on the one hand, we have Kensho, which is a relatively small group but really an innovation accelerator within the company. And then we have all of our colleagues around the world because we have so many data scientists, technology engineers, data experts, experts in a lot of specific areas and fields around the company. And you have to bring all of those together in order to get the acceleration with the opportunities that generative AI and large language models are bringing for us as a company. So Kensho is focusing on a couple of areas that will have the biggest impact for the company as a whole. This could be use cases that we are developing. But also, think about collecting the data and structuring the data in token sets that are the best readable for large language models. And that's actually, from a technical perspective, a really important challenge. But the good thing is Kensho has been doing that kind of work already for the last 5 years. We have experience with working with AI for the last 5 years. We know how to prioritize this for the last 5 years. We know how to track the economic benefits. And we have been doing that for the last 5 years. So we have a lot of experience around dealing with this. And we're not trying to invent this for the first time at this moment. But then on the other hand, we also have the crowdsourcing. So we have a lot of colleagues that are contributing to these kind of initiatives to collect data for large language models and many other initiatives. And we are experimenting across the board. So let me hand it over to Edouard because there's also a lot of great experimentation and development going on in Mobility.Edouard TavernierThank you, Ewout. Thank you, Doug. And just to add to what you said, I want to bring up one example of how we're thinking about innovating at scale with a new technology like generative AI. And as Doug said, our experience in earlier forms of AI and our cloud investment over the past 2 years, I think, puts us in good stead to harness this new technology. But I think we have to recognize there's a step change here. And so as we think about how do we enable our organization, one of the big strengths of our strategy is to upskill our people and make sure we familiarize them with this technology. Earlier in July, within Mobility, we actually launched internal solution called [Autopilot], which is all about bringing the tool to hundreds of our colleagues within the Mobility division. And we've already seen dozens of use cases developed over the past 2 or 3 weeks. And we learn every day from this particular solution. We learn not just about large language models, but we learn about data curation. We learn about what kind of UIs do we need to develop, what kind of business governance do we need around it. And that's a great example of one of the ways in which, as an organization, we're learning and we're harnessing this new technology.OperatorOur next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.Craig Anthony HuberI'd like to hear more about your outlook for Ratings for the debt issuance for the year, please, if you can just kind of go into investment-grade, high-yield bank loans. And I'd particularly like to hear about if you're overly concerned of what's going on in the commercial real estate market, not so much what the impact is on the CMBS market. But if things continue to get worse there, do you think there could be some negative domino effects in the whole banking sector, financial sector out there?Douglas L. PetersonOkay. Thanks, Craig. Let me give you some color just on the issuance market generally and then dig into a couple of questions you asked. Overall, as you know, in the last quarter, the issuance was strong. It was up 8%, billed issuance including bank loans. Bank loans is actually quite weak during the quarter. But the -- we saw, on the other hand, a lot of volatility and a lot of lumpiness in that issuance. There were some characteristics of markets like corporates in the U.S. is up 80%. Overall investment grade globally was up 20%. It was up in the U.S., overall, it was up 19%, et cetera. And then overall, high yield was up 90% during the quarter. But on the other hand, structured credit, CLOs were down 46% in Europe, 42% in the U.S. So there's a lot of lumpiness in markets. And that has to do with uncertainty as to ratings, what's happening with interest rates, what's happening with inflation, yield, et cetera, spread. So there's a lot of market instability still out there. We saw yesterday the U.S. Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points. This morning, the ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points. So the markets are looking for some stability of rates and spreads and growth rates, et cetera. Now with that backdrop, let me give you what are a couple of the forecast that we have for the rest of the year. We've increased our range for billed issuance for the rest of the year from a range of 4% to 8%. The previous was 3% to 7% at the last quarter. And the quarter before that, it was actually 2% to 6%. So we've seen it improving throughout the year, what we expect for the rest of the year. And if you look at the -- what we're expecting for the rest of the year, if you look at the 4% to 8% and with the guidance range we just gave, it means that we're going to be growing in kind of the mid-double-digit range for the rest of the year in billed issuance. A couple of the different areas I can share with you. As you know, our Ratings research team produces forecasts and summaries of what they're going to see going forward. We use that as one of the inputs for billed issuance. It's a different methodology than the billed issuance, but I want to give you that information anyway. We see the corporates growing at about 13% for the rest of the year with a range between 5% and 20%; financial services, flat for the rest of the year with a range that could be down as much as 5%, up 4%; structured finance, down about 13% for the year with a range of down 18% to down 8%; and then U.S. public finance could be down about 5% with a range down 10% or up 2%. So these are the factors that we're using. We are expecting that once we see these factors I mentioned like inflation, interest rates, spreads, et cetera, as that starts to improve, we think we'll see a better outcome. One last thing I want to mention is M&amp;A. M&amp;A has been incredibly weak. This last quarter, second quarter, it was one of the weakest levels we've seen. It was as low as the second quarter of 2020, when we saw the beginning of the pandemic, when everything came to a halt. I've been speaking with a lot of banks to understand what their outlook is for M&amp;A because that's a big driver of levered loans of the lending market, of the high-yield market, et cetera. We're seeing from the bankers that we're speaking with that they're expecting that at the end of this year and into the first quarter of next year, they're expecting that M&amp;A will pick up again as the market conditions improve. They've told me that there's a pretty large backlog and big pipeline waiting to -- for people to start doing deals. But it's not happening as long as there's still some uncertainty in the markets. So thanks, Craig. Thanks for the question.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.Alexander Eduard Maria HessThis is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I just wanted to just ask about the adjusted expense maybe sort of cadence for the year. You guys spoke to incentive comp being elevated year-on-year in 2Q. Maybe what does that look like for the back half of the year? And then also, if you could maybe more qualitatively flesh out what went into core investment growth and overall compensation expense, that would be very helpful.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenThanks, Alex. Just generally, I would like to say expenses are under control. They are in line with expectations. And we expect the overall expense growth for the full year to be relatively modest. So let me give you a little bit more color around this. So the key driver of the expense growth this quarter was a swing in the incentive compensation that we already discussed. As I mentioned, we also expect that to create elevated expenses in the third quarter. And then we will see it significantly coming down in the fourth quarter. We still expect to hit our margin targets for this year. And as I said before, I think it's also maybe good to point that overall, we're looking at expenses in absolute dollars that are on a declining trend. So we have now seen 2 quarters in a row that, in absolute dollars, our expense is coming down. And actually, the third quarter, we expect sequentially further that our expenses will be down relative to the second quarter. So very much in line with expectations. Your question about what is going into the growth bucket? It's a couple of areas that go in the growth bucket. The first is our strategic investment spend. So that is the $150 million budget that we have for this year to invest in some of our key initiatives to drive future growth. The second is the additional spend with respect to cloud and also the additional usage of GPUs for our gen AI developments that we are buying from our cloud providers. And then the third, that is the BAU growth. So these are costs related to BAU growth. Think, for example, about additional data that we have to purchase for additional product development within our divisions. So those elements go into the growth bucket. But overall, we don't see that really as an expense. We see that as an investment in the future and future growth for our businesses.OperatorOur next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.Owen LauSo I have a quick follow-up to your AI strategy. One of the competitors has partnered with Microsoft. Could you please talk about the plus and minus of using an in-house AI compared to outsourcing it to a large tech firm, why in-house AI, such as Kensho or the hybrid approach, fits into S&amp;P overall strategy?Douglas L. PetersonYes. Thank you, Owen. And this is something we thought a lot about. And as I started my last comment a few minutes ago, we've been thinking about the AI strategy for over 7 years. This isn't something that we're just jumping into right now. We've had a lot of experience of how we can use AI not only as a productivity tool but also as a tool to drive growth and new product ideas. We've also been developing our datasets. And as you recall, at the same time when we acquired Kensho, we also came up with the Marketplace. And the Marketplace now has over 225 tiles, which have information and data, which not only can markets use in new ways, we can also use that. So we've been on an approach to cleaning up our data, making it usable. And we feel that the need for -- as I used the word before, stacking different capabilities and solutions as models, is going to be the way that you can deliver the most valuable insights and solutions to our customers. As an example, you might need to take your data and turn it from being raw data into something that can be used by a model to learn or to be used in order to develop a new application. That data might -- the application might then need a different application on top of it so that the customer can use it. So it has capabilities to be able to use in spreadsheets, to be downloaded, to search on it, et cetera. So we feel that there's a need to have multiple applications. And that's why the hybrid approach is the one that we're going to be pursuing. That doesn't mean that we're not going to work with some of the providers that you just described. We already have a really strong relationship with AWS in our cloud strategy. They're developing a really compelling AI strategy. We've been using over the past, NVIDIA chips. We were one of the first groups that ever were using them in the way they're being used now for AI. We have a really strong relationship with Microsoft. There's also open tools that are being used. We also have people developing our own LLM model. So we think that we can use this. We think that we have a really good network of people across the company that Ewout just described that are using different types of models. So we believe that we can have governance, we can have controls. We've had controls in place for the last 5 years since we've owned Kensho to manage and track everything we're doing in AI. We're going to continue to use that same discipline for everything we're doing in AI to make sure that we're also controlling where we're investing and how we're moving forward. So it's our belief that a hybrid model is the right one for us and something that's going to create the most value for our shareholders.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.Jeffrey P. MeulerEdouard, Ewout said, I think, in the description of Mobility growth that there was new store growth for CARFAX new subscription products. That's always a little surprising to me but good to hear, given that I think of it as a more penetrated product. So just maybe if you can give us some color there, is this further penetration of the heritage products? Is it something in terms of innovation or new versions of the used car products that are going through an upgrade cycle? And then just any other growth drivers you want to highlight for CARFAX. I think there was a call-out of the service line opportunity on CARFAX for Life.Edouard TavernierThanks, Jeff. So I'll -- I can give you quite a simple answer to that question. You're right that we work with most dealerships in North America. We work with most global OEMs and we work with most suppliers. So in that sense, we feel quite penetrated because we have relationships with most of the potential customers out there. But we also have a portfolio of offerings, whether it's at CARFAX, Mastermind or elsewhere. And within that portfolio, we have more mature offerings. But we have lots of fairly young offerings which have been developed over the past 5 or 6 years and which have a lot of mark-to-market penetration to go. So if you take a look at the examples that Ewout mentioned, products like CARFAX for Life, used car listings, Mastermind or supply chain and technology are all products which have a huge amount of runway ahead of them, right? They're still younger products. They're evolving very fast. And we have a long way to go before we get to full penetration. So think of -- so if I take a step back and now think about those secular drivers, think of them as follows. We have a lot of product innovation. And from a commercial execution, we have a lot of white space with all of these offerings we've developed over the past 5 or 6 years, which are maybe 30%, 40%, 50% penetrated. And then we have all of these secular tailwinds, which are those massive disruptions going on in the industry, which are creating demand for information. And we see we're very well positioned to capture that demand.OperatorOur last question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn.Russell QuelchA question on fixed income indices, please. Given you have lots of data on corporate debt at the point of issuance and you now own an incumbent brand in the space post the IHS acquisition and the underlying market for benchmarking fixed income is accelerating as we see sort of greater participation in that space, do you see this as a major opportunity for S&amp;P Global? And perhaps if so, can you talk about what you're doing to invest behind that opportunity and the speed at which you think that can start delivering increased revenue growth and the degree to which it influences your 10% medium-term growth ambition for Indices?Douglas L. PetersonYes. Thank you, Russell. Thanks for joining the call today. We -- if you take a step back, and one of the key drivers of our merger with IHS Markit was to look at what we think is happening with the transformation of capital markets globally. As you know, in the U.S., the capital markets for corporate financing is somewhere north of 70% and the market is probably even higher than that. In Europe, it's probably only about 35%, maybe 40% at the most. And across Asia, it's in the 20% range. We think that, that transition of capital markets globally is going to continue. We see the United States has a very sophisticated set of institutional investors that can go across the entire stack of capital. In Europe, we're starting to see more of that. In fact, one of the signals, which is positive for a business in Europe, is the withdrawal of liquidity programs like the LTRO from the central bank, from the ECB. We're also known now with the combination of the products and services. Starting with Market Intelligence, we have the data services from DVA, which provide prices on over 13 million securities, loans, swaps, other types of fixed income products and loans. That's a really incredible set of data, which we've now added into Capital IQ Pro. And that kind of data is used by the markets. We have the ability to expand into private credit as well. The private credit asset class is right now about $1.5 trillion, of which $1 trillion is probably out in the market in place. And there's another $500 billion which is dry powder, which is going to be available as that asset class continues to grow. We have ways we can serve that. So if I look across the entire stack of capital, but let's now look only at the debt and credit side, in the debt and credit side, we have credit ratings. We have private information, private market information. We've got pricing information about bonds and loans and swaps. We also are now covering the issuance with issuance data. We have Wall Street Office, WSO, which is supporting the underlying -- underwriting of loans, et cetera. So we have -- we are covering products, data services, software services across the entire stack of debt and credit. And finally, also in our index business that you asked about, we also have a set of credit products, iTraxx, CDX, et cetera, that are providing information for the markets. And we can use those for Indices. And we're seeing opportunities there not only in the fixed income indices themselves but also extending into ESG fixed income indices as well as multi-asset class indices. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who can supplement some of what I just said.Ewout Lucien SteenbergenYes. Let me give you a couple of additional data points in addition to what Doug said. If you think about the expenses for the index business, actually this is the only division where the growth initiatives were a little bit higher than the incentive compensation we said. And that's for a good reason. Because as Doug highlighted, there are so many areas of growth initiatives in our index business. Think about fixed income data that we can sell together with the indices itself, multi-asset class, sustainability, factor-based thematics, Kensho and so on and so forth. But the most important thing here is, as we have told you at our Investor Day, this is going to be a business that we are committed to deliver double-digit growth in '25 and 2026 at a level of margins in the high 60s. So of course, phenomenal outlook for this business, given all the growth initiatives. So we think it's the right thing to do to invest into this business line, both in fixed income but also many of the other categories that I just mentioned.Douglas L. PetersonThank you, Russell. And I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and your excellent questions. And I also want to thank Edouard for joining us today. I'm so excited about the progress that we're making at S&amp;P Global and our focus on growth and innovation, which you heard about. I'm thrilled that we're at the forefront of AI and gen AI and that we've got Kensho that's going to help lead us and bring that together. I'm also very excited that we're the center of what's happening in global markets and in particular, sustainability and energy transition. This is something that's changing every day. And we're having the most important dialogues and building the products and solutions that people need. And as always, I want to thank our people. I feel fortunate that this year, I've been able to travel again and I've been meeting with our people in Tokyo, Dubai, London and Denver. And I'm always inspired by their passion and their commitment to S&amp;P Global. And I'm always impressed by their great work. So again, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. And I hope that everybody gets a chance to enjoy the rest of the summer, and have a great day. Thank you so much.OperatorThank you. That concludes this morning's call.

161,f5e1aac9-647d-379e-a5e5-553563478fa9,TSN,2023-07-28,15 Worst Countries in the World for Vegetarians,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-worst-countries-world-vegetarians-165532053.html,1690476932,STORY,"['BYND', 'TSN', 'MCD']","[In this article, we will give you a heads up on which countries will give you limited food choices if you are a vegetarian and why it is so. If you want to skip our overview of the growing interest in vegetarianism and veganism, read 8 Worst Countries in the World For Vegetarians. While vegetarianism is gaining traction, there are still some of the worst countries in the world for vegetarians where food choices are restrictive. For instance, China is one of the most difficult countries for vegetarians because even if a certain Chinese dish doesn't contain meat, it might have animal-based products like lard. Similarly, Argentina is renowned for its meat-based cuisine and is notoriously difficult for vegetarians. As the world's second-largest beef consumer, Argentine culinary traditions often revolve around asado, a type of barbeque, making it difficult to find varied vegetarian options. Mongolia's extreme climate also necessitates a diet heavy on animal-based food, such as mutton and beef, so vegans and vegetarians face a hard time finding appropriate food in the country.Which Country Is Mostly Vegetarian?India has the largest percentage of vegetarians amongst its population, as 24% of people in the country have veg diets. Major religions practiced in India, such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, promote vegetarianism as a spiritual practice. Also, vegetarianism has deep roots in Indian society and is associated with notions of purity, non-violence, and holistic health. We have already discussed 20 Countries With the Highest Rates Of Vegetarians; go through our list to know where veg food preferences are the most prevalent.Growing Popularity of Vegetarian and Vegan DietsThe vegetarian industry is gaining mainstream acceptance as more consumers shift towards plant-based diets due to health, environmental, and ethical concerns. The global vegetarian food market is valued at $52.5 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $95.5 billion by 2029. Story continuesLikewise, the global vegan food market, which comprises meat substitutes, dairy alternatives, and vegetarian meals, was valued at $23.3 billion in 2020. According to a report from Fortune Business Insights, the vegan market is forecasted to reach $61.35 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 12.95% between 2021-2028. Such high forecasted growth indicates a strong demand for plant-based products and purely vegan food alternatives.Consumer behavior impacts this expanding industry. A study by Ipsos MORI in 2018 revealed that approximately 5% of the world's population identified as vegetarian, while 3% of people were pure vegan. The percentages are expected to rise, given the trend towards plant-based diets. The report found that the younger population is more likely to follow a meat-free diet, while older people are mostly omnivorous. Also, interestingly, women prefer vegetarian and vegan food options more than men. Statista's Consumer Insights of 2023 also found that 86% of respondents surveyed in 21 countries had meat-containing diets.The veg industry's expansion is also fueled by companies developing innovative products to make plant-based diets more accessible and appealing. For example, Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) has made significant strides in the creation of meat substitutes that mimic the taste, texture, and nutritional profile of animal products. These products by Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) offer good taste without the environmental and ethical issues associated with livestock farming. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) 's plant-based meat substitutes help new vegetarians and vegans satiate their cravings while keeping their diet meat-free. Moreover, traditional food companies and restaurants are adopting more inclusive strategies to cater to vegetarians. Fast-food giants like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), KFC, and Burger King now offer plant-based options. For instance, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) 's Double McPlant Burger uses 2 Beyond Meat patties, a vegan sandwich sauce, and a vegan cheese alternative. Likewise, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) 's Vegetable Deluxe burger uses vegetables along with a vegan sandwich sauce. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) is also investing heavily in its vegetarian product lines to become more inclusive for varying food preferences. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) also announced plans to launch plant-based products in select markets in Asia-Pacific, which includes products like plant-based nuggets, bites, and filets. This expansion underlines Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) 's recognition of the increasing global appetite for plant-based alternatives.However, the vegetarian food industry's rapid growth also prompts questions about the global food industry's adaptability and sustainability. Challenges like insufficient protein content in plant-based food, maintaining taste, and overcoming cultural and perceptual barriers to adoption limit the industry's expansion. Despite these, the industry's projected growth signifies a shift in global food systems as people are becoming more conscious about what they consume and the companies they are associated with.Which Country is 100% Non Vegetarian?As per our findings, there's no country where 100% of the population is non-vegetarian. However, some countries have a higher consumption of meat because of cultural or religious factors, i.e., China, Brazil, and the USA, among others. Some Asian nations have high meat consumption rates, but others, like India, have significant vegetarian populations due to cultural and religious factors. Also, many Muslim-majority nations consume a lot of meat, especially during certain religious holidays, but there are also vegetarian and vegan individuals in these countries.Similarly, the United States, Australia, and Argentina are the top meat consumers per capita. However, this does not mean these countries are 100% non-vegetarian, as dietary habits are diverse and complex.As people's environmental and ethical concerns are changing their food choices, some countries still follow their carnivorous diets; learn about the Top 20 Countries with the Highest Meat Consumption.Let's now move toward the worst countries for vegetarians. 15 Worst Countries in the World for Vegetarians15 Worst Countries in the World for VegetariansOur MethodologyWe selected the worst countries in the world for vegetarians based on their prevalent cuisine preferences and meat consumption. For instance, if a country has substantial meat consumption, it hints that vegetarian food is not common in the country. When a nation's religious and cultural inclination is towards carnivorous cuisine, vegetarians have a hard time finding meat-free food there. Similarly, countries like South Korea and Japan have extensive shorelines, so naturally, their food revolves around seafood. So based on our understanding of different regions' eating habits, here are the worst countries for vegetarians:15. MongoliaMongolia's traditional cuisine is heavily based on meat and dairy, as the country's historical lifestyle was nomadic, which required nutrient-dense food sources. The country's harsh winters make vegetable cultivation challenging, and there's a heavy reliance on animal products for sustenance. The Mongolian diet features mutton, beef, and horse meat, evidenced by the per capita meat consumption of 102 kgs per year. Vegetarian options are not typically part of the traditional fare, which can make Mongolia one of the worst countries in the world for vegetarians.14. IcelandLike Mongolia, the climate in Iceland results in a diet high in seafood and lamb. As the country has volcanic terrain and harsh winters, growing produce isn't typical in Iceland. Icelandic specialties like wind-dried fish and smoked lamb are staples, whereas vegetarian alternatives are often imported and can be expensive. Furthermore, cultural dining occasions such as ""Þorrablót"" are about consuming various types of preserved meat. Such carnivorous inclination may limit options for vegetarians, as finding a meat-free diet will take some research.13. LatviaLatvia's cuisine is influenced by its Baltic climate and agricultural abundance. The diet includes pork, potatoes, and rye bread, with a lesser emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables. Dishes like breaded pork cutlets and sausages are commonplace, while vegetarianism is less prevalent. Although Latvia's urban areas are seeing an increase in vegetarian and vegan options, more common eateries in rural areas may not offer a wide range of plant-based dishes. 12. UruguayUruguay is renowned for its asado barbecue, and beef is an essential part of virtually every traditional dish in the country. Uruguayans have one of the highest per-capita meat consumption rates in the world, standing at 53 kgs. Although urban areas like Montevideo are beginning to offer more vegetarian options, much of its cuisine makes it one of the worst countries in the world for vegetarians.11. PortugalPortugal heavily favors seafood and meat in its cuisine. Iconic dishes like salted cod, bean stew with pork, and suckling pig dominate local menus. Vegetarian alternatives can be scarce, especially in rural areas. Despite a slowly growing vegetarian culture in larger cities like Lisbon, many traditional eateries in Portugal may not offer substantial plant-based options. Almost 1.2% of the country's population is vegetarian, so naturally, pure veg food options are limited for visitors or natives who want to eat a meat-free diet.10. PhilippinesThe Philippines has a cuisine deeply rooted in meat and seafood. The concept of vegetarianism is not widely recognized in the country, and many dishes may contain hidden animal products like fish sauce, shrimp paste, or chicken stock. Moreover, the per capita annual meat consumption in the Philippines is 33.74 kgs, one of the highest in the world. 9. South AfricaIn South Africa, the traditional cuisine is largely meat-centric, and the country's per capita meat consumption is 59.77 kgs. The popular 'Braai' culture, similar to Western-style barbecues, is deeply embedded in the South African lifestyle and is the cuisine's focal point. Additionally, the country's culinary landscape reflects a strong presence of meat in the national palate and may limit vegetarian options.Click to continue reading 8 Worst Countries in the World For Vegetarians.Suggested Articles:Vegetable Consumption per Capita by Country10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Buy20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Worst Countries in the World For Vegetarians is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"
162,25fada1f-cad6-3807-a7e9-cadf42e40d62,TSN,2023-07-28,UPDATE 1-Bird-flu bans on US poultry exports persist even as cases subside,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-bird-flu-bans-us-163008166.html,1690475408,STORY,['TSN'],"[(Adds comment from Pilgrim's Pride CEO in paragraphs 4-5)By Tom PolansekCHICAGO, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. poultry producers say they face prolonged economic pain from avian flu despite going months without infections in flocks, as China and some smaller importers fail to lift trade bans implemented during the nation's worst-ever outbreak of the virus.The lingering bans, imposed last year to prevent the spread of the disease, constrain the $6 billion U.S. export market for poultry meat as producers also grapple with limited labor, lower chicken prices and uncertain costs for feed.The Chinese market is particularly important for U.S. companies because it is the primary destination for items like chicken feet that Americans generally do not eat, industry officials said.Pilgrim's Pride CEO Fabio Sandri warned on Thursday that Beijing may extend its ban even as other countries resume trade. Mostly owned by JBS SA, the company is one of the world's largest chicken producers.""Other than China, we expect to see further easing of export restrictions during Q3,"" Sandri said on an earnings call.China, South Africa and the Dominican Republic each maintain bans on poultry from 37 states that previously reported infections, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) records show.Mexico, the top overall market for American poultry meat, has largely lifted trade bans, though shipments from Colorado, Washington state and counties in a few other states are blocked, records show.China's failure to lift bans 90 days after states eliminate avian flu from farms violates the Phase 1 trade agreement signed with former President Donald Trump in 2020, industry officials said.The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office declined to comment and China's General Administration of Customs did not respond to a request for comment.The USDA had no updated comment. It said last year it was committed to ensuring restrictions are in line with international agreements and lifted as quickly as possible.Story continuesWayne-Sanderson Farms, the third-largest U.S. poultry producer, told Reuters many of its facilities are in states that should have been reapproved for exports months ago.""China continues to be less than forthcoming when it comes to state reapprovals,"" the company said. ""We have opportunity losses that are in the millions of dollars between white meat, dark meat and paws.""U.S. exports of chicken feet, or paws, to China are down 27% by volume through May, after rising in 2022, USDA data show.Chicken producers Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods have also highlighted trade restrictions. Tyson reports quarterly earnings Aug. 7.""Several key countries have not yet returned to normal patterns of business with the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement to Reuters. ""We are eager for our industry's long-standing business relationships to resume.""Avian flu has disrupted trade globally as the virus spread. Japan this summer suspended poultry purchases from two states in Brazil, the world's largest chicken exporter, after cases in backyard animals.Under guidelines from the World Organization for Animal Health, regional or national trade bans are applicable if the highly lethal virus infects a commercial farm.United Nations agencies have said global outbreaks in poultry raise concerns the virus might adapt to infect humans more easily.NEARLY $1 BLN EXPORT HITThe U.S. outbreak began last year and has wiped out nearly 59 million chickens, turkeys and other birds. The last infection in a commercial flock was in April, though, and some states facing export restrictions have not detected commercial cases since 2022, USDA data show.Export losses from the outbreak total $895 million, the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council said on Tuesday. That is down from $1.3 billion for the previous record outbreak in 2015, after the U.S. convinced trading partners to narrow trade restrictions.The council, an industry group, said USDA sent China reports requesting it end restrictions on 14 states, including major producers North Carolina and Arkansas.""They haven't budged on it,"" said Greg Tyler, council president.In a March report, the USTR said the government submitted reports to China for states deemed to be free of avian flu. The Phase 1 trade pact requires China to resume imports within five days of receiving the information, the report said.U.S. industry officials suspect China's delay is political amid heightened tensions with Washington.States saddled with trade bans, including Texas and Maryland, said they sought information from USDA.""We're certainly concerned about not being able to export our products when we know we've got a good clean product,"" Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in an interview.(Reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago.

Good morning, everyone. So starting with the big picture. Our momentum continued into the second quarter with net revenue up 15% and operating income up 16%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, once again demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our business. Consumer spending has remained resilient with spend on experiences and travel remaining a focus.On the macroeconomic front, we continue to monitor a number of factors. First, the overall labor market remains strong, including wage growth, and consumers continue to be supported by credit and savings. These are key factors of consumer spending. Second, the efforts of central banks to curb inflation are showing signs of progress. Despite this, inflation remains elevated, and we are in a period of tight monetary policy across many countries. Economic growth will continue to vary country by country and sector by sector.Looking at our switched volume trends. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. We continue to see strength in T&amp;E with some recent moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets. Cross-border travel continues to show strength, reaching 154% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this trend with our travel-oriented portfolios and our initiatives in areas like loyalty and marketing. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well. We're monitoring the environment closely and are ready to adjust investment levels as appropriate while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these priorities are: one, expanding in payments; two, extending our services; and three, embracing new networks.First, we're expanding in payments by continuing to win deals with a diverse set of customers, powering growth and acceptance, capturing a prioritized set of new payment flows, and exploring new ways to ensure payment choice by leveraging multiple alternatives, including card rails, ACH, blockchain and open banking.Back to the top of this list. We are winning deals across the globe through a combination of our innovative products, differentiated services and our solution-selling approach. I'll share a few examples from each region. Let's start in Europe, where we announced a significant win with UniCredit across all card products. We expanded our partnership and put in place a first-of-its-kind, single-card, multi-market strategy spanning 13 banks, 12 markets and 20 million cards. UniCredit selected Mastercard due to our innovative digital capabilities, shared focus on sustainability and proven ability to support their client needs.In Germany, the previously announced conversion of approximately 10 million of Deutsche Bank's credit and debit cards to Mastercard has now started. These wins build on our prior success in the U.K., where there are now 16 million NatWest Debit Mastercards live in market. When combined with the Santander and First Direct migrations, approximately 27 million debit cards have now shifted to Mastercard across these 3 portfolios in the U.K.Turning to North America. Mastercard will partner with Fiserv's money network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. Up north, Coast Capital, Canada's largest Federal credit union, will be converting their consumer and small business portfolios to Mastercard. The partnership highlights our shared commitment to local communities with issuance through Collabria Financial Services. In addition, we have a new agreement with Tim Hortons, the largest quick-service restaurant brand in Canada. Tim Hortons will launch a new Mastercard credit card and will be using a broad set of Mastercard's digital, analytics and fraud services and technologies.Our relationship with Santander in Latin America continues to grow. In Mexico, we established a long-term exclusive deal with Openbank, their new digital bank. We also renewed the Fiesta Rewards co-brand credit card, Santander's key offering within their consumer portfolio. In Brazil, we will be Santander's exclusive partner across their commercial portfolio. And we've expanded our partnership with fast-growing Sicredi, one of Brazil's largest credit unions. In Asia Pacific, we've extended our relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, which will enable us to grow our consumer credit presence across key markets in the region. We've also expanded our partnership with HSBC through the launch of the Travel One Card in Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. Travel One will provide instant in-app rewards redemption powered by the Mastercard Rewards system.With all of these cards, people do need a place to use them. We continue to power growth and acceptance by establishing new partnerships and scaling new technologies. This quarter, we announced partnerships with both Alipay and WeChat Pay to enable international travelers to easily link any Mastercard credit or debit card to Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets. The partnership allows visitors to make payments with tens of millions of QR code merchants across China. I just returned from China, where I saw firsthand how this is helping international travelers shop and pay in more places in a simple way. It's like paying like a local. And this will be valuable as inbound cross-border travel to China improves from approximately 50% of 2019 levels in the second quarter.In the online environment, we are scaling our Click to Pay capability to enhance the guest checkout experience. Click to Pay transactions grew over 70% year-over-year in the second quarter, and the technology is now live in 30 markets. In the quarter, we added Chile, Bahrain and Slovakia. And NatWest Group became the first bank in the U.K. to go live with Click to Pay push provisioning for cardholders.Shifting to New Payment Flows. We are making tangible progress in this area. In commercial point of sale, we've extended our partnership with Brex to support the international expansion of their commercial portfolios. We expanded our relationship with myPOS continuing to drive new merchant acceptance across more than 30 European markets while also migrating their small business debit portfolio to Mastercard. And we've established an exclusive partnership with Australian lender, Grow Finance, to introduce credit cards to their small business customers later this year.In B2B accounts payable, we remain the market leaders in virtual card. We continue to drive growth by tapping into new use cases. For example, we established an exclusive partnership with EasyTransfer in Greater China. This competitive flip leverages our virtual card capabilities to support cross-border tuition payments for international students.We're also making it easy for buyers and suppliers to integrate virtual cards into the technology platforms they already use. Building on our prior announcements with SAP and Coupa, we've recently partnered with GEP to integrate our virtual card technology into their payables platform.And on the supplier side, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager with Billtrust. The solution streamlines the processing of virtual card transactions for suppliers and automates the integration of reconciliation data into accounts receivable systems. This is a great solution. And it builds on partnerships with companies like Boost Payment Solutions, who have been working closely with Mastercard to expand and optimize commercial acceptance.And finally, in new flows, we continue to deploy our disbursement and remittances capabilities in new ways and across new geographies. In the U.S., we partner with top sports gaming processor, Interchecks, who will make Mastercard Send available to gaming operators for payouts.Careem Pay, one of the largest digital wallets in UAE, will use Send to top up their wallets using Mastercard. And on the cross-border front, we partnered with Al Fardan Exchange in Qatar to facilitate remittance services and support cross-border travel.Our work in real-time ACH continues to support these new flows. Our circular approach has been to expand our infrastructure reach into new markets. Going forward, we will be focusing on delivering and scaling in the markets we already are serving while building applications and services in these key locations, in line with our overall strategic and financial objectives.And in blockchain, we're introducing the MasterCard Multi-Token Network, MTN. MTN is a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within digital asset and blockchain ecosystems, more secure, scalable and interoperable. We believe in the potential of blockchain technologies. However, regulated money, such as bank deposits and CBDCs, need to be part of the solution, and they should interoperate with traditional systems.We can help with that. MTN is the natural evolution of the work we have already done in this space. The initial sandbox will kick off in the U.K. this summer.Now turning to services. Our services inform decision-making of our customers. They help them create stronger connections and greater loyalty. Payments and services reinforce each other, multiplying our impact and the value we deliver to all our partners. Our services help many -- drive many of the wins I mentioned earlier. So here are a few additional examples.We recently launched our Consumer Fraud Risk solution, which leverages our latest AI capabilities and the unique network view of real-time payments I just mentioned to help banks predict and prevent payment scams. AI is a foundational technology used across our business and has been a game changer in helping identify such fraud patterns. We've partnered with 9 U.K. banks, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Monzo and TSB to stop scam payments before funds leave a victim's account.TSB, one of the first banks to adopt the solution, indicated that it has already dramatically increased its fraud detection since deploying the capability.We're combining our loyalty, consulting, analytics and identity services in different ways to help our customers capitalize on the travel recovery. This quarter, we extended our broad-based partnership with Expedia Group. Together, we will combine Mastercard's loyalty solution with Expedia's extensive travel supply to enable Mastercard cardholders to book travel using loyalty points.We also partnered with Thomas Cook in India to issue prepaid cards for international travel. The proposition includes cardholder access to over 450 cross-border travel offers through Mastercard Travel Rewards.And earlier this month, I met with our partners at Deutsche Bank and Lufthansa in Frankfurt. We resigned our long-standing partnerships with Lufthansa Group for its Miles &amp; More loyalty program and welcomed Deutsche Bank as the new issuing partner. In this enhanced relationship, you will see a combination of our loyalty solutions, personalization capabilities and digital user experiences help the partnership take off to the next level using airlines peak.We're also leveraging our personalization in Test &amp; Learn capabilities to help our partners across the ecosystem enhance the customer experience and improve acquisition and conversion rates. For example, the combined Dynamic Yields personalization capabilities with our marketing services to drive digital customer acquisition for Ecobank in Nigeria.In addition, HP Inc. has partnered with us to deploy personalized bank content for their consumers across Canada and Europe. And on the merchant side, we are working with 7-Eleven in Australia using our Test &amp; Learn capabilities to support their rollout of new store concepts and evolve its food and beverage offerings.Our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks with a focus on open banking and digital identity. We continued to make progress in open banking and established a series of new and expanded collaborations this quarter, including ones with Freddie Mac, Algon based out of France and Dapi in the UAE. These entities will leverage our smart and consumer permission data to drive increased financial inclusion and make digital interaction simpler and safer.Turning to digital identity. We're driving adoption across several new verticals, including travel, ticketing, retail and financial institutions. Travel provider, FlightHub, is using our identity solutions to help travelers book their new next adventure. Sports teams across the U.S., including the New Jersey Devils, use these solutions to enable fans to buy tickets while reducing fraud on ticketing platforms. Major League Baseball used our NuDetect technology to ensure that All-Star votes were authentic for this year's All-Star game.In retail, we partner with IKEA, who is using Ekata to help reduce friction and fraud. And financial institutions like Greenwood, a digital banking platform for Black and Latinx communities are using our capabilities to authenticate consumers in real time, making financial empowerment a reality for more people.So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, supported by resilient consumer spending, particularly in travel and experiences. Our strong deal momentum continues with new wins and expanded relationships powered by our services across a range of partners, including UniCredit, Fiserv, Tim Hortons, Brex and many more. Our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy positions us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead.Sachin, over to you.Sachin MehraThanks, Michael. So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15%, reflecting resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel as well as the continued growth in our value-added services and solutions.Operating expenses increased 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 16%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased 11% and 14%, respectively, both reflecting a sizable discrete tax expense this quarter related to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil.EPS of $2.89 includes a $0.22 reduction due to the discrete tax expense I just mentioned and an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $497 million through July 24, 2023.So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 12% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 6% with credit growth of 8% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 16% with credit growth of 14% and debit growth of 17%.Of note, we have now completed the NatWest debit migration in the U.K.Overall, cross-border volume increased 24% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. While this is sequentially lower versus Q1, this is due to tougher comps as we opened up post-Omicron last year. When you look at the trend versus 2019, you see continued strength. For example, cross-border travel is at 154% of 2019 levels in Q2, which is up 6 ppt from the prior quarter.On the same basis, cross-border card-not-present excluding travel continues to hold up well in relation to 2019 levels, up 2 ppt from the prior quarter to 210%.Turning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 17% year-over-year in Q2. Both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remained strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents over 60% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. Turning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the second quarter, which came in above our expectations. As a reminder, earlier this year, we revised our disaggregated revenue disclosure. Net revenues are now broken down into 2 new categories: payment network and value-added services and solutions. Now getting into the numbers described on a currency-neutral basis. Payment network net revenue increased 15% primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Payment network net revenue was higher than anticipated primarily due to higher revenues related to FX volatility and the timing of planned deal activity.Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16% primarily due to the continued healthy growth of our Cyber &amp; Intelligence solutions driven by our underlying driver growth and the demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for consulting and marketing services, which was partially offset by other solutions.Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 11%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 29%, while cross-border volumes increased 24%. The 5 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.Transaction processing assessments were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 17%. The 1 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments related to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees were $270 million this quarter. As a reminder, these other network assessments may fluctuate from period to period. Moving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13% primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives.Now turning to Page 9. Let me first comment on the operating metrics trends in the second quarter. Versus 2019, overall spending has remained resilient. When viewed year-over-year on a sequential basis, we are seeing some moderation in both inflation and spend in select international markets as well as more difficult comps.As it relates to the first 3 weeks of July, our metrics are holding up well, generally in line with Q2 when indexed to 2019. Just for your information, we have included all the data points from this schedule excluding activity from Russian-issued cards from current and prior periods in the appendix.Turning to Page 10. I want to share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Let me start by saying that our business fundamentals continue to remain strong as overall consumer spending remains healthy and we continue to deepen our relationships with partners across the globe.Domestic spending patterns have broadly normalized postpandemic. Cross-border travel continues to grow at a healthy pace, now above 150% of 2019 levels. While the travel recovery has progressed well in most regions, there remain pockets of opportunity, notably into and out of China. We remain well positioned to capitalize on this continued growth with our travel-oriented portfolios and related service offerings. Cross-border card-not-present ex travel continues to hold up well.While we are monitoring a number of macro and geopolitical factors, our base case scenario for the year continues to assume consumer spending remains resilient, buoyed by strong labor market and reflects current spending dynamics and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel.For the year, our outlook is broadly unchanged. We expect net revenue growth for the full year 2023 to remain in the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. As a reminder, this growth rate would have been approximately 1.5 ppt higher if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022.Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of 1 ppt for the year, and we expect a minimal impact from acquisitions. Our expectations for operating expense for the year are also unchanged with growth expected to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add about 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the year. As Michael mentioned, we are prepared to proactively adjust our operating expenses if we see meaningful changes to top line growth.With respect to the third quarter, year-over-year net revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Coming off a strong Q2, this sequentially reflects a lower anticipated contribution to growth from revenues related to FX volatility.Foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 3 ppt, and acquisitions are not expected to have much of an impact for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q3 growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add approximately 0 to 1 ppt to this growth, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 ppt.Other items to keep in mind. First, on the other income and expense line, we forecast an expense of approximately $90 million for Q3. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Second, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of between 18% and 19% for Q3 and Q4 based on the current geographic mix of our business and the recent U.S. tax guidance that allows for more tax credits to be claimed related to 2022 and 2023.And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.Devin CorrThank you, Sachin. Audra, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.Tien-Tsin HuangJust want to ask on the UniCredit win there. That was a nice one just outside of the top 10, it looks like, in Europe. So you mentioned a multi-market strategies what they're going after, and I heard sustainability also as a reason for the win. I'm just curious, thinking about this as a case study, is this a new trend? Why are they employing the strategy now in the wake of a lot of the macro uncertainty, open banking, and there was a lot of talk about pan-European schemes and whatnot. So I'm -- just wanted to study this a little bit and if there's any comments on timing pricing as well.Michael MiebachRight. Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. So this is a fantastic win. We're excited about that. As I laid out, it's very unique. This is a pan-European bank, so cutting across 13 banks in 12 markets. It's a wide strategy. Therefore, it's single card, multi-market and it cuts across a lot of our digital capabilities. So I think the breadth of our offering on the digital-first side as well as our services are a key aspect of us winning this particular portfolio.The sustainability part, we see this across a whole range of customers who are all looking at climate as the question of the century to solve, what can be done, the consumption question in the context of payments. There's so many angles to it. Our Priceless Planet Coalition on tree planting itself plays into that. So that is particularly important to UniCredit. So here again, we had a meeting of the minds.In the end, it comes down to as part of the migration, and you alluded to this in your question, do we stand ready to serve their needs from day 1 as the migration starts. We have proven this with Deutsche Bank, we've proven it with NatWest and so forth. So this is something that is not new to us. So we're excited to see this unfold over the near future.OperatorWe'll go next to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.Harshita RawatMichael, I want to ask about FedNow, which is now finally launched. I know you've commented on this before, and it's very early days and far from any sort of ubiquity or potential retail payment use cases. But you've had also a lot of experience working alongside real-time payments rails owning some TAM. So how are you thinking about FedNow and the risk (inaudible) involved.Michael MiebachThanks, Harshita. Yes, we're all monitoring what FedNow is doing. They are now going live. So this is clearly a milestone, a good opportunity to look at this topic again. Yes, our view on this really hasn't changed. So in the end, it comes down to what problem you are trying to solve. What are merchants looking for? Merchants are looking for reach to consumers. So scale matters. What are consumers looking for? Consumers are looking for safe ways to pay in a predictable fashion, ubiquity available. So those are all factors that haven't changed with this launch.We built that acceptance. We have a brand, the 2 interlocking circles that represent trust so that addresses a lot of what merchants and consumers are looking for. And we strengthened the position -- the proposition over years, contactless, Tap on Phone, buy now, pay later, Mastercard Installments, Click to Pay and so forth. So that's good. The Mastercard debit proposition is strong, and we keep evolving that. So it's well understood now. FedNow is launching. So as we look at that, we will obviously continue to compete and offer our services to our banking and issuing partners.At the same time, in our experience, to your question, we have stayed close to these systems in various other countries in the end, ending up partnering with most of them. So here, we'll have to see where it goes live. Going live doesn't mean that it is broadly available yet. It is early days, as you said. It doesn't have features. It doesn't have a consumer platform as such. You can't access it through your mobile banking app. All of that is what our solution today provides. So we have to see where it goes. Head-on competition by the mindset of partnership where and when it makes sense for us and where this goes.It is important to say that we do have solutions for these systems. If you look at the Chase Pay by Bank solution that we put into the market, so that's exactly leveraging these kind of flows that would run across these systems, generally B2B-focused. Some noncard penetration verticals run across these particular systems. So we see that as an opportunity. And Chase Pay by Bank app will be one of those ways to going after that. We've done similar kind of solutions in the U.K., in Europe and so forth. So more to come. We'll stay very close. At this point in time, I think we have a better solution in the market.OperatorWe'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniI had a question on the Fed routing rules on debit. I guess the card-not-present transactions went through in July. I'm just curious sort of how you see the opportunity there. It would seem like you're in a good position to take some share.Michael MiebachRight. So the clarification came to networks available as of 1st of July. So we put that in place and we said we would, and we're ready to do that. It's still early days. We have to see where that goes. But as you rightly said, Sanjay, we stand ready to compete. And that is certainly we will look for the opportunity, and I'm sure we will find it.OperatorNext, we'll go to Lisa Ellis at MoffettNathason.Lisa Ann Dejong EllisMichael, in the prepared remarks, you highlighted that with Mastercard's real-time ACH strategy, you're sort of in the phase of transitioning from building out infrastructure to focusing more on building applications and services. Just kind of taking a step back, it's always been a big differentiator for Mastercard that you own infrastructure in fast ACH with Vocalink and Nets' Corporate Services. Can you just kind of comment a bit on the movie over the last 6 or 7 years? Like how has that helped differentiate Mastercard in the -- in terms of being able to capture account-to-account network payments, new flows, et cetera?Michael MiebachThanks, Lisa. So real-time payments -- when the rise of real-time payments started 2016, '17 and so forth and we invested into Vocalink, it was clear at the time that we wanted to be in the infrastructure application services. That was a bit of the logic.At the time, we needed the street cred and we needed the talent so we can participate in this trend from day 1. That was the first season of the movie, so to say, to stick with your analogy.Where we are today, we've built out an enviable and unique position in real-time payments, having a footprint in 13 of the top 50 GDP countries where we run and partially operate real-time payment infrastructure. Our strategy was we will be in the markets that matter and we don't win to be in the markets that don't matter. So we feel we've reached that point. And now it's really to drive up scale and use that infrastructure position. The business in itself of running these systems in these markets is attractive enough. As we pointed out, we're going to focus on building out a set of applications and services on top of that.If you recall from the prepared remarks where I talked about the scam -- the anti-scam solution in the U.K. with these non-U.K. banks, it's a fantastic example of how our expertise in these markets has positioned us to rally 9 banks around the table to come up with a market-wide solution.Now not everything that we will do will be market-wide solutions. There will be individual customer solutions, but we feel we have muscle in this space. It's not going to go away. All these government payment systems out there, more and more real-time payment solutions will come up, and I think we will be in demand. And because we've done it for a long time, we'll have a seat at the table.OperatorWe'll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.Darrin David PellerCould we touch on value-added services for a moment? I mean it's been a good tailwind for some time. I think it grew just about 1 point below transactions this time around. And you mentioned strength in cyber and some other categories, offset by -- that were offsetting others. So I'd be curious to get a little more detail as to what were the strengths and weaknesses of value-added services now, including the other. And then more importantly, just how much room do you think you have across those different categories to keep that growth alive and cross-sell well into your meaningful payments business?Michael MiebachRight. So let me start, and then Sachin can add a bit around the various dynamics around growth rates and so forth. So as I said in prepared remarks, payments and services complement each other. The strategy is the combination of both and we extend that into new networks. So that's the starting point. We remain convinced that, that is a key reason that all those wins I just talked about earlier are happening, so central to our strategy.Our services in aggregate continue to grow faster than the core. So we continue to diversify our revenue base. We like that. We want to continue to do that. There's a whole range of services to choose from. We could do lots of things. We have pruned our strategy when it comes to processing because we didn't feel that was such a differentiator. But we felt that cybersecurity in a world that is rapidly digitizing is just going to drive the biggest demand, and we're seeing that coming through in the numbers when I look into our C&amp;I business, which grow at a very healthy clip.If you think about our D&amp;S and data analytics business, here, we keep on building out the value chain. It's a vertically integrated value chain we have -- where we have Test &amp; Learn, we have loyalty and you go all the way into personalization that is before, after, during the transaction, helping our customers run a better business.I don't see an end to the demand. In fact, that is key to our segment diversification strategy. So running at a healthy clip. I don't see any moderation here. This is -- will continue to grow. And you should see us continue to build out across the key aspects of services in cybersecurity and data analytics insight. So we love this business, and we'll continue to nourish it.Sachin MehraDarrin, it's Sachin. A couple of additional thoughts. So Michael kind of covered off the strength we continue to see in our value-added services and solutions. And that's indeed the case. But you got to remember that growth rates move around quarter-to-quarter on this area. And so we should all focus on the longer-term trends out here.As it relates specifically to Q2, when you look at growth rates for value-added services and solutions in Q2 of 16%, I assume you're looking at the sequential trend out there. One point to keep in mind is that there was a 1 ppt drop in Q2 on account of acquisitions. So Q1 had the impact of acquisitions. Q2 doesn't have it because it kind of lapped that acquisition period. So that's one piece.And then specifically in my comments, I talked about that the strength in Cyber &amp; Intelligence as well as in some of our Data &amp; Services capabilities was offset by other solutions. And it's really all about what the growth rate trends are for Cyber &amp; Intelligence and Data &amp; Services relative to growth rates and things like real-time ACH, especially on the infrastructure level. So when we talk about other solutions, think about it in the context of things like real-time ACH, which tend to grow at a lower pace there.So historically, what we had spoken about was just services. Now we are talking about value-added services and solutions. When we think about services in the historical context, in Q2, that services growth rate was more like 18%. So just for a reference point beyond that.OperatorWe'll move next to Timothy Chiodo at Credit Suisse.Timothy Edward ChiodoI want to dig in a little bit on another business that is important to your -- both your volume and your revenue growth algorithm over the medium term, which will be Mastercard Send. You touched a little bit on some of the cross-border use cases. I believe many of the initial use cases were much more domestic, but it's evolving over time. Maybe you could just dig in a little bit more to some of the cross-border use cases that are really gaining traction.Michael MiebachRight. So Timothy, let me start off with that. So our Send business domestic and cross-border together, that's how we look at it. There's a big chunk in there, which is cross-border disbursement remittances, as you rightly said. The way that we go after that is by adding new geographies. I gave you 3 markets that we've added this year, Chile Bahrain and Slovakia. So there is tremendous reach -- unparalleled reach in what we have in our cross-border proposition, 100 countries around the world.Then there's new ways to go after it, and that is the use cases. So earlier when I was talking about gaming payout, some of that is domestic, some of that is international. The whole workers' remittances piece, Al Fardan in Qatar, those are important corridors. We very specifically go after these corridors, Middle East into South Asia and so forth. So it's pretty methodological.But there's another way that -- which I haven't talked about on how to accelerate this business, and this is how we make it easier for customers to onboard with us. So cross-border service express, which is kind of prepackaged solution around cross-border payments is another way for us to accelerate this business. So new geographies, new use cases, corridor-specific, great methodology. I think we have the right kind of assets here across our HomeSend integration, across our Transfast acquisition, the Mastercard proprietary system and our card reach.So all in, this is growing at a very healthy pace, and we like that business a lot. We are experts in cross-border, as you know, on the card side, and we're building that out here -- over here in cross-remittances and disbursements.OperatorWe'll go to our next question from Rayna Kumar at UBS.Rayna KumarBoth of you in the past have discussed how B2B remains a large opportunity for Mastercard. Can you talk about what trends you're seeing in B2B payments in this macro environment, how you're progressing against capturing the TAM and if you're seeing any slowdown in corporate spending as companies potentially tighten their budgets?Michael MiebachThank you, Rayna. I'm noticing a lot of questions coming from me means that there isn't a lot of questions in the numbers, which is fantastic. And I love to talk about B2B. Let me take the lens, Rayna, that's a little bit broader here on commercial overall.So I feel like I'm repeating myself here, but we're choosing priorities because they are growing at a healthy clip, so is the story for commercial growing at a healthy clip. So this is -- we're seeing a quarter-over-quarter, year on -- quarter 2 year-over-year growth above the consumer side. There's particular strength in our international markets business. And we've sustained elevated levels of growth when we compare this back to 2019, all the noise of COVID out of it.We have 2 main focuses in this area. One is commercial point of sale, and the other one is our B2B accounts payable business. Commercial point of sale, now this is a tremendous total market opportunity, massive TAM out there, and it's likely penetrated by cards today. The way we look at this is, this isn't really about building new systems. This is about penetrating with the tools that we have today, targeting SMEs and corporate T&amp;E, purchasing fleet, all of that with our existing capabilities that we have plus our complementary solutions like smart data and easy savings and so forth.So a lot of cash and checks out there, a lot of opportunity with cards that we have today. So we leverage that. We built out a separate vertical in the company. We're focusing hard, and we're seeing the growth rewarding us for that.On the B2B side, this is accounts payable, trusted relationships, this is invoice payments and so forth. This is an even larger TAM with a lot of clear pain points. Companies are looking to automate these processes, digitize these processes, get rid of the paper. And virtual cards is a solution that works tremendously well. We -- as I called it earlier, we are the leaders in virtual cards.But the solution isn't perfect. So we invest a lot of energy through our product teams to make it better and better. What I was saying earlier on Receivables Manager, this is a way to automate the acceptance of virtual card payments, build it into the accounts receivable system, automate it to get the benefits of virtual cards without some of the manual processes that we have to go through over the past year.So this is a real breakthrough. This business is going to be hugely important for us going forward. We called it out in November 2021 at our Strategy Day. It's one of our biggest growth opportunities. We feel we're ahead in the market, and we're seeing the healthy growth. And that will be remaining a focus for us.OperatorWe'll go next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarGood quarter guys. Michael, since you said Sachin's not getting enough questions, maybe I'll ask a numbers question.Michael MiebachYes, please.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarSo I wanted to figure out sort of the cadence of operating expense. 3Q versus 4Q, it sort of looks like -- it looks like you're kind of exiting the year a little bit higher than the 3Q levels in terms of growth. So what's causing that as well as -- I know your cadence of spending tends to be longer term in nature, but are there product or service call-outs in terms of the types of investments that you're making that's most pertinent now?Sachin MehraSo look, what we shared with you is our thoughts around what we think operating expenses look like in the third quarter. And I've given you what the full year numbers -- or what our expectations for the full year numbers are. So I think you can kind of back into what our operating expense growth rate is going to be or is expected to be in the fourth quarter.There's nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint in Q4. Honestly, I would tell you, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis growth rates, when you back into those numbers, you'll see there's nothing really unusual going on there.Broadly speaking, on OpEx, here's what I would say. We continue to remain focused on driving our operating expenses in what matters. It's the strategic priorities. It's making sure we're channeling our capital in the appropriate manner to drive growth both in the short, medium and long term. And that's what we'll continue to do.As you know, we are a people business, to a large extent, because a lot of what we do from a tech development standpoint is around people. A lot of what we do from a sales standpoint is around people. So that's what we invest in. So when you see growth rates in terms of operating expenses, I tend to call out personnel as one of the line items essentially for that reason alone, which is the growth comes from people and people are the ones who actually bring the assets that are there for -- which allow us to deliver that revenue. But really nothing unusual going on from an OpEx standpoint as we exit the year.Michael MiebachYes. So we keep top and bottom line growth in mind. But there is a tremendous opportunity ahead of us right now. So we are using this tailwind that we're currently seeing to continue to invest. You see the list of wins, the growth momentum in B2B, the growth momentum in services. So this is the time to continue to nourish that business and invest, and you will see us do that in a very prudent and disciplined fashion.OperatorWe'll go next to Dan Dolev at Mizuho.Dan DolevJust a quick question on the guidance. Like obviously, results were very strong. You exceeded your second quarter guidance on revenue. Like what was the thought process of not boosting the guidance for the year?Sachin MehraSo Dan, a couple of thoughts here. One, again, remember, we shared guidance in terms of ranges, and that's what we've shared out here as well, right? And when you think about ranges, it -- that's what they are in essence.Point number two is some of the beat, which we had in Q2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was driven by what we call timing of deal activity. We still expect to be active in the markets. We still expect to vigorously compete in these markets. And so I kind of intentionally mentioned that as timing only because we do expect that as the year progresses, we will continue to be active in the market. So I think you should take that into consideration as well.And then my only other comment I'd make is, in Q1, we had modestly increased our thoughts relative to what we had shared right at the start of the year. So when you bring all of that together, right, that's kind of our thinking behind what we shared from a full year guidance standpoint.OperatorWe'll go next to Bob Napoli at William Blair.Robert Paul NapoliOn open banking, Mastercard has been pretty aggressive in investing in open banking. But I just like some additional thoughts on maybe on how that's progressing and then how open banking maybe fits into other strategies like embedded finance and Banking as a Service.Michael MiebachAll right. So open banking, as you know, we specifically called that out as 1 of 2 opportunities in new networks. The trend is here to stay. That's pretty clear. This whole notion of people got to use their data footprint to avail better financial services. There's a lot more regulation coming around that. PSD3 in Europe is coming out. So this train is -- has left the station. That's good. We're on it.The way we look at it is we have to move beyond connectivity. We had a good start. We are well connected here in the U.S. through our Finicity asset and in Europe through our Aiia assets. And we're very busy now building use cases on top of that, and this is where we think the future is going.Initial demand of Finicity was very clearly in lending-oriented use cases and asset verification use cases. That feels that is where the demand is today. To Sachin's earlier point, where do we invest, we invest where we see the demand in the near-term event. So that is where we're optimizing.But you're already starting to see as we're going beyond these lending use cases with our solutions like our Chase Pay by Bank solution here in the U.S. This is using a payment success indicator, which is using open banking data to tell a biller this is a good time when there is balance on an account, please now bill. That is what the payment success indicator does. That is powered by Mastercard's open banking technology.So near-term use case is clear. That's working. Connectivity, we're well positioned with our 2 assets, and we're very busy building out use cases. And obviously, we're excited to see Pay by Bank with Chase launch in the third quarter as we said to you.OperatorWe'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.David Mark TogutCross-border volume growth remains very strong, but on Slide 9, clearly, there's a deceleration from April growth through June, especially in cross-border travel. So my question is for the second half, what growth rate in cross-border volume is embedded in your guidance?And then if you could go a little bit under the hood, what do you see in cross-border travel volumes? Maybe a little more texture on what you're seeing by country in Europe. You gave kind of overall data and some thoughts on China.Sachin MehraSure, David. So a couple of thoughts first. Let's start at the highest level, which is the value prop of cross-border travel still remains incredibly strong. So we've got a strong value prop. We have a strong presence in the market.As you'll remember, as we were going through COVID, when everybody had stopped traveling, we used that as an opportunity to continue to bolster our position in cross-border. And that's paying dividends right now. The fact that we were building portfolios and winning portfolios at that point in time is helping us actually drive strong growth in cross-border, broadly speaking, but also in travel.Now specifically to your question around trends, I think you're looking at year-over-year growth rates when you are looking at what the cross-border travel trajectory is month-over-month, the declines you were talking about. I'd encourage you to look at the right-hand side of Slide 9, which talks about the numbers indexed to 2019. And there, you could see actually there's an accelerating trend in cross-border travel.So said differently, you can see that in Q1, our cross-border travel as a percentage of 2019 was 148%. In Q2, that was 154%. In the first 3 weeks of July, that's 157%. The reason that's important is because the year-over-year growth rates are getting impacted by tougher comps from last year. And I think that's important to actually keep in mind.In terms of regional color, I would say that regions are performing well. Look, I mean the beauty of what we've got at Mastercard is a diversified business model. It's diversified across multiple dimensions, across payments and services, across products, across channels of sale, across regions. And the fact that we've got this presence -- strong presence across various regions helps us in the cross-border side as well.And really, what we're seeing is good, sustained growth in cross-border, both on travel as well as nontravel, across the globe. We're seeing accelerating trends in Asia Pacific, which we had very much expected and spoken about. That's what you're seeing coming through in the nature of the numbers here.We still think there are pockets of opportunity on a going-forward basis, in particular going into China and coming out of China. Just as a reference point, Michael talked about how cross-border travel inbound into China stood at approximately 50% of 2019 levels in Q2. That just goes to show what the opportunity remaining there is. Conversely, cross-border travel outbound from China was approximately 70% in Q2. And so that -- both those numbers will give you an indication of where the opportunities lie on a going-forward basis. And as we continue to do what we're doing in terms of winning more portfolios, enriching our proposition, luring services such as our loyalty programs, that just helps us position us well on a going-forward basis. So that's the kind of color I'd like to share with you on this. Broadly speaking, I think we're in a very good place as it relates to cross-border.Michael MiebachMaybe one thing to add here that is the current imbalance in the market between demand and supply. So there's still an unlock there as in airline capacity, airport capacity and all of that will unlock. So the combination of the underlying desire to travel, how that trend is coming through our position -- strong position in the travel industry with our portfolios, Expedia and Lufthansa, just to add, too, here, and this unlock of capacity over time will be a very good mix. This is an exciting space. People just want to be out there.OperatorWe'll go next to Dan Perlin at RBC.Daniel Rock PerlinI just wanted to maybe dig a little deeper on the commentary around this moderation in inflation and spending, Sachin, that you called out. Particularly, what can you tell us about kind of the downdraft in average tickets during the current quarter?And then maybe more specifically, are you seeing any discernible signs or indications of trade-downs from the consumer that would be high corollaries to slightly weaker consumer spending as opposed to this resiliency that it sounds like you guys are continuing to talk about?Sachin MehraSure, Dan. So a couple of thoughts. I mean it's no surprise. I think you guys are all seeing that inflation, while still remaining at high levels, has started to moderate, right? So you're seeing that come through in terms of the nature of spend, right? We're a nominal value business. And at the end of the day, right, inflation -- declining inflation quarter-over-quarter will have an impact. So that was important to actually call out.And then I also talked about how there's a moderation in select markets -- international markets. The reality is when you look at markets -- and this is not broad-based, right? There are select markets where -- let's take a market like the U.K. At the end of the day, rising interest rates and high inflation levels, ultimately, will put a squeeze on people's ability to spend. That doesn't mean that the consumer isn't necessarily resilient. The consumer remains resilient on a more holistic basis.But at the margin, right, what you start to see is as, say, for example, mortgages get reset, when mortgages get reset, they're getting reset at high interest rates. What it's doing is it's squeezing the wallet -- or share of wallet, which would be available for other discretionary categories of spend. So you're going to see a little bit of that trend come through, which is what we were kind of calling out.But all of that is factored into our thinking as we think about the rest of the year and in my full year guidance. So that's really, in essence, what we were kind of thinking about.So again, I'll summarize it by saying there's recent reductions in inflation. There's a little bit of moderation in select international markets. And really, we haven't seen this as being broad-based. We haven't seen this as something which is causing concerns for us. It's very much in line with what we've been thinking about from a guidance standpoint. And I'll remind you that at the end of the day, cross-border continues to be strong, back to the question which David just asked. So to kind of bring that all together, right, we feel good about what the strength of the consumer is.Devin CorrI think we have time for one more question.OperatorAnd we'll take that question from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.Bryan Connell KeaneSachin, just want to ask about FX volatility and how it impacts the model. I know cross-border assessment revenue growth was above volume, so it had a positive yield. I think in your peers -- one of your peers' reports, it was actually negative, and they called out the lack of FX volatility. So just trying to understand how it impacts Mastercard's model.Sachin MehraSure, Bryan. So first, the -- what -- when we talk about FX volatility, you see that in our numbers in transaction processing assessments, not in cross-border assessments. It is tied to the activity about clear and settle, which is why it sits in transaction processing assessments.And what I called out was the higher growth rate in cross-border assessments relative to volume was driven by what we call favorable mix, which is the fact that our inter volumes, which is everything ex intra-Europe, right, are growing at a faster pace than intra-Europe. Inter volumes tend to be high yielding than -- as compared to intra. And that's the reason you had that positive kind of gap between where revenues were on cross-border assessments and where volumes were. And again, the volatility comment I made was tied to transaction processing assessments, which is where it sits.Devin CorrThank you. Michael, any closing comments?Michael MiebachAll right. Thanks, Devin. The first thing I want to say, you should all know that Warren sits in the other room and is listening to us. So this is the first time soloed by Devin, and we're delighted to -- with this next chapter now.As always, I want to make a comment about all the people at Mastercard who make this happen, the 30,000 of us. I sent them a note earlier today with the results that, this is the value that you guys deliver every day. So I just wanted to share that with you.And with that, thank you for your support, your questions today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.Sachin MehraThanks, everyone.OperatorAnd this concludes today's conference call. Again, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

(NYSE: PHM), one of the nation's largest home construction firms, highlighted alleged racial discrimination, unfair dismissal, and systemic racism within the corporation.Ryan Adams, a former PulteGroup employee, initiated the suit. Adams, who worked for the company for three years, experienced a controversial dismissal.See also: Share Sales, Harassment Allegations And Power Play: Turbulence Hits PulteGroupWhat Happened: Adams, a Black employee, claims his dismissal was unjust, stemming from an incident involving an allegedly unauthorized package—despite package handling being a core component of his job.He maintains that there were no verbal or written warnings given prior to his dismissal, a decision he attributes directly to racial discrimination, a behavior he alleges is common among PulteGroup's senior executives and managers.According to the lawsuit, PulteGroup's treatment of Adams resulted in a hostile work environment.Adams alleges that he endured degrading, demeaning, humiliating, and offensive treatment based on his race, which led to emotional distress and anxiety.The lawsuit also contends that PulteGroup's senior executives favored the promotion of white employees loyal to them over minority employees who had merit, thus sidestepping corporate policies and scrutiny.The lawsuit specifically names CEO Ryan Marshall, accusing him of fostering systemic racism within the company. It alleges that the 2020 establishment of a ""Diversity Board"" was a sham, as the board failed to address discrimination complaints from Black employees.Another incident under scrutiny involves former Vice President of Construction Operations, Patrick Witzigman, who allegedly brought a lynching noose to a meeting with Black employees.Adams's lawsuit focuses on a violation of the Michigan Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (ELCRA), which outlaws employment discrimination based on race.Story continuesAccording to the lawsuit, Adams contends that PulteGroup, his employer, had a responsibility to not discriminate against him concerning employment, promotion opportunities, compensation, or other conditions or privileges of employment based on his race.Adams further alleges that PulteGroup violated ELCRA by retaliating when he filed a complaint about the discriminatory practices to which he was subjected.Adams is seeking more than $25,000 in compensation for each count, plus interest, costs, attorney fees, and punitive, compensatory, and exemplary damages for injuries and damages he suffered.Check out:REIT Downgrades Increase: Are Analysts Trying To Warn Investors?Here's Zillow Founder's Only Real Estate Investment — He Finds The Sector 'Unapproachable And Complex'Image from ShutterstockDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Adjusted EPS, including discontinued operations, is expected in the range of $2.92-$3.00, while the same from continuing operations is expected in the band of $2.49-$2.57.Summing UpBaxter ended second-quarter 2022 with improvement in both earnings and revenues. Sales across all product categories were strong except for decline in Patient Support Systems, led by lower rental revenues. Robust growth rates across all geographies buoy optimism. However, declining gross and operating margins are concerning.The company expects the demand for its medically essential products to continue amid a stabilizing macroeconomic climate and healthcare marketplace. It stated that the ongoing transformational actions, announced earlier this year, will likely boost its performance going forward.The transformational actions, which include realigning its businesses and operations into four vertically integrated global business segments, are likely to be completed by July 2024. Baxter is also progressing with the proposed spin-off of Kidney Care segment — comprising Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories — into an independent, publicly traded company. This is also a part of BAX’s transformational actions.Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseBaxter International Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

Sales declined 4.9% year over year on a reported basis and 4.2% on an operational basis. The downside was caused by lower sales of Humira, Imbruvica and Eye care products, which was partially offset by the rise in product sales of key drugs like Rinvoq, Skyrizi, Botox and Vraylar.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-on-year basis and at constant exchange rates (CER).Quarter in DetailIn immunology, AbbVie’s flagship drug Humira recorded a year-over-year sales decline of 24.8% to $4.01 billion on an operational basis. Sales in the United States declined 26.0% to $3.45 billion, while ex-U.S. market sales were down 17.0% on an operational basis to $560 million. The drug’s sales beatthe Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates that were pegged at $3.93 billion and $3.95 billion, respectively.This substantial decline in Humira sales was due to the drug’s recent loss of exclusivity in the United States. Earlier this January, Amgen AMGN announced the launch of the first Humira biosimilar in the United States, called Amjevita.Like Amgen, several other companies like Boehringer Ingelheim, Coherus BioSciences and Novartis NVS have also started marketing their own Humira biosimilars since the onset of this month. Novartis, through its generic division Sandoz, markets its Humira biosimilar under the trade name Hyrimoz. Like Amgen and Novartis, more generic drugmakers are planning to launch their own Humira biosimilars throughout this year. These subsequent launches are expected to erode Humira’s sales in subsequent quarters. The drug lost the exclusivity in ex-U.S. territories following the launch of generics in 2018.Story continuesNet revenues from Rinvoq in the second quarter were $918 million, up 56.7% on an operational basis year over year. The upside can be attributed to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in recent quarters. Rinvoq sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $896 million and $878 million, respectively.Net revenues recorded from Skyrizi in the second quarter were $1.88 billion, up 51.0% on an operational basis year over year. This uptick in sales is due to label expansions to the drug to include new patient populations in the recent quarters. Skyrizi sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.77 billion and $1.76 billion, respectively.Sales from the neuroscience portfolio increased 14.2% on an operational basis to $1.89 billion, driven by higher sales of Botox Therapeutic and Vraylar. The new migraine drug Qulipta also contributed to sales growth. Neuroscience sales figures beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.82 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively.While Botox Therapeutic sales rose 11.3% to $748 million, sales of Vraylar increased 33.9% to $658 million. Sales of AbbVie’s oral migraine drug Ubrelvy were $196 million, up 6.0% year over year.The recently-launched Qulipta generated $96 million in product revenues compared with $66 million in first-quarter 2023.AbbVie’s oncology/hematology (including Imbruvica and Venclexta) sales declined 9.8% on an operational basis to $1.48 billion in the quarter, as growth of Venclexta sales, was more than offset by lower sales of Imbruvica. The oncology/hematology sales figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $1.43 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively.Second-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $907 million, down 20.8% year over year. AbbVie markets the drug in partnership with Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The company shares international profits earned from Imbruvica with J&amp;J.U.S. sales of J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica grossed $666 million, down 22.8% from the year-ago figure. Sales of the J&amp;J-partnered Imbruvica declined amid rising competition from novel oral treatments in the United States. AbbVie’s share of profit from the international sales of the J&amp;J-partnered drug declined 14.7% to $241 million.AbbVie’s leukemia drug Venclexta generated revenues of $571 million in the reported quarter, reflecting 15.0% year-over-year growth.AbbVie’s aesthetics portfolio sales were up 2.9% on an operational basis to $1.38 billion, driven by rising Juvederm product sales. Sales of Juvederm rose 9.7% on an operational basis to $368 million, while Botox Cosmetic sales increased 0.7% on an operational basis to $685 million.Eye care portfolio sales declined 12.3% on an operational basis to $617 million. Sales of Ozurdex, a key drug in the portfolio, rose 10.2% year over year to $119 million.Cost DiscussionAdjusted SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.0% to $3.22 billion, while adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $1.73 billion in the second quarter, up 7.7% year over year. The adjusted operating margin contributed 47.0% to sales.Raises 2023 GuidanceAbbVie raised its earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance for 2023. The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $10.90-$11.10, up from the previously-provided EPS guidance of $10.57-$10.97.Our TakeAbbVie’s second-quarter results were better than expected, with the top and the bottom line beating the consensus mark. The company also raised its EPS guidance for 2023. Shares rose 2.1% in pre-market trading on Jul 27 attributable to this guidance raise.Year to date, AbbVie’s shares have lost 12.2% against the industry’s 1.8% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the presence of Amgen’s Amjevita in first-half 2023, Humira sales beat both our model and consensus estimates. This reflected on a slower conversion to the Amgen biosimilar. However, we expect this conversion to accelerate as more Humira biosimilars are launched. This month alone, at least five Humira biosimilars were launched by Boehringer Ingelheim, Samsung Bioepis, Biocon, Coherus BioSciences and Novartis. The number of biosimilars is only expected to rise going forward.AbbVie’s newer immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which have been launched across Humira's major indications and a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis, have to some extent succeeded in making up for lost Humira sales. The company’s neuroscience products have also been showing robust performance, being driven by sales of the recently approved migraine drugs, Qulipta and Ubrelvy.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc.

188,c6e52f34-026c-3f0d-b9b8-73f2c6685934,JNJ,2023-07-28,Fed's July Rate Hike and Comments Match Expectations: 5 Picks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-july-rate-hike-comments-122900134.html,1690460940,STORY,"['META', 'ISRG', 'GOOGL', 'JNJ']","[On Jul 26, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25-5.5%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings before giving a pause in the June 2023 meeting. It again reinitiated the rate hiking regime as the inflation rate remained elevated, at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate.In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said ""The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."" Powell also accepted the fact that the aggregate price level has moderated steadily since June 2022.According to Powell, “I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting. The FOMC will be assessing the totality of the incoming data” and its implications for economic activity and inflation.Importantly, a 25-basis point rise in interest rate was fully priced in market valuations. Moreover, the Fed Chairman did not surprise either in positive or negative direction with his comment. Consequently, Wall Street did not react overwhelmingly. The Dow rose 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1% and the S&amp;P 500 remained almost flat.Stock Selection ProcessAt his stage, we have adopted three stock selection criteria that will strengthen investor’s portfolio. First, select those stocks that have released impressive second-quarter 2023 earnings results with solid guidance. Second, select stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and earnings beat will drive stock prices in the near future. Third, select corporate giants (market capital &gt; 100 billion) as these companies enjoy a robust business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and strong financial position.Story continuesOur Top Picks Based on the above-mentioned criteria, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths.

189,81e99d77-ddb6-3716-8f9c-550e74770a76,JNJ,2023-07-28,3 Top Blue Chip Stocks to Ride the Dow Rally,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-blue-chip-stocks-122500594.html,1690460700,STORY,"['JNJ', 'WMT', 'BA', 'MMM', 'JPM']","[The Dow is experiencing a fantastic July, with the blue-chip index extending a winning streak not seen in decades, thanks to upbeat corporate earnings and the possibility of a pause in rate hikes soon.It, thus, makes sense to place bets on solid blue-chip players like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Walmart Inc. WMT and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ that can make the most of a Dow rally.Dow Seals Longest Winning Streak in 36 YearsAfter a volatile trading session on Jul 26, the Dow was able to clinch its longest winning streak since Jan 20, 1987, per Dow Jones Market Data. The 30-stock blue-chip index scaled upward by 82.05 points, or 0.23%, to register its 13th consecutive trading session in the green.The Dow’s latest milestone is now registered in the history books, and if the blue-chip gauge extends its winning streak for another trading session, it will notch its longest daily winning streak since June 1897, which was one year after the index was created in May 1896.Corporate Profits Are ImprovingThe Dow was able to hold onto its positive momentum as the latest corporate quarterly earnings results were mostly encouraging for the blue-chip stocks.3M Company’s MMM shares moved northward after the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat. Similarly, The Coca-Cola Company’s KO shares moved up on promising earnings results for the quarter that ended in June and a positive outlook for the rest of 2023.The Boeing Company’s BA shares also soared after the company’s free cash flow in the second quarter improved following an uptick in commercial aircraft deliveries.Fed Raises Rates But Could Pause AgainMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased its interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as prices of indispensable commodities remain above the central bank’s target of 2%.The Fed has hiked interest rates in 11 of its last 12 meetings, and now the benchmark overnight interest rates are 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in more than 22 years.Story continuesHowever, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did indicate that interest rate hikes may be paused shortly, as was done in the June meeting. The Fed remains data-driven, and the central bank may choose to hold rates steady in the September meeting.Market pundits are also betting on a rate hike pause in September. Almost 77.2% of them are expecting the Fed to pause rate hikes in the next meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Thus, chances of pausing rate hikes boosted investors’ sentiment and helped the Dow scale upward as well. After all, rate hikes impact consumer outlays, increase borrowing costs and hamper economic activities.3 Best Blue Chip Stocks for a Winning PortfolioBanking on such hopefulness, there will be a sharp run-up in the index of 30 stocks. The companies on the index are slated to advance further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, solid balance sheets, and steady cash flow.We have, thus, selected three such blue-chip stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.JPMorgan is one of the biggest global banks. Now, a possible rate hike pause may not bode well for the bank, but its strong liquidity position and recent strategic acquisitions should certainly help it chug along in the near term.JPMorgan has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JPM’s current-year earnings has moved up 7.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 25.8%. JPM’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5%.Walmart is now an omnichannel player and not just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer. The company’s impressive comp sales are driving growth, while its e-commerce business is expanding.Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMT’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.3% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 10.5%. WMT’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5.5%.Johnson &amp; Johnson operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products divisions. While its MedTech division is enjoying strong fundamentals, the company remains engaged in expanding the labels of some of its marketed products.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.7% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5.7%.

At a prespecified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), the KEYTRUDA-based regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pCR rate compared to neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy. A pCR is defined as a lack of all signs of cancer in tissue samples analyzed following completion of neoadjuvant therapy and definitive surgery.Based on the recommendation of the DMC, the trial will continue without changes to evaluate the other dual primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS), per the trial design. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.""This is the first positive Phase 3 study evaluating an immunotherapy-based regimen for patients with high-risk, early-stage ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and an important milestone in our efforts to advance research in early-stage breast cancer,"" said Dr. Gursel Aktan, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to sharing the detailed results with the medical community and thank the patients and investigators for their important contributions to this study.""Story continues""While significant advancements have been made in the treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, people diagnosed with high-risk disease as assessed by clinical and pathologic criteria typically have a worse prognosis and limited options before surgery,"" said Dr. Fatima Cardoso, director of the Breast Unit of the Champalimaud Clinical Centre, Lisbon, Portugal and co-principal investigator. ""Data from KEYNOTE-756 suggest that adding pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery can significantly improve the pCR rate compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone for people with high-risk, early-stage ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.""""Worldwide, more than two million people are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and it is critically important that breast cancer is found and treated early, especially for patients with high-risk disease,"" said Dr. Aditya Bardia, attending physician, medical oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, director, breast cancer research, Massachusetts General Cancer Center, Associate professor, Harvard Medical School and co-principal investigator. ""While we wait for event-free survival data, these initial pCR results provide a potentially encouraging signal and may have important therapeutic implications for patients with high-risk, early-stage ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.""In the U.S., KEYTRUDA is approved for two indications for the treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Based on results from KEYNOTE-522, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery for patients with high-risk, early-stage TNBC. Based on results from KEYNOTE-355, KEYTRUDA is approved in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (combined positive score [CPS ≥10]) as determined by an FDA-approved test. In addition to the U.S., KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE-355 supported the approvals of KEYTRUDA-based regimens for certain patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC and locally recurrent unresectable metastatic TNBC, respectively, in more than 90 countries around the world.About KEYNOTE-756KEYNOTE-756 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03725059) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus endocrine therapy for the treatment of high-risk, early-stage ER+/HER2- breast cancer. The dual primary endpoints are pCR rate and EFS, and secondary endpoints include overall survival and safety. The trial enrolled 1,240 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks [Q3W]) plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel weekly) for four cycles, followed by four additional cycles of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by nine cycles of KEYTRUDA (Q3W) plus endocrine therapy (for up to 10 years) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery; or,Placebo (Q3W) plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel weekly) for four cycles, followed by four additional cycles of placebo in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by nine cycles of placebo (Q3W) plus endocrine therapy (for up to 10 years) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery.About breast cancerBreast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide, with more than two million patients diagnosed and approximately 685,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 298,000 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,700 deaths from the disease in 2023. The are many different types of breast cancer and various subtypes. Of all breast cancer patients, about 70% will be diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease. Cancer recurrence following surgery for this type of cancer is most common within five years, and patients with high-risk features have a greater chance of recurrence.About Merck’s research in breast and gynecologic cancersMerck has a comprehensive clinical development program in breast and gynecological (ovarian, cervical, and endometrial) cancers, comprised of more than 20 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Triple-Negative Breast CancerKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery.KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥10) as determined by an FDA-approved test.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients.

Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk.

It aims to create $25 billion in annual savings by 2031 for a country that pays more for prescription medicines than any other.Medicare, which serves Americans age 65 and older, is working on selecting 10 drugs for the first wave of negotiation on prices that would go into effect in 2026. They will be selected from medicines that have been on the market at least nine years - 13 years for more complex biotech drugs - without what the agency sees as ample direct competition.Each year, Medicare will add more drugs to the list, the names of which have not yet been disclosed. In 2028, it will start negotiating on drugs that are typically given in a hospital setting like these.Story continuesThe U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, which runs the Medicare program for more than 60 million Americans, declined to comment on whether it will consider older medicines that add hyaluronidase as new.Evercore ISI biotech analyst Michael DiFiore said he expects Medicare to do so because hyaluronidase is an active ingredient that allows the body to absorb more of the drug when it is injected.""That is unique specialized technology,"" DiFiore said.When Medicare issued guidelines for negotiations earlier this year, it closed many loopholes that could have allowed drugmakers to game the system by making small changes to their drugs. Going from an immediate release to an extended release formulation would be one example of this, he said.Injectable cancer treatments that include hyaluronidase are not that in that category, DiFiore said.BILLIONS AT STAKEJ&amp;J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk, in an interview last week, said he does not expect the subcutaneous version of Darzalex, called Darzalex Faspro, to be eligible for negotiation until 2033 or 2034.That could be five or more years beyond Darzalex, which will have been on the market for 13 years in 2028. Faspro, launched in 2020, already accounts for more than 80% of Darzalex revenue, which is due to rise to $9.5 billion this year.Merck has said it hopes to launch its Keytruda injectable within a few years, with approval starting the 13-year clock until negotiation eligibility. The infused version of Keytruda could be subject to the program as soon as 2028.Merck previously told Reuters it expects this version of Keytruda could replace the more time consuming infusion for most patients. Keytruda revenue is expected to top $24 billion this year and could exceed $30 billion as soon as 2026, according to analyst estimates.San Diego-based Halozyme had $660 million in 2022 revenue. The company has said its expects revenue from subcutaneous drugs containing hyaluronidase to drive its growth going forward.CEO Helen Torley said in Halozyme's opinion, Medicare has made its view on what defines separate drugs “very, very clear,” and that these injectables made with hyaluronidase will be treated as a new drug.(Reporting by Michael Erman; Additional reporting by Patrick Wingrove; Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

For a quick overview of the top five countries, read our article 5 Countries With Highest Rates of Cancer.Cancer, a pervasive and devastating disease, leaves a profound global impact. Also known as malignant tumors or neoplasms, cancer encompasses a wide array of illnesses that can emerge in various parts of the body. One of its defining features is the rapid growth of abnormal cells that surpass their normal limits, infiltrating nearby tissues and possibly metastasizing to other organs. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, accounting for almost one in six deaths globally. In addition, the World Cancer Research Fund estimates that 18,094,716 million cases of cancer were diagnosed that same year. When considering all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and combining data for both men and women, the age-standardized rate was 190 cases per 100,000 individuals. Notably, this rate was higher among men, with 206.9 cases per 100,000, compared to women, who had a rate of 178.1 cases per 100,000 individuals. In the global context, Europeans are disproportionately affected by cancer. While Europeans make up only one-tenth of the world population, about 25% of all annual cancer cases occur in Europe.The field of oncology represents a vast and swiftly expanding domain within biopharmaceutical research and development (R&amp;D). According to Precedence Research, the global oncology market surpassed an impressive value of $203 billion in 2022, and it is estimated to continue growing with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8% until 2032, reaching a significant value of $470.61 billion. Notably, within this growth trajectory, the hospital segment is projected to experience even more rapid expansion, with a forecasted CAGR of 10.9% during the specified period.Story continuesSee also: 25 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the WorldOn the other hand, the field of cancer vaccines has also gained significant global attention. Cancer treatment vaccines differ from the vaccines designed to combat viruses. The primary goal of cancer treatment vaccines is to stimulate the immune system to target and attack cancer cells present within the body. Unlike preventive vaccines that aim to stop diseases from occurring, cancer treatment vaccines are intended to trigger an immune response against an existing disease, encouraging the immune system to combat and potentially eradicate cancerous cells. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) have joined forces to develop a promising vaccine, combining an mRNA cancer vaccine with Moderna's Keytruda®. On July 26, the companies announced that the enrollment of patients had commenced for a late-stage clinical trial. Promising results from a mid-stage study involving 157 patients revealed that the combination of the vaccine and Keytruda significantly reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 44% in individuals with melanoma, the most fatal type of skin cancer, compared to the use of Keytruda alone. The progress in these areas showcases the increasing promise and dedication to enhancing cancer treatment using innovative vaccine strategies. If you're interested in learning more information about companies engaged in oncology and vaccine development, our list of the 11 Most Promising Cancer Stocks According to Analysts provides valuable insights.20 Countries With Highest Rates of CancerOur MethodologyFor our list of the countries with the highest rates of cancer, we used the 2020 data from the World Cancer Research Fund which recorded the number of cancer cases across the globe. The countries on this list are ranked according to the cancer incidence rates per 100,000 individuals for that year.20. GermanyCancer Incidence Rate: 281.9In 2019, approximately 231,000 individuals succumbed to cancer in Germany, with 125,000 being men and 106,000 being women. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) highlights that a quarter of all deaths in the country during that period were attributed to cancer. Remarkably, this proportion remained nearly constant over a span of 20 years, despite a 10% increase in the number of cancer-related deaths compared to the figures recorded in 1999.19. JapanCancer Incidence Rate: 282.9Cancer is the most common cause of death for Japanese people who are 40 and over. According to a Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare report, in the year 2020, Japan saw a total of 378,356 cancer-related deaths, constituting 27.6% of all deaths that year, which means one out of every four deaths was due to cancer. The cancer death rate, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals, showed a steady increase, reaching 307.0 in 2020. For men, the highest death rate from cancer was attributed to lung cancer, causing 53,244 deaths, while the most prevalent cause of cancer-related death among women, with 24,069 deaths, was colorectal cancer.18. CroatiaCancer Incidence Rate: 284.1Despite spending more than the EU average on cancer treatment, Croatia's cancer mortality rate remains significantly elevated. While it ranks among the countries with the highest cancer rates, the country also has the second-highest cancer mortality rate among European Union (EU) countries, after Hungary, exceeding the EU average by 25%. According to WCRF statistics, Croatia recorded 25,001 cancer cases in 2020.17. CanadaCancer Incidence Rate: 287.4Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and 43% of all people in the country are expected to receive a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime. A recent study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) reveals that although overall cancer rates in Canada are on a decline, the number of cases and deaths is showing a slight increase due to factors like population growth and an aging population. The study, conducted collaboratively by the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada, and the Public Health Agency of Canada, projects an estimated 233,900 new cancer cases and 85,100 cancer-related deaths in Canada for the year 2022. This marks an increase from the estimated figures of 229,200 cancer cases and 84,600 cancer deaths in the year 2021.16. LithuaniaCancer Incidence Rate: 287.5Cancer stands as the second leading cause of death in Lithuania. Among all cancer-related deaths, lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers are the most commonly reported causes. Based on the estimates by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, Lithuania was projected to experience approximately 16,600 new cancer cases and over 8,000 cancer-related deaths in 2020. The overall cancer mortality rate in Lithuania was expected to surpass the EU average.15. SlovakiaCancer Incidence Rate: 290.4Cancer mortality remains alarmingly high in Slovakia. Lung and colorectal cancer stand out as the most prevalent causes of cancer-related deaths among the Slovak population, despite witnessing slight reductions in mortality rates since the year 2000. Nearly 30 000 new cases of cancer were recorded in Slovakia in 2020. Although the country implemented a national cancer plan in 2018, whose primary objectives were to lower the incidence of cancer cases, reduce cancer-related mortality rates, and enhance the overall quality of life for patients affected by oncological diseases, nearly 13,700 individuals succumbed to cancer in Slovakia, placing the country second in the EU in terms of cancer mortality in 2019.14. SerbiaCancer Incidence Rate: 291.6Ranking high among the countries with the highest rates of cancer, central Serbia reported nearly 30,000 new cancer cases, excluding the autonomous regions of Kosovo and Vojvodina, which was a significant increase from 19,000 cases recorded in 1999. Despite advancements in treatment options, the death toll in 2018 reached 15,500, as opposed to 12,000 in 1999. According to the 2020 statistics, Serbia recorded almost 50,000 instances of cancer, out of a population of nearly 7 million.13. New ZealandCancer Incidence Rate: 295.3In New Zealand (Aotearoa), approximately 25,000 people receive a cancer diagnosis each year, with almost 3,000 of those individuals being Māori. The most commonly diagnosed cancers include breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. However, cancer incidence patterns have shown changes over time, with some types, such as stomach and lung cancers, decreasing, while others, like liver and pancreatic cancers, are on the rise. Lung cancer and colorectal cancer contribute to the highest number of cancer-related deaths each year, accounting for around 1,700 and 1,200 fatalities, respectively. However, the country has seen substantial improvements in cancer survival rates over the past two decades, resulting in more people overcoming the disease.12. LatviaCancer Incidence Rate: 296.1Latvia faces considerable cancer incidence rates, as indicated by data from the European Cancer Information System (ECIS) of the Joint Research Centre. Based on pre-pandemic incidence trends, it was estimated that nearly 12,400 new cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2020. The age-standardized rate of new cancer cases per 100,000 population that year was was 606, which is approximately 7% higher than the EU average of 569 per 100,000 population. Prostate cancer was expected to have the highest number of new cases, with 219 per 100,000 population, followed by breast cancer (109 per 100,000 population), colorectal cancer (87 per 100,000 population), and lung cancer (60 per 100,000 population).11. United KingdomCancer Incidence Rate: 296.1Cancer remains a significant health issue in the UK, with a substantial number of new cases being diagnosed each year. According to a recent analysis conducted by Cancer Research UK, it is projected that over 500,000 people in the United Kingdom will receive cancer diagnoses annually by the year 2040. This represents a one-third increase from the current average 384,000 cases diagnosed each year, reaching a total of 506,000 new cases annually, surpassing half a million for the first time. While there are positive aspects, such as anticipated reductions in mortality rates for several cancer types, the absolute number of deaths is expected to rise by nearly a quarter to reach 208,000. The report predicts a total of approximately 8.4 million new cancer cases and an estimated 3.5 million cancer-related deaths between 2023 and 2040.10. United StatesCancer Incidence Rate: 297.3One of the countries suffering from high cancer rates, it is projected that around 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023.  Furthermore, the American Cancer Society predicts that approximately 609,820 individuals in the United States will lose their lives to cancer in 2023, equivalent to approximately 1670 deaths per day. In terms of gender-specific statistics, the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in men are expected to be lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. On the other hand, for women, the most significant causes of death are projected to be lung, breast, and colorectal cancers.9. SloveniaCancer Incidence Rate: 300.2In the 1960s, Slovenia took a significant step by establishing its national cancer registry, which proved instrumental in monitoring cancer incidence across the country. However, during the 1990s, a concerning rise in cervical cancer rates drew attention from experts and prompted the implementation of ZORA, Slovenia's national cervical cancer screening program. According to the WCRF, more than 13,000 cancer incidences were reported in 2020.8. NorwayCancer Incidence Rate: 312.3In Norway, one out of every three individuals below the age of 75 has received at least one cancer diagnosis. Across the entire population, the number of people with cancer in their medical history has now reached almost 300,000. Between 2017 and 2021, the age group with the highest cancer incidence in Norway was 70 to 74 years. Within this age group, the cancer incidence rate was higher in men compared to women. Specifically, the incidence rate for men was 19.1%, while for women, it was 14.3%.7. AustraliaCancer Incidence Rate: 312.3Cancer continues to be a significant contributor to illness and mortality in Australia. The estimated figures for 2021 indicate that approximately 151,000 Australians will receive a cancer diagnosis (equivalent to 413 cases per day), while 49,000 individuals are expected to lose their lives to cancer (equivalent to 135 deaths per day). In terms of cancer diagnosis, breast cancer is the most prevalent, closely followed by prostate cancer. However, when considering cancer-related mortality in 2021, lung cancer was projected to cause more deaths than any other cancer type, with colorectal cancer ranking second in terms of fatalities.6. The NetherlandsCancer Incidence Rate: 315.1According to data collected by the OECD on behalf of the European Commission, the annual death rate for cancer patients in the Netherlands is higher than the European average, with the country also recording one of the highest rates of cancer in Europe. The findings also revealed that Dutch men had a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer compared to Dutch women, with 759 new cases per 100,000 people for men and 577 for women. Similarly to trends across Europe, the most common cancers in the Netherlands include prostate, breast, colorectal (colon), and lung cancers, with the latter three also being the primary causes of death among cancer patients.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries With Highest Rates of Cancer.Suggested Articles:15 Deadliest Cancers in the U.S.20 Cities with the Highest Opioid Deaths in the U.S.20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The US.Disclosure: None. 20 Countries With Highest Rates of Cancer is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It delivered a negative earnings surprise of roughly 10.9% in the last reported quarter. The company’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect favorable demand for phosphate and potash. However, weaker fertilizer prices are expected to have affected its performance. Shares of Mosaic have lost 20.4% in the past year compared with a 22.2% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Indicate?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mosaic’s second-quarter consolidated sales is currently pegged at $3,216 million, calling for a decline of 40.1% from the year-ago quarter’s tally.Factors at PlayMosaic is expected to have benefited from favorable demand for phosphate and potash in the second quarter. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather. Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics.Strong demand is expected to have supported the company’s potash sales volumes in the quarter to be reported. The company, last month, said that it witnessed solid spring demand in North America in the second quarter. It sees total sales volumes of the Potash unit to be near the high end of its prior stated guidance of 2.0-2.2 million tons for the quarter. Our estimate for potash sales volumes for the second quarter is pegged at 2.183 million tons, reflecting a sequential increase of 14.3%.While demand is expected to have remained healthy in the second quarter, the postponement inventory restocking by customers in North America to the third quarter is likely to have impacted phosphate volumes in the to-be-reported quarter. The company anticipates the Phosphates unit’s sales volumes for the second quarter to be toward the low end of its previous guidance of 1.8-2.0 million tons. Our estimate for phosphate sales volumes for the second quarter stands at 1.823 million tons, indicating a sequential decline of 0.7%.Moreover, prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Weaker fertilizer prices are expected to have weighed on the company’s profitability in the June quarter.Our estimate for average selling price per ton for the Potash segment is pegged at $327, reflecting a sequential decline of 31.2%. We also expect average selling price per ton for the Phosphate unit to be $600, indicating a 16.3% sequential decline.Story continues The Mosaic Company Price and EPS Surprise The Mosaic Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Mosaic Company price-eps-surprise | The Mosaic Company Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mosaic this season.

200,0f42d91b-09f2-3c10-b029-4c32326a93ce,WMB,2023-07-28,Can Williams (WMB) Maintain Its Earnings Beat Streak in Q2?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/williams-wmb-maintain-earnings-beat-120100623.html,1690459260,STORY,"['WMB', 'PBA', 'MUSA']","[The Williams Companies, Inc. WMB is set to release second-quarter results on Aug 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 39 cents per share on revenues of $2.8 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oil and gas pipeline operator’s performance in the June quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Williams’ previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q1 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the energy infrastructure provider beat the consensus mark on a higher-than-expected contribution from the Northeast G&amp;P unit. Williams had reported adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. Revenues of $3.1 billion generated by the firm also came 8.3% above the consensus mark.WMB beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 12.9%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS SurpriseWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS SurpriseWilliams Companies, Inc. (The) price-eps-surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 2.5% fall year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests an 11.3% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderWilliams’ West unit — comprising interstate natural gas pipeline and other gathering and processing assets in the Western region of the United States — is expected to have done well in the to-be-reported quarter. Echoing the segment’s healthy dynamics and benefits associated with the acquisition of Trace Midstream’s Haynesville gathering and processing assets, our estimate for the quarter’s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $303.3 million. The number suggests a 2.5% increase from a profit of $296 million reported in the year-ago quarter.On a further positive note, the decrease in Williams’ costs might have buoyed its to-be-reported bottom line. In particular, our estimate for product cost is pegged at $786.2 million, indicating an 8.3% drop from $857 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Our model also predicts the company’s total expenses to fall 3.9% year over year to $1.9 billion. This downward trajectory could be attributed to WMB’s successful cost-control initiatives.However, as a counter to these factors, lower earnings from two key segments are likely to have hurt Williams’ results due to tepid commodity prices and seasonal effects. Going by our model, WMB’s Transmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico segment — which includes the company’s crown jewel and the nation’s largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline system, Transco — is expected to have generated adjusted EBITDA of $636.5 million, down 2.4% from the year-earlier level.Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA projection for the Northeast G&amp;P unit — engaged in natural gas gathering and processing along with the NGL fractionation business in Marcellus and Utica shale regions — reflects a 1.7% year-over-year drop.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that The Williams Companies is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

Never be left in the dust again.MetaMeta (NASDAQ:META) popped 4.4% Thursday after the company said it pocketed $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32 billion, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.Morgan Stanley was ebullient on the results, hiking Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share and writing:META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.Bernstein raved:They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.Shares closed at $311.71.AlphabetAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares jumped after the search giant surpassed second-quarter analyst expectations, saying Tuesday after the close that it earned $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6B, driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.Story continuesAnalysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search &amp; other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, saying: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.Shares jumped 5.8% on Wednesday.MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground Wednesday after reporting the company's CFO warned on the earnings call that CapEx is expected to increase over the next several quarters as the tech giant races to meet strong AI demand.“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood noted on the earnings call.For the Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to driving meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on the timing of when these stepped-up investments will pay off:Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and lost another 2% to $330.72 in the next session.BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA) numbers topped second-quarter estimates as the U.S. plane maker also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.The company posted a loss of $0.82 per share on Wednesday, but that was $0.08 narrower than expected, and revenue of $19.75B - up 18% year over year - comfortably exceeded the $18.49B consensus, per analysts polled by Investing.com. Sales were driven by higher deliveries of its 787 model, and Boeing's commercial airplanes segment registered a 41% revenue surge to $8.84B.Boeing also raised its production plans for the 737 MAX up to 38 per month from 31 by the end of the year, in a sign that the planes are in heavy demand as airlines race to address a post-pandemic surge in travel.BofA upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral on these results and raised its price target by $75 to $300, arguing that the ""worst is behind"" for the company ""in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels.""The analyst added:We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analyst said in a note.Boeing soared 8.7% to $232.80 Wednesday and was recently adding more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.McDonald'sMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) shares rose 1.2% to $295.19 Thursday after the fast food behemoth beat on the top and bottom line in the second quarter on strong same-store sales.EPS surged 97% to $3.15, said the company, trouncing the $2.78 average analyst estimate. Revenues rose 14% in constant currencies to $6.5B, edging out the $6.29B consensus.The company reported that global comparable sales rose 11.7% for the quarter, far better than Wall Street's call for an 8.88% increase. U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3%.U.S. sales were boosted by strategic menu price increases and positive guest counts, the company said.""Our second quarter results reflect consistently strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski was quoted as saying in the accompanying press release. ""While global macroeconomic challenges persist, we continue to invest in our growth drivers and our brand.""Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, Scott Kanowsky, and Sarina Isaacs contributed to this report._______Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Meta delights, Microsoft warns in huge week for tech, AIAdidas plans next Yeezy stock sale in AugustCharter Communications earnings missed by $0.02, revenue fell short of estimates]"

206,81e99d77-ddb6-3716-8f9c-550e74770a76,BA,2023-07-28,3 Top Blue Chip Stocks to Ride the Dow Rally,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-blue-chip-stocks-122500594.html,1690460700,STORY,"['JNJ', 'WMT', 'BA', 'MMM', 'JPM']","[The Dow is experiencing a fantastic July, with the blue-chip index extending a winning streak not seen in decades, thanks to upbeat corporate earnings and the possibility of a pause in rate hikes soon.It, thus, makes sense to place bets on solid blue-chip players like JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Walmart Inc. WMT and Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ that can make the most of a Dow rally.Dow Seals Longest Winning Streak in 36 YearsAfter a volatile trading session on Jul 26, the Dow was able to clinch its longest winning streak since Jan 20, 1987, per Dow Jones Market Data. The 30-stock blue-chip index scaled upward by 82.05 points, or 0.23%, to register its 13th consecutive trading session in the green.The Dow’s latest milestone is now registered in the history books, and if the blue-chip gauge extends its winning streak for another trading session, it will notch its longest daily winning streak since June 1897, which was one year after the index was created in May 1896.Corporate Profits Are ImprovingThe Dow was able to hold onto its positive momentum as the latest corporate quarterly earnings results were mostly encouraging for the blue-chip stocks.3M Company’s MMM shares moved northward after the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat. Similarly, The Coca-Cola Company’s KO shares moved up on promising earnings results for the quarter that ended in June and a positive outlook for the rest of 2023.The Boeing Company’s BA shares also soared after the company’s free cash flow in the second quarter improved following an uptick in commercial aircraft deliveries.Fed Raises Rates But Could Pause AgainMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased its interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as prices of indispensable commodities remain above the central bank’s target of 2%.The Fed has hiked interest rates in 11 of its last 12 meetings, and now the benchmark overnight interest rates are 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in more than 22 years.Story continuesHowever, Fed Chair Jerome Powell did indicate that interest rate hikes may be paused shortly, as was done in the June meeting. The Fed remains data-driven, and the central bank may choose to hold rates steady in the September meeting.Market pundits are also betting on a rate hike pause in September. Almost 77.2% of them are expecting the Fed to pause rate hikes in the next meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Thus, chances of pausing rate hikes boosted investors’ sentiment and helped the Dow scale upward as well. After all, rate hikes impact consumer outlays, increase borrowing costs and hamper economic activities.3 Best Blue Chip Stocks for a Winning PortfolioBanking on such hopefulness, there will be a sharp run-up in the index of 30 stocks. The companies on the index are slated to advance further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, solid balance sheets, and steady cash flow.We have, thus, selected three such blue-chip stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.JPMorgan is one of the biggest global banks. Now, a possible rate hike pause may not bode well for the bank, but its strong liquidity position and recent strategic acquisitions should certainly help it chug along in the near term.JPMorgan has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JPM’s current-year earnings has moved up 7.9% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 25.8%. JPM’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5%.Walmart is now an omnichannel player and not just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer.

WMT’s estimated earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 5.5%.Johnson &amp; Johnson operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products divisions. While its MedTech division is enjoying strong fundamentals, the company remains engaged in expanding the labels of some of its marketed products.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.7% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5.7%.

It’s not.Last year, the California-based biotech firm Grail released a $950 test called Galleri that can identify trace signs of more than 50 types of cancers, including difficult-to-detect pancreatic and ovarian cancers, in the DNA of completely symptom-free people. One of the reasons there isn’t wider awareness of Galleri is that insurance companies do not yet cover such hyper-early diagnostic tools. Another holdup: Grail has been stuck in legal limbo for two years.In 2020, Illumina, the world’s leading maker of whole-genome sequencing machines, announced its intention to acquire the cancer test company for $8 billion. In the years since, Illumina has tussled with U.S. and EU regulators over whether an Illumina-Grail tie-up would be anticompetitive; closed the Grail deal over regulators’ objections; lost billions in market value; became embroiled in a no-holds-barred proxy battle with the notorious activist investor Carl Icahn; and witnessed the eventual defenestration of two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent Black executives: former CEO Francis deSouza and former chairman John Thompson.To Icahn’s supporters, the ouster of deSouza and Thompson, an effort staunchly championed by the billionaire investor, proves the 87-year-old still has relevance decades after he forged the corporate raider model. Insiders with a view into the last days of deSouza’s rule at Illumina, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, insist that Icahn’s financial case against the company was watertight and that the leadership problems at Illumina extended beyond the Grail debacle.But while Icahn takes a victory lap, others warn that the disruption at Illumina has slowed the development and deployment of a potentially lifesaving cancer test, one that’s expected to be a part of President Biden’s “moonshot” goal to dramatically reduce cancer deaths in the U.S. Moreover, biotech, an industry lacking diversity, has lost a champion of inclusion in deSouza.Story continuesOne could make the argument that many of deSouza’s strategies were not as inexplicable as Icahn claimed; at worst, the CEO was overconfident in his ability to dominate a new market opportunity, and, at best, he wanted to save lives by quickly moving Galleri into mainstream medicine. DeSouza’s defenders say timing—the rise of aggressive regulators, the decline in biotech stocks—was the real barrier to a successful merger.In the end, however, deSouza’s fate at Illumina may more accurately be seen as a cautionary tale of overzealous CEO ambition, a case where one man’s desire to burnish a lasting image temporarily led one of the country’s most innovative companies astray.The startup that billionaires lovedDeSouza was a rising star in Silicon Valley when Jay Flatley, Illumina’s then-CEO, recruited him from cybersecurity firm Symantec to become the biotech company’s president in 2013. The newcomer was tasked with growing the company’s clinical business to boost revenue. At the time, the firm almost exclusively served the research market.The same year that deSouza arrived at Illumina, a pathologist in the company’s prenatal testing business discovered that A.I. could identify trace fragments of cancer in certain parts of DNA. This eureka moment would eventually lead to the Galleri test years after Illumina created and spun off Grail. The startup attracted investments from the deepest pockets, including billionaires like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, while Illumina held on to a 12% stake. Upon orchestrating Grail’s launch in 2016, Flatley stepped down as Illumina’s CEO, with deSouza replacing him and Flatley becoming executive chairman.According to several people familiar with deSouza’s tenure, the new CEO was an effective leader—at least initially. Icahn himself would later say that deSouza did a “good job” of running Illumina’s core business, developing and selling the company’s million-dollar genome sequencers. As president, deSouza successfully expanded the company’s clinical labs business, a market that grew to rival its research enterprise. Diversity also improved at the firm, with deSouza—of Indian, Ethiopian, and Greek descent—increasing the number of people of color and women in top positions.Outside the firm, deSouza used his perch to call attention to the lack of representation in pharma companies and, as a result, racial biases in genomics. Part of deSouza’s mission was to make Illumina’s DNA data bank representative of racial diversity in the U.S. and globally. (DeSouza declined to comment on the record for the story. Icahn didn’t respond in time for publication.)As CEO, deSouza focused on further expanding the clinical market—which today accounts for more than half of the company's revenue, according to one source—and building an overseas presence. He also prepared for the company’s next big release: the NovaSeq X, expected to cut the cost of sequencing an entire human genome to as low as $200, down from $150,000 in Illumina’s early years. However, that product—a $1.2 million machine—wouldn’t ship until the first quarter of 2023.With the company’s financials weakening and distant competitors gaining ground, deSouza looked for M&amp;A targets. He’d taken over at Illumina after a period of rapid growth, as one insider said, following in the footsteps of ex-CEO Flatley, who had transformed the company from 30 employees in 1999 to nearly 5,000 by 2015. Revenues grew from under $1 million per year to $2.2 billion under the former CEO; deSouza, having inherited a more mature company, was expected to define Illumina’s next act and bring revenues to $5 billion annually. (Revenues reached $4.5 billion in 2022.)But for deSouza, the acquisition path led to dead ends.First, Illumina failed at a 2020 attempt to pick up Pacific Biosciences of California, which specializes in a different form of sequencing. The FTC effectively kiboshed the merger by challenging the company over anticompetitive concerns. That didn’t deter deSouza from pursuing Grail, which was preparing for an IPO then. Grail appeared less risky since it produced cancer tests, not sequencers. The FTC had never successfully challenged a vertical merger, the company would later remind shareholders and the press.Grail became deSouza’s, well, holy grail. He took many—perhaps too many—opportunities to talk up Grail in press appearances, yoking his name to the project. “It’s a blood test, a simple blood draw that looks for 50 cancers across all stages in your blood,” he told CNBC just this April. “Ten million people a year die of cancer, and we know that if you catch cancers early, your odds of surviving are much higher than if you catch it later.” He also argued that Illumina was the best company to help accelerate Grail’s development since the larger firm was already established in 150 countries and had the relationships and know-how to make the test reimbursable for patients.That noble mission may partly explain deSouza’s interest in Grail, but the financial incentives for Illumina were also significant. The merger would have given Illumina a toehold in a still-emerging market for multi-cancer early detection tests, where Grail was positioned to become a force.Whether Grail was as valuable as deSouza believed is debatable. In January, Flatley—who was still executive chair when Illumina announced the Grail bid—told the Financial Times that the company bought in at the top of the market, spending $8 billion (including Illumina’s existing stake) for a startup that would not be cash-flow positive for 10 years. Although Flatley was on the board when the deal was approved and voted in favor of the purchase, he had reportedly advocated for allowing Grail to go public and reassessing whether to buy it in a few years. But deSouza had stopped taking advice from the former CEO, who was left out of most leadership meetings by this time and saw his remit limited to a few internal projects, according to a source close to the events.A second source offers a contradictory take, telling Fortune that deSouza regularly consulted with Flatley on the Grail deal, inviting Flatley to meetings appropriate for his new board role. But Flatley and other members of Illumina’s old guard, the executive contends, might have felt pushed aside when deSouza made changes meant to democratize decision-making at the firm.To be fair, CEOs are expected to press forward with their own agendas and establish their authority after taking control of a company. In Silicon Valley lore, a CEO’s most valuable tool is not the former chief executive but their gut instincts. Who could blame deSouza for asserting his independence?""With Francis’s leadership, and the support of the Board, the Illumina team transformed the company to be more clinical, more global, and more digital,"" Thompson told Fortune in a statement. ""This gives people around the world more access to the power of genomics, makes the genome more reflective of our diverse world, and positions Illumina well by dramatically expanding the market.”In fact, there is a world where Grail would have looked like a brilliant purchase, as many believe that the market for cancer screening could one day make Grail a bigger company than Illumina (assuming Grail clears FDA regulatory hurdles). Even antitrust regulators’ interest in the Illumina-Grail merger underscores why deSouza almost pulled off a pivot for the ages. Had the merger happened seamlessly, Illumina would be part of a market forecasted to grow to $44 billion by 2027. Presumably, this was an opportunity that deSouza did not want to miss, the way that Microsoft slept through the rise of mobile computing, or Yahoo, which once declined to buy Google, watched that rival develop search.Nor did deSouza act impulsively. Before bidding for Grail, Illumina later explained, the company hired external experts and sought advice from legal counsel in the EU, U.S., and U.K. to assess the likelihood of any regulatory hurdles. The risk was not zero, because Grail and a handful of his nascent-stage competitors rely on Illumina’s sequencers to process their tests. But trusted advisors said the deal looked safe because the FTC would not likely take on a vertical merger. And in the EU, the company did not have revenue nor immediate plans to earn income (Grail only operated in the U.K.), which meant it wouldn’t fall under the EU’s jurisdiction. Or so Illumina believed.Just before the bid was announced, the company’s market value stood at an all-time high of $75 billion. It wouldn’t last. Investors disagreed with Illumina’s calculus, and the company’s stock price dropped after announcing its intention to buy Grail in the fall of 2020. Analysts correctly warned that the company could scuffle with U.S. regulators and questioned whether Grail was worth the hefty price tag.A new era for regulatorsDeSouza and Illumina’s quest for Grail soon became roadkill in a new regulatory rush to block consolidation in tech, including biotech. The FTC sued to stop the Illumina-Grail deal in 2021, making the company an early portent of the commission’s new order under Chair Lina Khan. Months later, when the EU’s antitrust watchdog warned that it was reviewing the merger and could force Illumina to unwind Grail, the regulator leaned on what’s known as Article 22, a legal clause allowing it to review mergers for companies that could eventually operate in Europe and monopolize that market. This new interpretation of the law was a first. If there’s one point deSouza’s critics and defenders agree on, it’s that the EU’s decision to intervene blindsided everyone.DeSouza and his board were in a tough spot, the first victims of what the company saw as an effort by the EU and the U.S. to use coordinated delay tactics to block large companies pursuing acquisitions. It was a lose-lose scenario: If Illumina waited for the legal processes to play out in both jurisdictions, it would miss the closing deadline. If it dropped the purchase, it would need to pay a breakup fee of about $300 million under the deal’s terms. And if it closed the deal, it would incur a fine of over $450 million (the fee would be 10% of the company’s revenues) for closing before the EU’s review was complete. That fee, however, would be refunded if the company successfully challenged the EU’s right to interfere in the merger. DeSouza and the board—with its former CEO allegedly forced out as lead director and Microsoft chair and former Symantec CEO John Thompson now the independent chair—proceeded with the purchase, closing in 2021. (Flatley declined to comment on the record for this story.)Such a bold, exceedingly rare move shocked investors, although not everyone condemned the decision. One analyst called deSouza a “maverick,” while an unnamed investor told the Financial Times that Grail was a “natural extension” of Illumina’s technology. Still, the consensus was that the gamble would be ruinous. Details about the Galleri test’s promise, the size of the future cancer diagnostic market, and deSouza’s financial judgment were all lost in the flap. Grail had become a distraction, analysts complained. Eventually, the legal melee would weigh on Illumina’s once-soaring share price, which would fall more than 60% before Icahn joined the brawl.Today, Illumina is still waiting for a ruling from an EU court over whether the EU Commission has jurisdiction to block its Grail deal. As expected, in July, the company was required to pay the EU $476 million in a record-setting fine for completing the acquisition. The company says it set the sum aside in anticipation of the fine. In the U.S., Illumina triumphed over the FTC when one of the commission’s administrative judges sided with the company. But the commission later ordered the company to spin off Grail anyway. The FTC rejected Illumina’s assertion that blocking the merger put lives at stake. Illumina’s claims about Grail were “vague, self-serving, and unsupported,” the agency declared. “Letting competition spur through innovation among MCED [multi-cancer early detection] test providers would do more to save lives than allowing a monopolist to vertically integrate and capture the market.”This time, the company pushed back with constitutional claims that will be heard by a federal appeals judge and could eventually land before the Supreme Court.Icahn launches a proxy battleBefore Icahn made his involvement public, he held private talks with Thompson and deSouza. The company offered to accept one board member from team Icahn to deter a proxy battle. It also promised to add an independent director whom Illumina would select. Icahn insisted on two or three board seats, saying he “would not even support Jesus Christ” as a company candidate.By Icahn’s calculations, the Grail debacle cost the company $50 billion in value. That big number gave weight to his campaign, which he publicly unveiled in mid-March, boosting the stock price by 17%. With his signature colorful language, Icahn’s opening salvo to shareholders declared that something was “rotten in the state of Illumina,” where the company’s “Rip van Winkle” board had allowed a manipulative CEO to destroy billions in market value by pursuing Grail.Icahn proposed three nominees for Illumina’s board, all of whom would answer directly to him and replace three of Illumina’s sitting members: Robert Epstein, a biotech veteran and Illumina’s longest-serving director; Thompson, the independent chair; and deSouza, who had a board seat. “It is easy for them to say they should fight on forever, as they have no skin in the game,” Icahn said of the company’s determination to cling to the Grail deal. “They are literally fighting a war with our money.”Icahn, who had built less than a 1.5% stake in Illumina, didn’t focus all of his ire on the Grail purchase. In a series of open letters, he took issue with the company’s increased spending on R&amp;D and called attention to deSouza’s pay package, which had nearly doubled to $27 million in 2022. He also accused deSouza of personally recruiting Thompson, supposedly deSouza’s “buddy” from his days at Symantec. (Both men also had ties to Microsoft, where deSouza had worked before joining Symantec.) As the proxy battle continued, Icahn went further down this rabbit hole. “We wonder how chairman John Thompson and CEO Francis deSouza can continue with straight faces to minimize their extensive relationship,” he wrote in a May letter, arguing that Thompson might be “technically independent” but could not hold deSouza accountable.Few could, at least according to comments from Icahn echoed by an insider who spoke to Fortune. They claimed that deSouza was not a leader who considered the counsel of others before making strategic decisions. Rather, he sidelined executives who disagreed with him. In Icahn’s version of Illumina’s history, top talent left the company owing to deSouza’s domineering style, and the CEO couldn’t replenish those seats.On this point, defenders of the maligned CEO disagree. They argue that DeSouza had led a leadership shake-up to bring in world-class talent with clinical expertise and introduce diversity to the company’s top ranks. Icahn also blamed what he characterized as a too-deferential board for allowing this talent drain. Even putting Grail aside, he said, deSouza’s ability to lead Illumina was in question.As is his wont, Icahn dragged deSouza’s personal life and an ugly divorce into the limelight, further publicizing details about the CEO’s marriage history revealed during the FTC’s case against the Grail deal. In 2020, a San Francisco court ruled that deSouza hid millions in crypto earnings from his wife when the couple dissolved their marriage. The case, known as the first “Bitcoin divorce,” fed into Icahn’s narrative that deSouza was untrustworthy.But the dual decision to acquire Grail—for too much money, in Icahn’s opinion—and plow ahead with the deal despite regulator pushbacks got the most Icahn ink. “Someone should have mentioned to our ‘genius board’ that fighting a huge government agency involving antitrust is not like fighting a competitor, especially when you just insulted the regulatory agency,” he wrote in his initial letter.In April, Icahn told the trade publication GenEdge that Illumina was wasting money and energy on Grail, which Illumina was forced to fund, instead of stockpiling cash to protect its status at the world’s largest genome sequencer and improve profit margins that had suffered to the point where the company announced a cost-cutting plan. Icahn wanted his men on the board to force the company to back out of the merger, which Illumina retorted was legally impossible. It was obligated to hold on to Grail until receiving a divestiture order from the EU, but it had also begun divestiture preparation. That wrinkle made little difference to Icahn, who called for deSouza’s expulsion and for Flatley to come out of retirement to retake control. The former CEO, Icahn said, was in high demand among employees who reached out to his team.Illumina defends its board and CEOThe company responded to Icahn’s attacks with talking points centered on Grail’s potential as a future biotech blockbuster and an urgency to get the Galleri test into more hands. It also explained the company’s reasoning for pursuing the Grail deal.The board and deSouza met several times to weigh their options, inviting input from various experts, as they had before starting the acquisition. They were advised that the FTC likely wouldn’t win an appeal in a federal court based on past precedent. That advice may still prove to be accurate. Just last week, a Biden-appointed federal judge granted Microsoft a victory in its FTC fight to buy video game company Activision Blizzard. The company’s case in the EU also appeared solid.Illumina had also told regulators that it would draw contracts guaranteeing Grail’s future competitors fair prices and access to its sequencers. It justified deSouza’s pay by pointing out that it was tied to the NovaSeq X’s release—the company’s first new launch in five years—not the Grail deal. The CEO had not cherry-picked its board, the company said. Thompson and deSouza only worked together briefly at Symantec, and the board recruited Thompson through its usual nomination and vetting process. In its letters to shareholders, the company cited Thompson’s “40 years of experience leading companies through periods of transformative growth and value creation,” noting that the IBM veteran had led the board at Microsoft responsible for Satya Nadella’s CEO appointment.Neither Icahn nor Illumina made racial diversity a focal point of their arguments in support of their candidates, but it would have been hard for shareholders to miss the significance of the proxy battle just by looking at the slates on both sides. Icahn nominated three white men; two of the three incumbent candidates he wanted off the board were Black.Still, ahead of Illumina’s AGM, in May, advisory firm Glass Lewis issued its verdict in the proxy battle, siding with Icahn by withholding its support for Thompson and deSouza and calling the Grail deal a “self-made boondoggle” for which the board was not taking responsibility. ISS, by contrast, recommended that shareholders reelect deSouza to the board, which they did. Epstein, the board member with the longest tenure, also survived the vote, but Thompson did not receive enough support to remain chair, losing to Icahn’s candidate, Andrew Teno, a portfolio manager at Icahn Enterprises. It was the first time in a decade that a large-cap North American company voted out its chairman, according to data from Diligent’s Insightia.Though it’s impossible to know for sure, the results of the proxy battle were likely influenced by the recent introduction of the universal proxy card, which allows shareholders to choose from either the company’s slate of directors or the dissident’s. Now investors can elect one or two activist nominees on a “What’s the harm?” basis, says Insightia’s editor-in-chief, Josh Black.Icahn’s victory wasn’t surprising, given Illumina’s financial hit after the Grail deal. Icahn plugged into a feeling from investors that deSouza was steering what had been a reliable moneymaker in the wrong direction. And although Icahn had suffered his own brutal attack on his holding company, Icahn Enterprises, from short-seller Hindenburg Research, he still had the capital and savvy to get his way at Illumina.Icahn’s influence became even more pronounced when deSouza, who had handily survived his proxy vote, resigned as CEO and director on June 11. That left Illumina with an almost entirely white board. In his goodbye memo to staff, deSouza maintained his faith in Grail, writing, “My belief in the potential of Grail’s potentially lifesaving technology and the benefits of merging it with Illumina remains unshakable.”The future of Illumina, Grail, and deSouzaToday, Grail’s fate as an Illumina subsidiary remains unknown. (Grail representatives declined to comment.) The parent company won’t have its case questioning the EU’s jurisdiction heard until around the first quarter of 2024, though a divestiture order could come before that. In the U.S., several Republican attorneys general have called the FTC’s veto of the merger an overreach, while the American Hospital Association and a bipartisan group of lawmakers and public health advocates have signed amicus briefs supporting Illumina’s case at the federal appeals court, which is set to begin in September.For now, Grail is selling its test through a waiver program since it is not yet FDA-approved. In June, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill allowing Medicare to cover the cost of a multi-cancer early detection test. Advocates for the bill say that making such cancer tests easy to access, especially in rural areas, would help close racial and income health disparities among older Americans. The company may know by December whether Medicare will cover Galleri. In the meantime, it’s running clinical studies, including one with 140,000 subjects, in partnership with the U.K.’s National Health Service. Grail has also publicized cases where it identified cancer cells later confirmed by MRI in U.S. patients.The U.S. National Cancer Institute is preparing a double-blind trial to see whether early cancer detection positively impacts cancer screenings or puts patients at risk of overdiagnosis. Though the test intuitively sounds like a win for humanity, public health experts say it’s not that clear-cut. “One concern is that because early cancer detection with a blood test is such an attractive idea, it could be tough to find people willing to be part of the control group,” Science magazine wrote.At Illumina, Charles Dadswell, the general counsel, is now interim CEO, and the company says it’s searching for a successor. Illumina did not say when the next CEO might be named, but a source says Flatley is interested and would likely return if asked. However, the boomerang CEO route wouldn’t be a long-term solution, meaning the company would need to endure another CEO transition in a few years.Under deSouza, Illumina said it would unwind Grail if it loses either appeal. If it wins, deciding whether to keep Grail will be up to the forthcoming CEO’s discretion. It’s possible the next leader won’t wait for the legal process to play out before signaling an intention to sell Grail, no matter what happens with regulators. That would be an investor-backed solution, particularly with Icahn, who wants to see Illumina refocused on its bread-and-butter genome sequencing business.As it happens, Illumina’s core business could ultimately still help brand deSouza’s legacy at Illumina. The NovaSeq X launched in January to strong demand, and analysts will see sales results for the instruments in the year’s second half. If the launch proves successful, says RBC analyst Conor McNamara, deSouza would deserve much of the credit.By then, however, a new CEO will be in charge, assuming Illumina acts quickly. More likely, deSouza’s lasting image will not be that of a trailblazer who took big swings, stuck to his vision, caught a market on the rise, attempted to deliver a potentially lifesaving test to the masses, defied regulators, and pulled off a major product launch. Instead, fairly or not, he’ll be the once-promising leader who came perilously close to hollowing out an iconic company.   This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

209,07dae458-bfd8-35e5-bf07-098c3982b4bd,ILMN,2023-07-28,Budi Hermawan’s Long Fight Against Tuberculosis,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/budi-hermawan-long-fight-against-134000899.html,1690465200,STORY,['ILMN'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 27, 2023 / Illumina:Originally published on Illumina News CenterNothing about Budi Hermawan's experience with tuberculosis (TB) has been easy. In 2003, he had a cough. He didn't think much of it, but as his symptoms worsened, he visited a doctor near his home in Bogor, Indonesia. He was diagnosed with TB and given medication, but eventually, he stopped taking the drugs.Hermawan did not understand the disease or how important it was to continue his medicines. A few months later, his symptoms returned. He went back to the doctor, who strongly urged him to take all his medications. He did, but his disease continued to worsen.""It was a long process, and I only had limited information,"" says Hermawan. ""It also affected my psychological and economic situation, as I was not able to work properly or be productive due to the disease.""Finally, in 2010, his TB had worsened to the point where he was considering having a lung removed. This was an expensive proposition, and he had little money. Hermawan consulted with his family, and he took two months to raise the funds before he returned to the hospital. That delay proved fortuitous-a new treatment was now available and meant he would no longer need surgery.The hospital tested Hermawan's sputum (saliva and mucus) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a strain of the disease that is able to resist two of the most powerful anti-TB drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid. In those days, fast molecular tests were not available, and it took three months to get the results. Hermawan had to wear a mask the whole time to protect his family. Eventually, his results came back positive, and he was told to start treatment.At the time, only one facility, Persahabatan Hospital in Jakarta, provided the treatment. Either he would have to commute via bus, train, and taxi four hours each day, or he would have to move to the capital.Story continuesFor nearly two years, Hermawan took about 30 tablets a day, received daily injections, and went in for monthly exams. For the first four months, he moved to Jakarta to protect his family; then, once he was negative for TB, he moved back to Bogor-but the treatment continued for 17 months.""It is extraordinary because the treatment is 21 months long and patients have to reconcile with the situation,"" says Hermawan, whose story is unfortunately not uncommon. MDR-TB is more difficult and takes longer to treat than drug-susceptible TB. ""Family support is very important, as well as support from fellow survivors.""Supporting TB education and treatment Hermawan's experience inspired him to help others, and he joined a number of drug-resistant TB support groups, including Jakarta MDR-TB Fighters. Now he leads POP-TB Indonesia, which provides advocacy, education, and patient support.This work is informed by his experiences. Hermawan thinks about the three-month period when he was waiting to learn whether he had MDR-TB and was a danger to his family and community.Things are a bit better now. Some Indonesian clinics have adopted molecular tests, which can process results in as little as two hours. And on July 25, following the results of a Unitaid-FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics) trial, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced its endorsement of next-generation sequencing for diagnostic testing of drug-resistant TB. This further expands drug resistant testing capability to get patients to the correct course of treatment faster. But even with this fast technology, infrastructure issues can slow the process.""Theoretically, the results come out in two hours, but on the ground, the results come out in two weeks or even a month,"" Hermawan says. ""The human resource factor is very influential; they are not ready. There are conditions where the equipment is available but damaged. This is a challenge we face on the ground.""And for patients, there are many layers to the experience: the social stigma, the difficulty accessing effective therapies, the economic hardships associated with the disease and even the treatments.""We work to educate and motivate fellow survivors,"" says Hermawan. ""We can also advocate for patients because we have legal representatives. Currently, we have 36 representatives for POP-TB. Regarding mental health, we have 14 mental health responders for the hotline, and we also collaborate with psychologists.""Hermawan used to meet individually with MDR-TB patients, but he realized that approach was unsustainable-there are just too many. He now leverages POP-TB's resources to provide that necessary support, though he does occasionally intervene in person.""There was a patient, a few months ago, who called me and told me she had nothing to eat,"" he says. ""This is terrible. TB medication must be accompanied by good nutrition. I ordered food for her and her family and the next morning my team and I found her. Her house was uninhabitable. I advocated for her, and she is being rehabilitated by philanthropic organizations. Before that she missed treatments; after she was never absent, and now she is cured.""There's a lot more work to be done. TB is the second-leading infectious disease killer worldwide, behind COVID-19. In 2022, WHO reported that globally, the number of adults and children receiving treatment for MDR- and rifampicin-resistant TB fell 43% short and 15% short, respectively, of United Nations five-year targets set in 2018. Hermawan is grateful to Illumina and other companies for their support, while noting that resources remain scarce and patients rely on POP-TB and other organizations to help them successfully complete their treatments.""We have to convey information to the patient,"" he says. ""Sometimes, doctors will declare the patient cured, but they still have to continue treatment even though the microscope has no longer found germs.

This finding was confirmed in an official letter received by Southern Nuclear and signifies that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations.(PRNewsfoto/Georgia Power)No further NRC findings are necessary in order for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup sequence for the new unit.The issuance of the 103(g) finding follows years of diligent and careful work by the team at the site to submit documentation that Unit 4 has satisfied 364 required inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAACs) as outlined in Southern Nuclear's Combined License – helping ensure the unit meets strict nuclear safety and quality standards. This process was completed on July 20, and the NRC conducted a thorough review process of each submission and targeted inspections of the facility before issuing the 103(g) finding. As required by the NRC, each ITAAC had to be verified before fuel load and operations.The team at the site continues working diligently to make final preparations for Unit 4 fuel load, initiate startup testing and bring the unit online. Well-trained and highly qualified nuclear technicians will continue work required to support loading fuel, which is already onsite, into the unit's reactor. This will be followed by several months of startup testing and operations. Startup testing is designed to demonstrate the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Operators will also bring the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronize the Unit to the grid and systematically raise power to 100%.Story continuesThe new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, each of the new units can produce enough electricity to power an estimated 500,000 homes and businesses.

Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today. After some brief prepared comments, the management team will be available to answer questions.I will now turn the call over to Eric.Story continuesH. Eric BoltonThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Leasing conditions across the MAA portfolio continued to reflect our steady employment markets, strong positive migration trends and continued low resident turnover. As a result, we are seeing good demand for apartment housing and are absorbing the new supply deliveries while supporting solid rent growth. In line with normal seasonal patterns, new lease pricing improved in the second quarter and the spread between new lease pricing and renewal pricing narrowed.Rents for new move-in residents jumped 100 basis points higher on a sequential basis as compared to the preceding first quarter. Renewal lease pricing in the second quarter remained strong, growing by 6.8%, driving overall blended pricing performance in Q2 to 3.8%, which is ahead of the original projections we had for the year.Occupancy remains steady with average physical occupancy in the second quarter at 95.5%, which is consistent with the preceding first quarter, this despite a higher number of lease expirations during the second quarter. While we are working through a higher level of new supply deliveries across our markets for the next few quarters, with the demand trends holding up as they are, we expect to continue to drive top line results that will exceed our long-term historical averages as has been the case in prior cycles of higher supply, we see the demand supply dynamic holding up slightly better in our mid-tier markets and this component of our strategy continues to bring support to overall portfolio performance during this part of the cycle.As described in our first quarter report, we do expect to see moderation in year-over-year growth in operating expenses as inflation pressures ease a bit and some of the efficiencies we expect to capture from new tech initiatives increasingly make an impact. As Al will cover in his comments, we do now also expect to see some relief on property taxes coming out of Texas, which further supports our ability to reduce our outlook for expense growth over the back half of the year.The transaction market remains quiet. We continue to underwrite a few deals, but the limited number of properties coming to market, combined with strong investor interest continues to support low cap rates and strong pricing. We continue to expect that more compelling opportunities will emerge later this year and into 2024 and believe it's important to remain patient with our balance sheet capacity. Our new lease-up, new development and redevelopment pipelines will all continue to make solid progress and will provide attractive incremental additional earnings over the next few years.I did want to take a moment and express my deep appreciation to our on-site property teams for all their hard work and great service to our residents during these busy summer months.And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brad.Adrian Bradley HillThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen each quarter over the past year or so, second quarter transaction activity remains muted versus normal levels. Volatility and uncertainty in the debt market continued to cause the majority of sellers to postpone their sales processes, leading to a drop of more sale inventory on the market. For high-quality, well-located properties in our region of the country, there continues to be strong investor demand, causing cap rates to adjust slower than interest rate movements alone would indicate.Having said that, we have seen an average buyer cap rates move up to 4.9% in the second quarter from 4.7% in the first quarter, with most cap rates ranging between 4.75% and 5.25%. We continue to believe we're likely to see more compelling acquisition opportunities later this year and into next. So we remain patient as we wait for the market to continue to adjust. We are actively reviewing a number of acquisition opportunities, but with no potential acquisitions under contract at the moment.We've lowered our acquisition forecast for the year to $200 million at the midpoint. Our acquisition team remains active in the market and AL and his team have our balance sheet in great shape and ready to quickly support any transaction opportunity should it materialize.Due to the lower funds needed for expected acquisitions, we've also lowered our disposition forecast for the year to $100 million at the midpoint. Our properties in their initial lease up continue to outperform our original expectations, producing higher NOIs and higher earnings and creating additional long-term value for the company.These properties are navigating the increased supply pressure well and on average have captured in-place rents 22% above our original expectations. For the 4 properties that are either leasing or we'll start leasing in the third quarter, this rent outperformance, which is partially offset by higher taxes and insurance is estimated to produce an average stabilized NOI yield of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than our original expectations for these properties.Early leasing is going well at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta, and we expect to start leasing at Novel Val Vista in Phoenix in the third quarter.During the second quarter, we also reached stabilization at MAA Loso in Charlotte. Despite permitting and approval processes that are taking a bit longer than we anticipated, predevelopment work continues to progress on a number of projects. we expect 3 projects will be ready to start construction in the back half of 2023, if we see sufficient adjustments to construction costs and rents to support our NOI yield expectations.These projects include 2 in-house developments, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Denver and 1 prepurchased joint venture development in Charlotte. We've pushed back the start of the Phase 2 to our West Midtown prepurchase development in Atlanta to the 2024 due to the approval process taking longer than anticipated.The team continues to work through the increased prepurchase development opportunities that have been presented to us, and we're hopeful we will be able to add additional currently unidentified development opportunities to our pipeline. Any project we start over the next 12 to 18 months would likely deliver in 2026 or 2027, and should be well positioned to capitalize on what we believe is likely to be a much stronger leasing environment. Reflecting the significant slowdown in new starts expected over the balance of 2023 and 2024.Our construction management team remains focused on completing and delivering our 6 under-construction projects, and they're doing a tremendous job managing these projects and working with our contractors to minimize the impact of inflationary and supply chain pressures as well as labor constraints on our development costs and schedules. During the quarter, the team successfully completed and accepted delivery of the combined 249 units at Novel Daybreak in Salt Lake City and Novel West Midtown in Atlanta. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments.So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.Timothy P. ArgoThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenue growth for the quarter was essentially in line with our expectations with stable occupancy, low resident turnover and better blended rent performance than what we previously projected. Despite increasing supply pressure in some of our markets, blended lease-over-lease pricing of 3.8% comprised of new lease growth of 0.5% and renewal growth of 6.8% was better than our forecasted expectations. While occupancy was slightly below our expected range for the quarter, the resulting higher blended lease growth performance is a favorable trade-off providing a greater future compounding growth effect.As discussed last quarter, we expected new lease pricing to show a typical seasonality that is to accelerate from the first quarter and renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 to moderate some, but still provide the catalyst to strong second quarter pricing performance.As Eric mentioned, this played out as expected with new lease pricing accelerating 100 basis points as compared to the first quarter and renewal pricing remaining strong. Alongside the pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained consistent with the first quarter at 95.5%, contributing to overall same-store revenue growth of 8.1%.The various demand factors we monitor remained strong in the second quarter with 60-day exposure, which represents all current vacant units plus those units would notice to vacate over the next 60 days, largely consistent with prior year at 8.5% versus 8.4% in the second quarter of last year.Furthermore, Quarterly resident turnover was down almost 2% from the prior year. Move-ins from markets outside of our footprint ticked up slightly from Q1 to 13% and rent to income ticked down slightly from Q1 to 22%. The employment market remains relatively strong also, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. While lead volume trails the record demand scenarios we saw in 2021 and 2022, it is up from 2018 and 2019. And last years where we experienced a more normal demand curve.Our prospect engagement platform that combines AI, marketing, automation and scheduled human engagement has enabled us to engage with prospects more effectively. July to date, pricing remains ahead of our original expectations with blended pricing of 3.2%. This is comprised of new lease pricing of 0.3% and renewal pricing of 5.5%. The new lease pricing is relatively consistent with the 0.5% for the second quarter and within 5 basis points of June new lease pricing.As expected, renewal pricing is moderating to a more normal range as leases are beginning to expire that were signed in the period last year when renewal rents had caught up to new lease rents. Physical occupancy is currently 95.6% with average daily occupancy for July month to date of 95.3%. The current July occupancy and July exposure, which is even with the prior year 7.5%, puts us in a good position for the remainder of the quarter.A key part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets, submarkets, asset types and price points. As we compete with elevated supply deliveries, particularly in some of our larger markets, many of our mid-tier markets are performing well and leading the portfolio and pricing performance, both in the second quarter and into July. Savannah, Charleston, Richmond, Kansas City, Greenville and Raleigh are all outperforming the overall portfolio. We expect that this market diversification, combined with continued strong demand fundamentals will help mitigate the impact of new supply that we expect to be elevated over the next several quarters.Regarding redevelopment, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives in the second quarter. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of Smart Home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the second quarter of 2023, we completed nearly 1,900 interior unit upgrades and installed nearly 2,300 Smart Home packages. We are nearing completion on the Smart Home initiative and now have over 92,000 units with this technology and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023.For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 15 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on cost in the upper teens. We have another 5 projects that will begin repricing in the third quarter and are evaluating an additional group of properties to potentially begin construction later in 2023. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments.Now I'll turn the call over to Al.Albert M. CampbellOkay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO for the quarter, $2.28 per share was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable interest in overhead costs during the quarter, and a large portion of the overhead cost favorability is timing related with the cost now expected to be incurred in the back half of the year.Overall, same-store operating performance for the quarter was essentially in line with expectations. As Tim mentioned, blended lease pricing continues to outperform original expectations for the year and build stronger-than-expected longer-term revenue but was primarily offset in the second quarter by average occupancy slightly below forecast.Also, as expected, we began to see moderation in same-store operating expense growth during the second quarter with the growth of personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate expenses, tax expenses, excuse me, which combined represents 70% of total operating costs, all reflecting moderation from the prior quarter. We expect moderation for these items to continue through the remainder of the year, particularly for real estate taxes, which we'll discuss more with guidance in just a moment.As mentioned in the release, our annual property and casualty insurance programs renewed on July 1, and with combined premium increase of approximately 20%, which is in line with our prior guidance. During the quarter, we invested a total of $26.3 million of capital through our redevelopment, repositioning and smart reinstallation programs producing strong returns and adding to the quality of our portfolio.We also funded just over $51 million of development costs during the quarter toward the completion of the current $735 million pipeline, leaving $344 million remaining to be funded. As Brad mentioned, we also expect to start several new deals over the next 12 to 18 months, likely expanding our development pipeline to be closer to $1 billion, which our balance sheet remains well positioned to support.We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in combined cash and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, providing significant safety and future opportunity. Our leverage remains historically low, the debt-to-EBITDA at 3.4x, and our debt is currently 100% fixed, for an average of 7.5 years at a record low 3.4%. We do have $350 million of debt maturing in the fourth quarter but our current plan is to remain patient and allow interest rates and financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next few quarters before refinancing with long-term debt.And finally, given the second quarter's earnings performance and the expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising our core FFO and several other areas of our guidance previously provided. With the blended pricing outperformance achieved through the second quarter, we are increasing the midpoint of our effective rent growth guidance to 7.25%, a 25 basis points increase. This is offset by a decrease in our physical occupancy guidance, which is now projected to average 95.5% for the full year, a 30 basis points decrease.Though this trade-off support slightly higher rental earning going forward, our total revenue growth guidance for this year remains unchanged at the midpoint of 6.25%. In early July, the Texas state legislature passed the tax overhaul which significantly rolled back property tax rates across the state to effectively redistribute a budget surplus. Given aggressive property valuations, we had previously anticipated rate rollbacks in Texas, where we have now added a specific reduction for this legislation, which lowers our overall same-store real estate tax growth rate for the year by 50 basis points to 5.75% at the midpoint and that's $0.02 per share to core FFO for the year.There's still limited information regarding exactly how individual counties and municipalities will push this change through but our guidance now includes our early estimate of this overall impact, which is expected to be ongoing.In summary, we are increasing our core FFO projections for the full year to a midpoint of $9.14 per share, which is an increase of $0.03 per share. This increase is primarily comprised of a carry-through of $0.01 per share from the second quarter performance -- outperformance as well as the $0.02 per share addition related to the Texas legislation. As Brad mentioned, we also revised our transaction volume expectations for the current year to reflect current market conditions. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments.So Aaron, we will now turn the call back to you for any questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)And we will take our first question from Eric Wolfe with Citi.Eric WolfeApologies if I missed this in your remarks, but could you just tell us the blended rent growth you're expecting sort of for the full year now, that's been revised upward and then what that would be in the back half of the year as well?Albert M. CampbellYes, Eric, this is Al. We had started the year, if you remember, with 3% for the full year, but the outperformance we've seen through the first half, that's increased that. So I think for the full year, we didn't put that in our guidance. But if you do the math on it, it's about 3.5% for this year. And that means largely sticking to the 3% for most of the back half, though we started in July, as Tim talked about stronger than that. So you're probably averaging [3.2, 3.132] for the back half and that projection now.Eric WolfeGot it. Makes sense. And then you mentioned that new lease rates did come up as you expected in the second quarter, as you would expect, seasonally but there's still a pretty wide gap between new lease and renewal rate growth. So I was just trying to understand what your sort of expectation would be for new lease growth in the back half of the year? And then thinking through whether that's actually a good sort of proxy for market rent growth should the 2 kind of be around the same?Timothy P. ArgoEric, this is Tim. With new lease growth, we did, as you said, we saw it accelerate some as we expected. It didn't accelerate quite as much as what we would see in a normal environment. I do think there's a little bit of supply pressure impact on that. Having said that, I don't really expect it to decelerate as much as it normally might would in Q3. It's typically kind of around this time that you start seeing new lease pricing moderate a little bit as demand starts to moderate some. So I don't expect the volatility, if you will, to be quite as large on the new lease side.On the renewal side, we talked about it from the beginning of the year, there was a sort of unusual scenario last year where for the first, call it, 7, 8 months of 2022, new lease pricing outpaced renewal pricing quite a bit. So we knew we had some opportunity kind of mark-to-market those that were on the renewal rates as the first part of last year. So we've kind of reached a point where we're lapping those and starting to reprice those. That's where you've seen the renewal pricing moderate a little bit, but we still expect it to be quite a bit stronger than new lease rates, which is typical and really just kind of returning to a normal seasonality scenario.OperatorAnd we will go next to Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.James Colin FeldmanGreat. I appreciate your comments on mid-tier markets outperforming the entire portfolio. Can you talk more about A versus B and how those are performing within your market?Timothy P. ArgoYes. This is Tim. It's -- the Bs are still outperforming a little bit. I would call it kind of a 40 to 50 basis point gap between what -- how we would define As versus Bs, and that's pretty consistent on the new lease side and the renewal side. So I think it's part of the portfolio structure that we expect those markets that can be more of the B assets perform well and some of the supply or in most markets, the supply coming in, hasn't been quite as impactful on some of the more B assets. They've typically been much higher price, more urban-style assets and at a much higher rent than particularly some of the B assets.James Colin FeldmanOkay. And then in the press release, you talked about demand kind of maybe even better than your initial expectations and mitigating some of the supply risks. Can you give more color or maybe put some numbers around that? Maybe I don't know if you've looked in that detail, but like what percentage of (inaudible) do you need to mitigate that supply risk? Just more color on what gives you confidence in making that statement and what you're seeing.Timothy P. ArgoYes. So there's a few things that we typically look at as a leading indicator of demand. You obviously have job growth at a macro level, which continues to be pretty strong and certainly stronger in a lot of the Sunbelt markets and then more granular, we look at exposure, lead volume, what we call lead per exposed unit, which is really a combination of those 2 metrics and then also looking at what our renewal accept rates are.So on lead volume and leads per exposed, it's not at the level it was in '22, which was record demand. But as I noted in the comments, you go back to kind of the 2018, 2019 time frame when we saw more normal, if you will, demand scenario, we have -- our lead volume leads per exposed is quite a bit higher than those times. So that's encouraging that our renewal accept rates remained strong and higher to that period as well. We have 60% accept rate for July, 58% for August and 43% for September, which is at or above where we would expect or we would like to see it.And then a couple of other metrics, rent-to-income continues to stay consistent, stay low, actually dropped a little bit from what it was in Q1, turnover remains low and reasons people moving out to buy house is way down. So all of those various factors, while not quite at the level we've seen with the record performance last year, still healthy and stronger than typical year, if you will.H. Eric BoltonAnd Jamie, this is Eric. I'll add to what Tim just said, which covers a lot of reasons why we see the demand staying healthy. The other thing it's just a continued positive migration trends, 13% of the leases that we wrote in Q2 were for people moving into the Sunbelt for the first time. And that compares to 15%, 16% during the peak of COVID. So while it's moderated, it's moderated just a little bit, and it's still well above where it was before COVID started. So these positive migration trends are still there. Any thought of some kind of reversal after COVID was over. I think we've dispelled that fear at this point. So there's just a multitude of factors that sort of go into it, and we're pleased with where we see demand continuing to hold up.James Colin FeldmanOkay. That's very helpful color. And then final for me, your comments about expenses moderating into the back half of the year, certainly encouraging. As you think about '24 and the key line items, do you have a sense like do you think all of them will be down in terms of your expense growth rate?Albert M. CampbellI think as you talk about, I mean, too early to really get to refined on '24, but certainly, we would expect some continued moderation, just some of the inflationary pressures begin to weighing. The 3 main areas, obviously, the personnel, repair, maintenance and taxes. Taxes, I would say, being the biggest, certainly it's going to follow the moderations of the top line. So it's a backward-looking thing. So you would naturally think that as '24 looking back to '23, which is a good year, but a more moderate year than it was in '22 that you should see some moderation there. So probably in those 3 that make up 70% of our expenses, you'll see some moderation at some level.James Colin FeldmanIs it -- can you ballpark it?Albert M. CampbellHard to ballpark at this point. I don't think it would be probably a long-term rate, but somewhere between we are today and that.OperatorAnd we will move then to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Austin Todd WurschmidtI'm just curious if you're finding that you're having to trade off some of that new lease growth to drive traffic or sustain occupancy in the 95.5% level. It seemed like July occupancy dipped from the [retracting]. And I'm just wondering kind of think through as sort of seasonal demands lows and supply picks up, does that concern as you move to the latter part of the year and heading into '24?Timothy P. ArgoHey Austin, this is Tim. On the occupancy front, we've kind of -- we've been hanging in that 95.5% range for really all of the first half of the year, which we've been comfortable with, as we mentioned, with pricing being a little bit better than we thought. So we're willing to make that trade-off with the compounding growth we can get from rents. As we moved into July, I can see it moderated a little bit.There is some unique circumstances in Atlanta that we can talk about that's driving that down a little bit, if you kind of pull Atlanta out of that number, we'd be right back to 95.5% on occupancy, which we're comfortable being in that range. So it hasn't -- it hasn't moved the needle. I don't think in a new lease rate a little bit. I mean there is some supply pressure that we've talked about. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything specifically tied to occupancy necessarily.H. Eric BoltonAnd Austin, I'll also add a couple of points on that. The -- the thing to keep in mind is we have a pretty extensive sort of redevelopment and some of the new technology initiatives that we're particularly Smart Home initiative, that continues to fuel the opportunity for positioning the portfolio at a higher rent level, particularly as it compares to some of the new supply coming into the market. One of the benefits of the supply coming to the market, particularly when it's coming into the market on average 20% higher than the rents that we're charging, it creates a more compelling value play for our portfolio to the rental market.And so that's working to give us some momentum on the rent growth that we might otherwise not have both of those things. And then -- the -- so I would just tell you -- and the other thing that I would tell you is we track pretty actively why people leave us. And when you look at move-outs that are occurring because people don't want to pay the rent increase, has ticked down a little bit from where it was last year as a percent of our turnover, but it's still running higher than it has long term.And as Tim says, we're okay with that trade-off for a slightly lower occupancy right now because that revenue growth associated with rents is really much more impactful in terms of compounding value over the long term. So we sort of like where we are right now and continue with this sort of trying to manage that tension between pricing and occupancy where it is right now.Austin Todd WurschmidtGot it. No, that's helpful. It sounds like that (inaudible) occupancy and maybe even some of the frictional vacancy is like redevelopment was picking up a little bit from where you had originally expected. Second question, when you look across some of your larger markets, obviously, new lease growth is modestly positive. But when you kind of look across the large markets where you're feeling some of the supply pressure more acutely, are there any that are notable gain to lease today that you'd kind of highlight that we should be a little bit more focused on moving forward?Timothy P. ArgoAustin, it's Tim. When you say Gain to lease, meaning where there's...Austin Todd Wurschmidt(inaudible) are noticeably above market rents. Yes.Timothy P. ArgoNot -- I wouldn't say anything significant. Even -- we do have some negative new lease rates on a couple of those larger markets, but none of them are getting to out about, I mean they're kind of in that negative 1% type range. So it's not a huge, huge variance in what we're seeing overall. So nothing significant that I would point out.Austin Todd WurschmidtWhich are those that are at that kind of negative 1%-ish range?Timothy P. ArgoSo you've got -- I would point out Austin is one that's been a little softer, Austin and Phoenix, and we've talked about those 2 markets here for a while are kind of the two that I would point out that have been our weaker performers and certainly have some supply impact. So great about the long term, obviously, we have great demand fundamentals, but those have been 2 that probably lead the list in terms of our higher concentration markets.OperatorWe will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.Bradley Barrett HeffernFor some of the markets that are lagging their normal seasonal trends, like you obviously just mentioned Austin and Phoenix but some of the other ones as well. Do you think that that's entirely due to elevated supply? Or are there any other factors that you would call out that might be driving that?Timothy P. ArgoNo, I think it's primarily supply. I mean, supply is somewhat widespread across several of the larger markets in particular. And then it's nuanced to by market, obviously, and depending on where our portfolio is relative to some others. I mean, Charlotte is a good example. It's getting high level of supply, similar to some of these other markets, but it's performed well, and it's just kind of where our portfolio is positioned versus where the supply is coming in.So generally, I'd say supply, again, going back to the demand side. If you look at job growth across our markets compared to national averages, we're pretty consistently higher than average across all those markets. So there's obviously nuances by market but nothing notable outside of that.Bradley Barrett HeffernOkay. Got it. And then on the balance sheet, obviously, you've been setting record low leverage numbers every quarter for a while now. What do you think the likelihood is that we'll see these [sub-4x] numbers stick around for the long term? Or I guess, what are the circumstances where you would potentially take leverage back up to a more normal level?Albert M. CampbellSo Brad, this is Al. And we've talked about for, I think, several quarters now. Certainly, we love the strength of our balance sheet, but our leverage is really below where we want it long term at this point. We've been patient to allow opportunities come to us. So in our credit rating at [A- to 4.5] would be something you could be very confident, so we're a full turn below that right now. So significant opportunity there, but willing to be patient to allow Brad to find the right investments.H. Eric BoltonAnd we do think that as we get later in this year and particularly into 2024, that we are seeing early indications that would suggest that opportunities are going to start to pick up. As Brad alluded to, we have seen cap rates moved just a tad on a sequential basis quarter-to-quarter. And we're talking -- he and his team are talking to another -- a number of merchant builders right now about some opportunities. So we continue to feel confident and comfortable that more opportunity is around the corner.OperatorAnd we will move next to Michael Goldsmith with UBS.Michael GoldsmithIn response to an earlier question in the Q&amp;A, you talked about new lease not accelerating as much as you expected. Does that mean that new leases have the rent growth has peaked earlier in the season than it had in the past? And then the second part of that question talked about you don't expect it to decelerate as quickly, why is that?Timothy P. ArgoWell, one nuance there. The new lease pricing has done what we expected. It didn't decelerate or it didn't accelerate less than we expected. It accelerated a little bit less than what we've seen in the last couple of years, but in line with, if not slightly better than expectations. And so what we've seen is new lease pricing accelerate, just not quite as much as it may do in a lower supplied environment. So I think at the same time, given all the fundamentals we're seeing and the various metrics we talked about earlier, don't quite expect that new lease rate to drop off quite as much as it might normally for kind of the same reason it did accelerate as much. So that's kind of how we see it playing out. But really been as if not better than expected.Michael GoldsmithAnd then as a follow-up, there's a lot of new supply coming in your markets, tenants or potential tenants have a lot of options to choose from. Are you seeing a longer time for tenants to make a decision? Or maybe like between your traffic to visit and the time between that and when they sign our conversion rates being low. What are you seeing in the trends there? What are you seeing in the trends from that perspective?Timothy P. ArgoNot really anything, Mike. It's probably taken a little bit longer for us to get an answer on the renewal side, but ultimately, as I mentioned, our renewal accept rates are better than they were a couple of years ago in a similar environment and kind of where we expect to see them. Our conversion rates are in line with that period as well. So nothing notable other than -- I mentioned the leads are down a little bit from what we saw last year, but we would have expected that with the growth we saw last year.OperatorAnd we will go next to Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbSo just trying to put a bow on the supply. It's obviously been a big topic. If I hear correctly from what you're saying, it sounds like it's really only Phoenix and Austin where it's really an issue. Atlanta has maybe as another market, just given the occupancy dip that you talked about. But otherwise, the balance of your portfolio, it sounds like yes, there's supply, but it's not really competitive with you guys. You feel comfortable with the in-migration, the economic growth, the job growth to be comfortable with your rents. So is that sort of the main takeaway that the supply is really limited to maybe 2 or 3 markets for you guys, and that's it. All the other markets are fine. I just sort of want to encapsulate this.Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean also an advantage of the 2 that are the worst. I mean I wouldn't say we only have 2 or 3 that are feeling any supply impacts. I mean I think it is impacting several of our markets at some level. But what we've always talked about is with the demand being there, supply just sort of moderate things. It doesn't put it in a ditch. It is shocks on the demand side that really send rate growth negative for extended period of time, and we're not seeing that. So I mean I -- like I said, I wouldn't say there's only 2 we're feeling some supply pressure, but those are the most notable. But otherwise, demand is doing a pretty good job of mitigating things.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. And then the second question is your guidance for the second quarter is rather wide. And I'm assuming you guys are pretty conservative group, but $2.18 on the low side, just low obviously. So should we expect a decline quarter-to-quarter? Or are there some oddball things that could come up that would drive like I'm just trying to think why would FFO go down? And maybe you'll say, hey, it's a onetime item. There's some sort of tax impact or returns or something like that, that we're going to see?Albert M. CampbellAlex, this is AL. I think, you see in the second and third quarter often, some things that are below same-store NOI, whether it be overhead, whether it be -- so just some items that are more -- that are not in your operating costs. And so second and third quarter, they tend to be chunky. What we're seeing is some of those costs we talked about that we outperformed in the second quarter on G&amp;A. But that would be timing lag, some of that's going to come back to us seeing some of that in the third quarter, which (inaudible) that a little bit. So nothing unusual. You see that second and third quarter be a little volatile, but the important point is just the projection for the year, continued strength.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoTim, just going back to Atlanta. I know last quarter, you talked about some weather issues affecting occupancy. Was there anything else driving the occupancy being lower there this quarter?Timothy P. ArgoYes. A couple of things going there. I mean Atlanta is experiencing a decent amount of supply. It's not quite as high as some of our other markets, but relative to what Atlanta typically gets there. There is some supply pressure. But a couple of other things impacting that. You mentioned one of them. We had sort of late first quarter, early second quarter over the course of 2 or 3 months. We had about 100 units come back online in Atlanta, which was a mixture of some units that were down to storm damage and then a fire at one of our properties. And so pulling those back into the portfolio and mean to lease those up had some impacts.And then secondly, which is -- hinders us a little bit in the short term, but is positive on the long term is Atlanta and the counties there have started to progress some on evictions and filings and doing court dates and kind of working through that whole process, which has been a real laggard in terms of our markets for working through that. So we actually, year-to-date have seen about 140 more evicts and skips this time versus the same period last year.So a good thing, as I said, long term, and we are seeing a little bit better payment progress there, but it kind of doubled down on some of the occupancy pressure there. Revenue and pricing has held in okay. It's a little bit below the market, but not -- are a little bit below the portfolio but not too bad. And overall, we obviously still feel good about it long term, but just running through a little bit of pressure right now.Nicholas Philip YulicoOkay. And then in terms of -- if we think about new supply and concessions being offered across markets. Can you just give a feel for where concessions are more prevalent, competing product and where you're also offering concessions in the existing assets or in any of the development assets?Timothy P. ArgoYes. So for our portfolio, concessions are running about -- cash concessions are about 0.5% of rents. It's ticked up a little bit, but not significantly. I mean we do tend to net price with our pricing system, so, don't use a ton of concessions. But broadly, at a market level and what we're seeing some of the competitors. I would say you're at a month free is about where we're at in several of the larger markets. And for most, that is more kind of in-town central areas of the markets, you might see a little bit more if there's a lease up in the area, but we're not seeing any more than a month and a half or so in any of our markets.Austin is one where it's a little unique in that, we're actually not seeing a lot of concessions kind of in the Central Austin but more in the suburbs where there's quite a bit of supply. That's one where concessions are a little more prevalent in the suburbs versus other markets where it's more urban In-fill.Adrian Bradley HillSorry, I just want to add to that real quick. You asked about our lease-up properties. To Tim's point, we've got 1 in lease-up in Austin. That one, we're offering up to a month free, which is on select units, by the way, not across the board. We've got a couple of hundred units competing supply just in that same submarket. So I'd say that one is probably feeling the most pressure. But I will say that average rents on that property are a couple $300 to $400 higher than what we expected. And then the average concession usage there is significantly below what we expected.Most of our new lease-ups, we expect about a month free, and we've been significantly below that on this asset. And then I would just say, all of our properties that are in lease-up right now, we're below what we generally proforma, which is a month free, just we're offering that on select units as needed. So it's not broad-based use of concessions that we're seeing right now.Nicholas Philip YulicoGreat. If I could just follow up on the investment activity and being more patient there. I know you gave some commentary on this. But is that more of a view that, hey, cap rates seem like they're too low to where you're penciling they should make sense? Or is it also just a view that, hey, at some point, we're not sure exactly where market rents are going in some areas, there is supply coming. Maybe there's an opportunity to wait. You mentioned talking to merchant developers and just trying to kind of tie together, I guess, valuation versus a view on, hey, fundamentals are becoming a little bit uncertain because of supply.Adrian Bradley HillRight. Nick, this is Brad. I would say it's really the belief that we think cap rates will tick up a bit from where they are right now. I mean the fundamentals generally are holding up pretty well within our region of the country, and we're not seeing distress certainly in our region and especially in these lease-up properties. We've seen cap rates tick up over the last year, 1.5 years and really what we believe right now with the limited amount of inventory that's on the market, the capital that's out there kind of piling up on each other on the assets that are coming to market. So that is driving down cap rates.We also continue to see a high proportion of the deals that do trade or 1031 exchange as well as loan assumptions. So we just believe that as the elevated supply that's occurred in our market over the last year, 2 years, begins to come to market. Those assets need to trade, merchant developers need to sell and as that product comes to market, it's likely to spread out the capital a bit and we're likely to see cap rates continue to move up a bit from where they are today.Today, interest rates are 5.5%, 5.75%. And I think when you layer on to that, just still good operating fundamentals, but not the 5%, 6%, 7% rent growth that we've seen over the last year. I do think that, that continues to point to a scenario where the negative leverage continues to decrease, which supports increasing cap rates. So just for context, after the [GFC], 3-year period after that, we purchased 9,000 units over a 3-year period. And I don't know if this situation will be as fruitful as that was for us, but it certainly feels like our region is really primarily driven by merchant developers and product needs to trade at some point, and we're starting to see cap rates move up a bit. So we're going to be patient and hold our capacity to what we think will be a better opportunity.OperatorAnd we will move next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimI wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance. You narrowed the range, but you maintained the midpoint. But you started the year with 5.5% earn-in. So just to hit the top end of your same-store revenue guidance of 7%. You only really needed to achieve 3% lease growth rates for the year. You've already exceeded that. I think you've been saying that lease growth rates have come in higher than expected. So I know that occupancy offsets this a little bit, same with the fees, but your 6.25% midpoint seems very conservative today. I just wanted your response on this.Albert M. CampbellJohn, this is AL. I think the important point there, we didn't cover today, we've talked about it a bit in the past is that there is a little bit of dilution in that total revenue from the pricing line because there's other income components that are what, about 10% of our revenue stream that aren't growing, if they call it 7%. And so they're growing 2% to 3%. And so that dilutes it some. So that's probably the difference there. But in general, the math that you laid out with the 5.5% carry in plus half of the pricing performance we've gotten this year, which is we've talked about was 3% -- 3.5% blended pricing, half of that. That gives you pretty close to the effective rent growth expectation we have this year and then those other income items dilute that just a bit.John P. KimSo is there a likelihood that you're going to achieve above the midpoint of your guidance?Albert M. CampbellI'm just saying that the guidance is -- we think the guidance is accurate. There are things other than effective rents that are affecting that total revenue, John. There's items that are other income related that are growing call it, 2% to 3% that bring that down. So if you're looking at total revenue, I think the -- we brought it in just because we narrowed it, which we typically do, just because we have a little more information getting closer to the end of the year, but that midpoint of 6.25% in total revenue, we still feel that's the right number.John P. KimOkay. My second question is on the insurance premium that you got at 20%. I know that's in line with your guidance, but it still came in probably lower than many of us had expected. And I'm wondering if there was any change in the coverage that you had to get that premium, whether it's self-insuring or reduced coverage or anything else?Robert J. DelPrioreYes, John, this is Rob. Yes, in part, the cost -- the property insurance premium is a big driver of it. It was up about 33%, and that was offset by a much smaller increase in our casualty lines, automobile workers' comp, general liability. So the balance well as you said, was about 20%. We did have some changes on the retentions this year, about $1 million on our per occurrence and a couple of million dollars on our aggregate then we do have a separate freeze event deductible because of some of the events that were happening in the Southeast.But overall, we feel like the retentions that we have are appropriate given the balance sheet strength we have and the spread of risk across the portfolio, given the geographic disbursement. And then as we've done for several years, we did take a portion of the primary insurance that we've got about $10 million of self-retention there that we feel very comfortable with, with an insurance product that caps our loss over 3 years at $15million or so, I feel like we're in really good shape there relative to the strength of the balance sheet.OperatorAnd we will move next to John Pawlowski with Green Street.John Joseph PawlowskiBrad or Eric, I just had a follow-up question regarding the glimpses and signs of better acquisition opportunities you're starting to see. Can you just give me a sense for whether you're seeing notable signs and broad-based sign of capitulation on pricing from merchant builders struggling with higher debt service costs on their lease ups?Adrian Bradley HillYes, John, this is Brad. Yes, I would say we're not seeing capitulation at this point. I think what we're seeing is selectively developers are looking to take some risk off the table on select assets when it makes sense for them to do so. I mean just for context in the first quarter, we track, I think, 7 deals that we had data points on. We're up to, call it, 14 in the second quarter. But I would also say the majority of those are not necessarily merchant developed assets. So again, not a lot of data points there. We've seen a few but not broad-based. I do think that, that is what we continue to monitor because as we get later into this year, to my comments earlier, I think the merchant developer profile and need to transact increases. But we haven't seen that really open up broadly at the moment.H. Eric BoltonAnd John, I would tell you, as you get later in the year and you get into the slower leasing season sort of during the holidays and Q1 of next year, a lot of these lease-ups are going to see more pressure. Just leasing traffic is not as robust during that time of the year. And so we do think that we're heading into an environment where more likely than not, pressure will build for some of the lease-up projects that are happening out there, and that may trigger some opportunity.John Joseph PawlowskiOkay. Makes sense. Final question for me. Tim, you talked about the mid-tier markets outperforming over coming quarters. Could you just give us a sense a rough range of the blended rent spreads you expect in your mid-tier markets over the second half of this year versus the more supply lead in larger metros?Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean, it obviously varies by market. There are some doing much better than others. But I would say and depending on what -- which market you divide in mid-tier versus not, you're probably somewhere in 100 to 150 basis point blended spread. So year-to-date, we're seeing several that are in that 4.5% to 5% range compared to our upper 3s overall portfolio. So I do think 100 to 200 basis points spread is probably about right.OperatorAnd we will move next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.Robert Chapman StevensonI know you have quite a lot of data on your residents. Do you have the data on the percentage of residents with student loans outstanding? And what do you think the resumption of payments is going to have impact wise on ability to pass-through future rent increases in '24?Timothy P. ArgoYes, Rob, this is Tim. We talked about that a little bit. We do not have insight into that. We outsource sort of our credit check and income verification. So we don't have insight into that, certainly at any broad level and actually as part of income qualification and rent-to-income checks, you're not allowed to use student debt as part of that. So really don't have much insight into that, to be honest.Robert Chapman StevensonOkay. And then, AL, how are you reading Texas in terms of this property taxes going forward? Is this just a onetime distribution of the surplus? Or are you expecting to see fundamental changes there and lower levels of property taxes in Texas going forward?Albert M. CampbellNo, Rob, we would read this at some level, it should be an ongoing benefit. I mean every -- what we've seen over the last several years is Texas because of the strength of the state has had really high valuations come out, property valuations. And we've seen millage rate rollbacks some more than others in different municipalities because of that because there is some limitation at the revenue level and budgetary level on taxes they can do.So we had projected a rate rollback. Now this because the overall budget surplus goes well beyond that. And so they basically recognizing that the [coppers] are full, recognizing that the state is doing very well, that valuations overall are very strong. So they're permanently reducing that rate, if you would, by legislation. Now the other side of that is in the future, if the economy in Texas is different, they could undo it. But this should be a permanent ongoing impact that's pretty significant. I mean it caps out to be something like $0.20 per $100 of value for your property values, and that's pretty significant.Robert Chapman StevensonAnd any other markets where you're seeing property taxes trending above or below your expectations from earlier this year?Albert M. CampbellNot really. I think the one outstanding to really get the final information on other than Texas is Florida. It's the one that comes in late. And so we need to see the millage rates there. We've got the values. We need to see the millage rates coming in like a pretty significant. But other than that, getting a pretty clear picture at this point. We're about 70% of the knowledge at this point, I would say, Rob.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.Anthony Franklin PowellJust wanted to walk through maybe the medium-term outlook for lease spreads. It sounds like you expect new lease spreads to be in the 0% to 1% range for the next couple of quarters. Is that renewals go to 0% to 1% maybe early next year as well? Or kind of remain above new for a while?Timothy P. ArgoYes. I think I would expect renewals to remain above new, and that's not unusual. I mean, what we saw last year where new lease rates were quite a bit higher than renewals is more the exception than the norm. And so with renewals, you've got obviously, somebody that has lived with you and hopefully you provided good resident service and have an asset that they enjoy living in, and so there's some friction costs to move and all that. So typically, we would see renewals pretty consistently above new leases. So I don't expect it to get down to the new lease level.Anthony Franklin PowellGot it. And can you remind us what's your peak level of supply delivery on a quarterly basis? Is it first half of next year? And just when do you think supply starts to come down in your market?Timothy P. ArgoYes. I mean it's difficult to nail down to a quarter, but I think our belief right now is kind of peaking early 2024 and then starting to trend down and then really set up for a good position as we get into 2025 in terms of lower deliveries.OperatorWe have no further questions. I'll hand the call to MAA for closing remarks.H. Eric BoltonWe appreciate everyone joining us this morning and obviously follow up with any other questions that you may have. And that's all we have this morning. So thank you for joining us.OperatorThis concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.6%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 33.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.36. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. TE Connectivity has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 14% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for TE Connectivity's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.TE Connectivity Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's earnings release, global demand for Northrop Grumman Solutions is driving exceptional growth. In the second quarter, our sales were up 9% with solid contributions from each of our 4 business segments. Our ability to hire and retain talent and improving supplier deliveries are strengthening our top line. Given our year-to-date sales increase of 7% and an improved outlook, we're increasing our full year sales guidance range by $400 million. In addition, award volume in the quarter was robust, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14. As a result, we're increasing our full year book-to-bill projection to approximately 1.0. Our $79 billion backlog continues to be more than 2x our expected 2023 sales supporting our long-term growth outlook. We delivered solid second quarter earnings per share of $5.34, and we're increasing the lower end of our full year guidance range by $0.20. And free cash flow was healthy in the quarter, more than $1 billion higher than Q2 of last year, positioning us well for our full year target. Turning to the budget environment and starting with the U.S. We're encouraged by the continued bipartisan support for national security funding to implement the administration's National Defense strategy. The FY '24 budget and recent congressional committee bills prioritize modernization, including areas of strength in our portfolio such as the Triad, the Space domain, information superiority and advanced weapons. We also anticipate continued support for Ukraine and related emergency spending, which would represent even further increased demand. Global demand for our products also continues to grow as our allies increased defense spending to address evolving threats. We are well positioned in multiple markets to meet this demand with programs such as AARGM, IBCS and E-2D as well as munitions. With a robust backlog and continued growth outlook, I'd like to now spend a few minutes outlining our path to margin expansion, which is a key element of our earnings and cash flow growth plans. Our 2023 operating margin dollar guidance is in the range we've previously provided. This guidance implies a segment margin rate in the mid-11% range in the second half of 2023, having delivered a rate of 10.9% in the first half. We also see an opportunity to increase our year-over-year margin rate in 2024 and get to a 12% target in the longer term. Achieving this margin improvement is built on 3 key drivers: First is the stabilization of temporal macroeconomic factors that have driven higher cost and impacted our supply chain and labor efficiency. Second is the ongoing implementation of cost management programs across the company that help drive affordability, competitiveness and performance. And third is our business mix, which we see shifting to more international and production contracts as international demand grows and many of our current development programs mature over the next several years. With regard to the macroeconomic factors, supply chain disruptions rooted in the pandemic and the subsequent labor market tightness have created program delays and cost growth. To reduce this disruption, we're buying ahead of schedule, pursuing second sources where it makes sense and placing more of our people as suppliers to facilitate timely material deliveries. We see signs of progress across our supply chain from these actions, and we are seeing fewer new issues emerge. We've had exceptional performance in growing our head count since the second half of 2022 and attrition rates are down to pre-pandemic levels. Our focus now is on optimizing labor efficiency, which is an important driver of profitability. To accelerate the learning curve for our employees, we're leaning forward with innovative training programs and standardizing work instructions. Inflation has been a challenge for our industry as well as others. Cost growth has now begun to moderate, but the last 18 months of inflation continued to have a higher base effect on our costs, especially in labor. If you look at our year-end 2021 fixed-price backlog, it was largely priced before we began to experience elevated levels of inflation. However, of that backlog, approximately 70% will have been converted into sales by the end of this year. And for new bids, we are factoring higher inflation expectations into our contracts. We're also working to drive additional discipline in our bid approaches, particularly on fixed price contracts to help protect against these types of dynamics in the future. Overall, we anticipate that these macroeconomic impacts have stabilized and now have largely been incorporated into our margins or risk factors. The second key driver of margin opportunity is cost management, which benefits both affordability and competitiveness. We are laser focused on overhead cost reduction. A foundational element of these reductions is our implementation of digital solutions across our business, which will help to drive performance and productivity. For example, we've built a digital ecosystem that focuses on program execution, bringing together employees, customers and partners into an integrated environment so they can seamlessly work together. This accelerates design, integration, testing and deployment across programs, helping us to deliver with quality, speed and efficiency. We're increasing the number of programs that are operating in this ecosystem. And today, we have over 100 active programs that are doing so. We're also investing in and advancing the technologies and digital systems in our factories. We're scaling this across the enterprise to drive efficiencies that should benefit all of our stakeholders. For example, on the B-21, we've successfully demonstrated the use of this digital thread tied to advanced manufacturing technologies to realize over 15% labor efficiencies in 1 area of the build. And in June, we launched the expansion of this approach across the whole build process. We're extending this digital thread into our business operations to deliver further benefits across the company. This includes how we're managing our supply chain, where we've broadly centralized procurement and we're working to leverage our purchasing power to reduce costs. We have over 20,000 suppliers, and we've begun securely connecting them into our digital ecosystem. Over the next several years, we expect to have the majority of our supply base fully integrated. This is expected to lower supplier costs and significantly improve productivity. The third key area of margin opportunity is our business mix. For several years, we've had one of the highest cost plus development contract mixes in the industry, reflecting our significant early-stage position on key franchise programs, which will transition to production throughout this decade. This cost plus mix has been increasing, with our first half revenue at 55% cost plus, up from about 50-50 last year. Looking forward, we see this shifting towards more fixed price revenue, rising to approximately 60% of sales by 2027 as a number of large programs in all 4 of our sectors transition to production. Production program margins are typically a few points higher than development margins. So mix shift can contribute meaningfully to our segment operating margin rate. And we are making good progress on moving programs through development and into production. For example, AARGM-ER completed its fifth consecutive test flight in the second quarter. This program is nearing completion of its development phase and is on track to ramp production volumes next year. And on B-21, we successfully powered on the first flight test aircraft in the quarter, another important milestone in our campaign to achieve first flight and transition to production. We also expect our international business to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years. Improving margin opportunity as global sales become a larger percentage of our mix. In the second quarter, we demonstrated our IBCS solution for 8 potential international customers, reflecting growing demand for this advanced air and missile defense capability. We also signed a memorandum of agreement with Rheinmetall to expand capacity for F-35 center fuselage production in Europe. We expect these 3 drivers to result in improved affordability, even better performance and higher margins. When combined with the strength of our backlog and increasing global demand, these operating margin improvements should provide the foundation for strong future free cash flow growth. Now with respect to capital deployment, we're executing a strategy that prioritizes investments to support our business plans and return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year by 8%. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders and are on track to meet our goal of returning more than 100% of free cash flow this year. Overall, the global defense budget outlook and our alignment with customer priorities give us confidence in our growth trajectory. We are focused on margin expansion opportunities and converting this to free cash flow growth to deliver value both for our customers and our shareholders. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave, and he'll cover details of the second quarter financial results and updates to our full year outlook.David F. KefferThanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter. We remain focused on executing our strategy and believe we're well positioned to grow our top line, earnings and cash flows for years to come. The demand environment continues to be robust, supported by the alignment of our portfolio with our customers' highest priority missions. And as Kathy described, we see a path to expand margins in the second half of this year and beyond as macro pressures ease and we drive efficiencies into our business as it grows and experiences mixed tailwinds. Now turning to Q2 results. we generated $10.9 billion of new awards, a higher total than we previously expected. Our book-to-bill was 1.14 and was driven by restricted awards of $5.4 billion. This brings our year-to-date total to $8.6 billion in restricted bookings. Looking forward, we expect a number of production awards in the second half of the year, including the first lot of B-21 LRIP. Moving to sales on Slide 4 in our earnings deck. We delivered strong top line growth of 9% in the second quarter, building on the momentum from Q1, as a result of our success in bringing on new employees, incremental improvements in the supply chain and continued backlog strength, our sales are growing at a higher rate, and we've increased our full year guidance. With respect to segment results, all 4 of our businesses grew in the second quarter. Space continues to lead the way with their second consecutive quarter of 17% sales growth as GBSD, NGI and restricted space programs continue to ramp. And Defense Systems sales increased 10% on the strength of their armaments and missile defense franchises. Mission Systems growth of 5% was driven by restricted programs in the Network Information Solutions business, and Aeronautics Systems returned to growth as higher volume on restricted programs outpaced the headwinds on legacy programs as we've anticipated. Turning to Slide 5. Segment margins in the second quarter were 11%. Keep in mind that Q2 of last year included over $70 million or 80 basis points of benefit from a land sale and a contract related legal matter. Most importantly, margin dollars improved incrementally from Q1, largely meeting our expectations. Program performance remains strong across the portfolio, as the team does a good job in navigating the lingering disruption from the pandemic and macroeconomic factors we've been discussing. One area of pressure we experienced in the quarter was a $36 million unfavorable adjustment on NASA's Habitation and Logistics Outpost program, or HALO, in our Space Systems sector. Moving to earnings per share on Slide 6. Diluted EPS in the second quarter were $5.34. This included lower net pension income of roughly $1 per share, partially offset by more favorable returns on marketable securities than in the same period last year. Slide 7 highlights the nonoperational pension headwinds we experienced in Q2. On a year-over-year basis, 2023 pension income will be lower for all periods when compared to 2022, but these headwinds are expected to dissipate as we look to 2024. With respect to cash, we generated strong free cash flow in the second quarter of over $600 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, in which we had an outflow of $460 million. This improvement was driven by increased billings and timing of collections across the company. We paid roughly $360 million of cash taxes associated with Section 174, and we continue to expect a full year impact of a little over $700 million. Moving to 2023 guidance. I'll start with a few updates to our sector estimates, which you can see on Slide 8. Our Space business continues to deliver outstanding sales growth and bookings, demonstrating the strength of its diverse portfolio of capabilities. As a result, we're increasing sales guidance for Space to the high $13 billion range. Remember, as recently as 2019, this business was generating revenue in the mid-$7 billion range. So our guidance this year reflects a fantastic 4-year CAGR of roughly 17%. At Defense Systems, based on the strength of their year-to-date results, we're increasing our full year expectations for this business to the mid- to high $5 billion range. This represents growth in the low single-digit range. There are no changes to our revenue expectations at AS or MS. With respect to margin rates, we're maintaining our expectations for AS, DS and MS, and we're projecting a lower operating margin rate at Space to reflect the rapid increase in new program wins and their first half results. At the company level, this translates to an increase to our sales guidance of $400 million and a growth rate between 5% and 6% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for segment operating income dollars. We expect a slightly higher full year tax rate of 17%, and we've reduced our projection for shares outstanding to the mid 152 million to reflect our latest share repurchase expectations. Our EPS outlook continues to assume Q3 closure of the sale of the minority investment for which we increased our full year EPS guidance by $0.40 last quarter. This quarter, we're increasing the lower end of our guidance range by $0.20. We remain on track with our full year outlook for cash and continue to expect to grow our free cash flow to about $3 billion by 2025. This represents a greater than 20% CAGR, driven by the growth of our business and structural tailwinds from cash taxes, lower CapEx and higher CAS recoveries. And over the next 5 years, we see an opportunity to approximately double our current level of free cash flow. Lastly, we continue to execute our balanced capital deployment plan. This includes investments of over $2.8 billion in R&amp;D and CapEx this year and returning excess capital to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and share repurchase plans. For the year, we continue to expect to return over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders, including roughly $1.5 billion in share repurchases. We also plan to retire $1 billion of notes that mature in August, and we don't have any additional bond maturities until 2025. Overall, the Northrop Grumman team delivered a strong first half of the year. Our business strategy is working, and we're continuing to drive additional growth in sales, earnings and cash. With growing global demand for our portfolio of solutions and solid program performance, we're building long-term value for all our stakeholders. And with that, let's open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardA couple of questions from me. First of all, Kathy, thanks for your commentary on the margin expectations for the next few years. But I was wondering, as you talk about this, what are you expecting on the B-21 LRIP? Is that still anticipated to be around a sort of breakeven margin in your expectation? And then secondly, does the end of the F-18 have an impact on this?Kathy J. WardenRob, thanks for the question. So as we look at the profile going forward for B-21, as we've noted before, we are not planning to have margin from the LRIP contracts. So when I talk about our margin projections going forward, it anticipates that. I will remind you, we still have the risk factor associated with B-21 as we look at inflationary impacts. In the quarter, we did receive notification that the DoD has allocated $60 million for B-21 LRIP procurement due to inflationary impacts and we expect that to be awarded later this year. But keep in mind, this only applies to the one fiscal year it's associated with, FY '23, and we continue to work closely with the government on an effort to address the impacts of macroeconomic disruption.With regard to your question about F-18, yes, our projections also incorporate the line down of the F-18 production line. We've been anticipating that. It is built into our plans as we think about our production profile over time. That mix is being driven not just with Aerospace programs like B-21 transitioning into production and F-35 continuing to grow. It is built on our entire portfolio, all 4 of our segments will see program shifting from development to production in that time frame and that mix shifting.Robert Alan StallardOkay. Then just a quick follow-up on the HALO program. Could you clarify if this is a fixed price development program or if it has a different contractual structure?Kathy J. WardenIt is a fixed price program. We had worked with the government in a cost-plus structure through the preliminary design review. So we had a more mature design before transitioning into a fixed-price contract structure. And as I noted in my comments, we are being even more disciplined moving forward in ensuring that we work with the government to have the appropriate use of fixed-price contracts. We think that is best applied for commercial items or production programs with stable requirements and mature design, as it's turning out on the HALO program. The requirements are not as stable as we or the government anticipated, and we're working with them to address that change management as we go forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global Partners.Richard Tobie SafranSo you've been a bit reluctant to talk about this so far, but I thought I'd see if you'd comment on the NGAD sixth generation fighter program since the Air Force just recently announced the competition. What I'd like to know is if you're thinking about bidding this as a prime. And I'd also like to know if you could -- if this program is considered part of your growth strategy. So any color you could provide there would be helpful.Kathy J. WardenThanks, Rich. Yes, before the government officially announced the program and their intend to issue the RFP, we had been quiet, but we have notified the U.S. Air Force that we're not planning to respond to the NGAD RFP as a prime. We are responding to other bidders request for proposal as a supplier. That's particularly in our Mission Systems portfolio. And as I noted in my remarks, we are remaining disciplined in assessing the right programs to pursue, and that's one where we feel we're well positioned with a mature offering. And where the business deal reflects an appropriate balance of risk and reward for both the customer and the industrial base. So the [novice] decision on this program doesn't impact our path to sales and earnings growth at NGIS. We have a strong backlog in that sector, and we have other opportunities in military aircraft that we are pursuing.OperatorOur next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Ronald Jay EpsteinI guess I have to dig down a little bit further on that. Would that no bid also cross over to F/A-XX, or do you -- is that a related program or a different program? How should we think about that? Or is that when -- you'd want to be a supplier on as well?Kathy J. WardenWell, I'll just say that when I noted, we have other opportunities we are pursuing. I won't disclose at this point exactly what those are. So a little more information comes out on other programs but you could assume that if we feel we're well positioned and the government is appropriately balancing risk and reward, as I said, that would be a program we would pursue.OperatorOur next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagMaybe following back up on those 2 questions. I mean, not bidding as a prime at NGAD. Kathy, is this part of your strategy in terms of containing margin growth in the next few years? Because when you look at historically, you guys had walked away from T7. You'd walk away from the tanker and avoided the winner's curse. Is that how to think about the strategy for this program? Or are there other factors in play that we should consider?Kathy J. WardenWell, Kristine, certainly, your words not mine, but we do feel that discipline has served us well in the past in selecting how much risk to take and what to pursue. And we've learned lessons from some of our own experience as well. So we are applying those as we think about what to bid and what not to bid going forward. And that is critical to us expanding our margins back to what investors expect of this company. And it's the 3 factors I mentioned, but bid discipline and ensuring we have the right combination of risk and reward is important. And it's not just important for us to be able to meet our commitments to investors. But for the entire industrial base to remain healthy so that we can have industrial base that investors want to invest in.OperatorOur next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedOn the margin question, when we look at history, generally, inflation, it doesn't affect defense companies that much. And we've obviously seen a very difficult 2 years where it rose and you've talked about this rose very quickly and you've had to absorb costs and fixed price contracts. When you look forward, you talked about being able to run out some of the contracts that were priced before we had that higher inflation level. But when you look at repricing contracts that go into next tranches, new work, do you expect that you're going to be able to get back to be able to price off a base cost level that can allow you to have the same kind of performance we saw in the sense in the pre-COVID era?Kathy J. WardenYes, Doug, we do expect that to be the case. The government will look at the actuals that we have experienced and the inflationary pressures are absolutely showing up, not only in labor but materials, which then provide us the basis to work with the government and negotiate off of those higher costs in the future contract.Douglas Stuart HarnedAnd then clearly -- and it sounds like you're looking at this. So over the next 12 months or so, you should see this shift. But clearly, it also requires more money in the budget. We saw a lot of money coming in, in the '23 budget from the Senate last year, but you're expecting then the budget to also be able to cover these higher costs?Kathy J. WardenI expect that the budget will need to incorporate these higher costs to the extent that inflation exceeds the growth of the overall budget, there could, of course, be supplementals, or priorities will be made in terms of what the government will buy. And we're already seeing this where the government is having to reduce quantities on programs from their anticipated levels to address the higher cost coming in based on inflation, and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future as these contracts come up for renewal.OperatorOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluI want to ask about Space specifically, please. Your revised guidance takes into account $1.6 billion of sales growth in 2023. Can you maybe bucket this growth for us? Where is it coming from? How much of it is GBSD? And how do we think about the margin implications of this growth given the quarter?Kathy J. WardenSo a good bit of the growth has been and continues this year to come from 2 programs, GBSD and NGI. We have talked about that being approximately half of the growth. And the other half coming from a broad set of programs, but most notably, our national security portfolio, which is about 80% of our overall revenue in the Space business. And the margin profile is similar across those businesses, with early phase development being lower margin as we shift into production like we talked about earlier on the call, will present the opportunity for space margins to continue to expand. But we're really pleased with the 9% that we're seeing there. Obviously, we're going to work to get that closer to 10% through the work that we're doing, both on performance and in the longer term, as mix just seen and have the potential to go even higher. But when you look at 9% for a business that has absorbed that type of growth and been able to continue to manage through the disruption of the macroeconomic environment, we feel like we're in a good place.OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.Matthew Carl AkersI wanted to ask about Sentinel. I think there was a GAO report during the quarter that talked about maybe some scheduled risk on that program. I think it's cost-plus anyway, but just your thoughts on how that program is going, if there is maybe any risk to you guys on that.Kathy J. WardenYes. Thanks for the question. So this is in regards to Sentinel or GBSD, as many of you know it. And there was a GAO report that focus schedule pressure. We've been talking about that and the U.S. Air Force has as well as we have seen disruption in supply that has flow through to schedule pressure on the program. We're in the process of working with the Air Force on looking to optimize the schedule to see what we can pull left, what obviously is shifting right, and how we can maintain the initial operating capability, which is the primary focus of the government so that we can replace those missiles in the silos as anticipated later in the decade.Matthew Carl AkersOkay. And then if I could follow up, I guess, maybe on working capital, Dave, I don't know if you could just comment on your thoughts on how that progresses in the second half?David F. KefferSure. Thanks, Matt. We continue to feel really good about our working capital status as efficient, I think, as any across the industry, and particularly strong in the second quarter. We mentioned $1 billion of improvement year-over-year in free cash flow that was bolstered by the strength of our invoicing and collection efforts during the quarter, which puts us in good stead as we think about where we stand year-to-date compared to a year ago. We continue to expect typical seasonal pattern with the strongest free cash flow and therefore, working capital efficiency in the fourth quarter of the year. But overall, I feel good about our working capital efforts.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.Peter J. ArmentKathy, thanks for your comments on the mix and kind of the longer-term outlook on where that transitions from cost-plus to kind of fixed price mix for the company. Is 2023 kind of the peak year? Or is it more like next year for cost-plus? And then just, Dave, related to kind of just your comments on working capital, how do we think about the working capital profile kind of over that similar period? Is that like -- does that become a headwind? Or is it an opportunity for you?David F. KefferThank you, Peter. I'll start with your mix question. Yes, this is the year to think of as the high watermark for cost-type work given where we are in the development cycle, particularly on many of our largest programs. We mentioned we've been in the 55% of sales range in terms of the cost plus mix in the first half of the year. We expect that to ease slightly in the second half. But it's really over the next 4, 5 years, we'll see that shift back to the other side of 50-50 and toward that 60-40 fixed price mix that we described in our prepared remarks. So that is a meaningful opportunity for us in terms of margin expansion as we help deliver those capabilities to our customers in the production phases of the programs. Working capital longer term, as I mentioned, we're really pleased with our working capital efficiency when we think about where we finished 2022, where we project 2023 finishing as well. And so we don't think of working capital as a source of a lot of upside opportunity for additional efficiency over the next 5 years, nor do we think of it as an area of expected headwind. I think it will be more neutral than that. So when you think about what will drive that opportunity to double our current run rate of free cash flow over the next 5 years, think of it in terms of growth in the sales volume of the business, the margin rate opportunity we've been talking about and the conversion of those margin dollars to cash flow, that's certainly the #1 effort and the #1 driver. But then coincident with that, you'll see a decline in demand for capital expenditures. We're at peak levels in '23 and '24 around capital intensity. That will ease toward more historical levels over the next 5 years. You'll see some increase in CAS funding over the next couple of years in our -- in the projections we've outlined over the last few quarters. And then cash taxes will decline based on current tax law, particularly related to the amortization requirements for R&amp;D.OperatorOur next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroOn the options for the B-21, I mean you still got the same commentary in the Q. I think you've been expecting the first option to get called in the third quarter. Is that the time yet that we'd expect to see some real update on what the losses might be? And if -- would you sit there and just provide a number for that one option and then subsequently wait till other options are exercised? Or what's your thinking as to how you will handle that?David F. KefferGeorge, it's Dave. So as we talked about on the call, the first flight test aircraft successfully powered on in Q2. We remain on track for first flight this year. Again, that timing continues to depend on events and data, of course, over time. And we anticipate that, that first LRIP contract will be awarded following first flight. We will continue to evaluate the performance and the outlook for B-21 LRIP as well as the EMD portion of the program on a quarterly basis and provide updates as we have them. Of course, those will be formed by continued progress in driving efficiencies on the program as well as our understanding of that first LRIP contract lot and beyond. So we'll take all of that into account each quarter as we update our thinking.We can take that one follow-up. If you don't mind.George D. Shapiro(inaudible). So about half what you experienced in the first half, can you provide reasons for that slowing?David F. KefferSure. A few things I'd point out there. Obviously, the growth rate for the year for Space is increased with its guidance update to the low double digits now, and we're really pleased with that. The first half of the year has been closer to that 17% range. Some of what you see there is just a matter of the year-over-year compares where the first 2 quarters of the year were a bit lighter compares than Q4 in particular. And that's frankly the case across the business. We had a tremendous Q4 for sales volume in 2022. So we anticipate that the tough compare will lead to a lighter year-over-year growth rate in the second half of the year across all 4 of our segments as we get to Q4. But overall, the sequential growth is what we'll continue to look for from Space and other sectors. When you look across the company, you've got about 51% of our sales guidance in the second half, 49% in the first half. So you see the demonstration of continued sequential growth and the year-over-year growth rates are more of a matter of those compares.OperatorOur next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanI wanted to ask first about Space. And it seems like -- definitely appreciate the detailed commentary on the overall margin outlook. It seems like Space has been the business where a lot of that margin pressure has been felt most, not just maybe from foreseeable things like mix, but from surprises that have caused the company to guide down the margin there. What is about the portfolio in Space that's driving that now? And how do you assess the risk from here? Is Space still the sector where there's maybe the most margin risk due to continued work on fixed-price development programs like HALO and maybe exposure to the SDA tranches, which I think are also kind of fixed price development work. How do you see that now?Kathy J. WardenSo overall, the Space business is performing very well. We certainly have pockets in certain programs that we are focused on continuing to improve the discipline around how we're managing those efforts along with the customer. And so I don't see Space as materially different than any other segment of our business in terms of risk profile aside from mix. Certainly, there is more risk in development programs, and that's why we generally have lower margin rates coming out of development. But as Space has transitioned programs to later-stage development and production, their performance is as solid as the rest of the business, and we expect that to continue.Seth Michael SeifmanGreat. And maybe just as a quick follow-up in a perhaps futile attempt to bring out a little bit more information about the NGAD strategy. I believe the collaborative combat aircraft portion of NGAD is a separate solicitation. Are you planning to pursue that?Kathy J. WardenIt is a separate solicitation, and we're looking at it closely.OperatorOur next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonKathy, you mentioned margin expansion in '24, but obviously, the margins for '23 in the guidance has actually come down. So I'm just wondering -- could you put a quantum to the margin expansion you're looking for in '24? Is it to just get back to where prior '23 was? And then maybe for Dave, just a clarification. The 10-Q mentioned a $100 million gain in the third quarter. That isn't in your guidance. I wouldn't imagine just yet. Is that correct?Kathy J. WardenSo I'll start and then turn it to Dave. As I think about margin profile, we do expect the second half of this year to be stronger than the first half. And based on our guide, you could expect us to see that progress that we have largely from macroeconomic disruption dissipating through the year to continue into 2024. The mix shift that I spoke of is more gradual. I talked about that shift towards 60% fixed price in 2027. So you could think of that as a progression through 2024 to those later years. And so we're not going to guide today around 2024, we'll provide just some more specific as the year progresses and certainly at the beginning of the year, next year, but you could think of it as a steady progression of improvement, not a dramatic change from where we've been performing this year.David F. KefferAnd I could touch on the $100 million gain you referenced, that's just an approximation, of course, until that closes. We do expect that sale of an international minority investment to close in Q3. And that's the item for which we had increased our guidance range by $0.40 last quarter. So that is incorporated into our guidance net -- we see that in that $0.40 range of benefit to the company. So we're pleased to have that approaching and look forward to the cash inflow from it as well.OperatorOur next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussKathy, so your -- the growth rate accelerated a little bit faster in '23 than you had initially anticipated. As we think about '24 with AS returning to growth, and I assume Space growth slowing a little bit. Would you expect top line growth in a similar range? Or is it possible that we could still see an acceleration next year overall for the company as a whole?Kathy J. WardenRight. So we're really pleased with the progress that we've seen this year, our sales guidance increase in the Space and DS, and our other 2 sectors continuing to see progression toward their growth objectives as well. As we think about this year, a good portion of that growth is the strong backlog that we've developed and continued win of competitive bids. Part of it, too, though, is what we've been talking about with the phenomenon of having supplier deliveries delayed last year and starting to come in this year, having ramped our headcount significantly in the latter part of last year and early part of this year that's contributing to growth rate. Those elements you wouldn't think of as it continued. It was a bit of a bow wave that we've now seen come into this year. But the growth based on backlog performance and new wins, we do expect to continue into next year and expect to see another year of healthy growth in 2024.David F. KefferAnd the other point I'd add is, to your point, David, around the segment level view, we do expect the growth to be more balanced going forward with opportunities for growth in each of the 4 sectors as we demonstrated in this period in Q2. You see the growth in our Defense Systems business having recovered really nicely over the last couple of quarters. There are continued opportunities really across all 4 of the segments to drive growth.David Egon StraussGreat. Quick follow-up. On the F-18, how big is that still for you today? And when would you expect that to completely run off?David F. KefferSure. Consistent with the commentary from our prime on the program, we do anticipate that production will wind down over the next couple of years. And for us, that's 1% or less of sales and, therefore, not too dramatically impactful to the overall company top line. It's incorporated into our thinking about opportunities for growth in sales at AS over the next couple of years as are the other moving pieces we've talked about throughout the call today.OperatorOur next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citigroup.Jason Michael GurskyMy audio has been a little choppy this morning, so I apologize if you've already commented on this. But the comments you made early in your prepared remarks, Kathy, about the backlog that you had at the end of '21 and where you are going to sit as you exit this year with having delivered about 70% of that backlog. I'm just kind of curious, the remaining 30% is still in front of you. What -- how big is the B-21 program in the remainder of that 30% that you've got still deliver on?Kathy J. WardenSo the remainder of backlog on B-21 is relatively small because what's in backlog is the EMD program completion. Production has yet to be awarded. So there's a lot we've been talking about. We expect to get the first lot of production on contract later this year. But of course, it is priced. And so that is the contractual commitment, but we have not yet been awarded it, so it's not showing up in backlog. Programs that are a significant amount of that backlog are programs like Sentinel, a sizable program that was awarded in 2020 or 2021, and is going to carry forward for several more years as part of that EMD program in backlog. And there are several others, but none that rise to that level. But I will remind you the Sentinel program is a cost-plus program.David F. KefferRight. And to that point, among the fixed price programs where we talked about the 70% of that 2021 backlog having been transitioned into sales by the end of this year. There are no huge individual drivers of the remaining 30%, if you will, and that will gradually translate into sales over the next few years. So a gradual wind down of the remaining 30% based on the metrics we described earlier.Jason Michael GurskyOkay. Right. And then -- I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here on the Space margins. But I did find your comment, Kathy, interesting about the potential for the business to operate above 10%. I think you said you want to drive it to 10%, but there would be opportunities for it potentially to go above that metric at some point in the future. I'm just kind of curious as to whether that is a comment for the broad portfolio of your space programs? Because when I historically think of spacecraft and space-based assets, I tend to think of lower margin rates for that kind of work historically because it's been a lot of cost-plus kind of work. So I'm wondering if this is a comment about the broad portfolio and would include assets that are going to be operating up in Space. And is that comment -- if that is true, is it because you've got more fixed price work going on there than has historically been the case.Kathy J. WardenYes. So as you think about the transition that the Space market has gone to where we had few large and exquisite assets. Those were largely developed under cost-plus and then transition to production, but in low quantity. Now we're seeing much less dollars go into development and then a transition into production of higher quantity. So that mix will be different in terms of development versus production in the market as a whole. In addition, when you think about our portfolio and what's in our Space segment, it includes things like solid rocket motors, particularly large solid rocket motors. It includes programs like Sentinel that will transition into production, and programs like Kuiper that we've talked about. So as those transitions happen again specifically now to our portfolio, not just the market in general for Space, we see mix shifts that will be tailwinds to margin over time.Todd B. ErnstAnd Josh, we have time for one more question.OperatorAnd our last question comes from Rob Spingarn with Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnKathy, just sticking with that a little bit and tying this to the prime versus merchant supplier discussion we had in the beginning on Aeronautics. When you think about the shift, at least in satellites from GEOs to MEOs and LEOs in these highly proliferated constellations. And the significance of SDA in that part of the market and their desire for fixed price contracts. Is it better, at least in that kind of work to be on the supplier side at some point, would you consider that?Kathy J. WardenWe consider it with each opportunity, just as I discussed in our thought process around military aircraft. We don't have a blanket. We will do this, and we won't do not. We think about each opportunity in terms of its risk profile. The maturity of our designs and offerings at the time that we're being asked to bid also weighs heavily into our thinking about that decision. And so in the case of the Space Development Agency, we are executing on several programs for them today and performing quite well. .So we have chosen wisely and been disciplined in how we have taken on that work, and we'll continue to do that. The beauty of our portfolio, as we've talked about before, is we can choose to prime. But if we don't see the right mix of risk reward, we can also choose to be a supplier and still bring the capability forward that the government needs and expects from us. Great. Well, I think that's about all we have time for. So thank you to each of you for joining our call today. I also again want to extend my appreciation to the Northrop Grumman team for their continued strong performance and contributions to global security. I hope that all of you enjoy the remainder of your summer, and I look forward to seeing you throughout the summer and talking to you again in October. Take care.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.]"

""We had eight potential new customers come in for a demonstration of our IBCS capabilities - our integrated battle management system - that has been in very high demand.""Munitions and missile defenses were two other high-demand areas Keffer highlighted.European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on cheaper, less-sophisticated items such as shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine's war efforts.Northrop's aeronautic systems business, which houses its new B21 Raider jet program, posted a 2% rise in sales at $2.60 billion in the second quarter.Sales in its space system business, which makes satellites and payloads, jumped 17% to $3.49 billion, helped by a surge in investment for space exploration projects.Story continuesNorthrop raised the lower end of its annual profit forecast from $22.25 per share. It now expects 2023 profit to be in the range of $22.45 to $22.85 per share.The company also raised its annual sales outlook to between $38.4 billion and $38.8 billion, compared with its previous projection of $38 billion to $38.4 billion.Its net earnings came in at $812 million, or $5.34 per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $6.06 a year earlier.Northrop's overall sales in the quarter rose 9% to $9.57 billion.

Corporation VFC is likely to register top and bottom-line decreases from the year-ago quarter’s reported figures when it posts first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Aug 1, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.06 billion, indicating an 8.9% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at a loss of 13 cents per share, suggesting a 244.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The metric has remained stable in the past 30 days.V.F. Corp. has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.8%.V.F. Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseV.F. Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseV.F. Corporation price-eps-surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteOn its last earnings call, V.F. Corp. provided a tepid outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, implying soft performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expected the fiscal first quarter to reflect the impacts of sluggishness in the Americas region on account of a tough wholesale environment. It anticipates revenues from its brands to be impacted by lower wholesale sales in the spring season. For first-quarter fiscal 2024, the company predicts a revenue decline in the high-single digits, indicating a challenging U.S. wholesale environment.VFC also expects SG&amp;A deleverage for the fiscal first quarter due to lower volumes. This, along with the promotional environment in North America, is likely to weigh on the bottom-line performance for the to-be-reported quarter.On the positive front, the company has been benefiting from Supreme’s strong follower base in the younger generation, even when consumers are moving away from apparel to essential spending. VFC’s brand portfolio, strength in its outdoor unit driven by The North Face brand and solid momentum in the international business are likely to have boosted its performance in the fiscal first quarter.V.F. Corp. also remains committed on its operational execution and cost-saving actions, which are expected to have boosted its margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company’s focus on lowering working capital and optimizing inventories is likely to have been tailwinds. For the fiscal first quarter, our model indicates gross margin to expand 120 basis points to 55.3% on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for V.F.

The lengthy proposal is based on the international Basel standard and has been long-awaited by the banking industry. If the proposals go into effect, it would be one of the biggest overhauls of U.S. banking regulation since the 2008 financial crisis. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains the new proposals.Video Transcript- Well, US regulators have released a long-awaited proposal that would see the biggest banks boost their capital requirements. The measures, released by the Federal Reserve and FDIC, would boost those requirements for banks with at least $100 billion in assets by an estimated 16%. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has the details. David, talk us through this.DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, it's a sweeping proposal we're looking at right now. More than a thousand pages. In aggregate, 16% increase to bank capital requirements. And these are for the large banks. Importantly, a lot of this is based off of the international Basel standards and have been interpreted by US regulators.Newer things that have been added in include taking these requirements and sort of extending it to all banks above $100 billion in assets. So that sort of widens what has been a long-awaited regulatory change to something that's more of a reflection of things that have happened this year. Also importantly, the unrealized losses for available for sale.Securities, which previously had been something that banks didn't have to account for, has been changed. So now that is a part of something that banks do have to account for. At a high level though, you know, this impacts the most-- the giants of the industry. That's those with large trading desks and also just coast-to-coast bank franchises. Their capital requirements are expected to rise 19% on average.For the smaller-- I say smaller, but the banks with $250 billion assets or more. They're going to see their average capital requirements rise by about 10%. And then the smallest of this group, those between $100 and $250 billion assets, will see their capital requirements rise about 5% on average. So officials have argued that the changes are needed to improve the resilience and to better prepare banks for future losses. And that's what this is all about.Story continuesAgain, the changes are going to affect the largest banks. But the new thing here, and it has a lot to do with what's happened over the past year, is that it's going to incorporate the smaller larger banks, I guess we would say, which looks roughly like the top 30 at this point. Now there is going to be a phase-in period, and banks are expected to be able to comment for the next 120 days on this. And we're sure to hear some feedback from what they think of the new rules.But in general, we're looking at sort of a July 2025 period to begin these new rules to phase in for the banks. And then after that, sort of they will become official in 2028-- July 2028, excuse me.- All right. We're going to be tracking closely that timeline there. David, thanks so much.]"

""We are satisfied with the way we are structured in China today and our focus is delivering those medicines to patients and partnering with local biotech companies in particular.""AstraZeneca stood by its 2023 outlook.Separately, the company said on Friday its unit Alexion has agreed to buy U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio for up to $1 billion, plus royalties on sales to bolster its genomic medicine capabilities.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.75, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99. In the year-ago quarter, BMY posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.93.Total revenues of $11.23 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.8 billion. Revenues also decreased by 6% from the year-ago period due to generic competition for the multiple myeloma (MM) drug Revlimid, partially offset by in-line products (primarily Opdivo) and new product portfolios (primarily Opdualag, Abecma and Reblozyl). The company’s shares have lost 11.9% in the year so far compared with the industry's decline of 11.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly DetailsRevenues decreased 5% to $7.9 billion in the United States due to lower sales of Revlimid as a result of generic erosion and an increase in the number of patients receiving free drug products for Revlimid and, to a lesser extent, Pomalyst, from the company’s patient assistance program. International revenues decreased 8% to $3.3 billion in the quarter due to generic erosion for Revlimid and Eliquis as well as lower average net selling prices, partially offset by Opdivo.Revenues from in-line and new product portfolios increased by 4% to $9.5 billion.Total in-line product revenues came in at $8.6 billion. Within this segment, Eliquis’ sales were down 1% to $3.2 billion, missing our model estimate of $3.3 billion and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.4 billion. Sales in the United States increased 7% to $2.3 billion. Revenues in international markets declined 17% to $864 million, primarily driven by generic erosion in Canada and the U.K.Bristol-Myers has a collaboration agreement with Pfizer PFE for Eliquis. The companies collaborated in 2007. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMY a sales-based fee.Story continuesSales of the immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, approved for multiple cancer indications, were up 4% year over year to $2.1 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion and our estimate of $2.4 billion. Sales in the United States grew by 2%. Revenues in the international markets were up 7%, driven by higher demand as a result of additional indication launches and core indications, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts.Another MM drug, Pomalyst, generated sales of $847 million, down 7% year over year.Sales of the rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia increased 6% to $927 million.Leukemia drug Sprycel generated sales of $458 million, down 16% year over year due to a 24% decline in international sales.Melanoma drug Yervoy contributed $585 million to the top line, up 11%.New product portfolio revenues were $862 million compared with $482 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher demand for Reblozyl (up 36% to $234 million), Abecma ($132 million), Opdualag ($154 million), Breyanzi ($100 million) and Zeposia ($100 million). However, Revlimid revenues declined 41% to $1.5 billion from the year-ago quarter due to lower demand as a result of generic erosion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was $1.7 billion and our estimate was $1.6 billion. Abraxane revenues were up 7% to $258 million.Adjusted research and development expenses decreased by 2% to $2.2 billion in the quarter.

So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors.While the top 14 EV stocks had a market capitalization representing only 13% of that of the Top 10 vehicle manufacturers as of the end of 2019, they still managed to outperform them. That trend continued through last year, both with EV and battery stocks.Electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with their market share steadily climbing, from less than 5% of new cars sold in 2020 to 14% in 2022. In the first quarter of this year, we already saw a 25% jump in sales, year-on-year.But this space has become extremely crowded, resulting in a price war that is making investors uneasy.It’s time to find a new niche in the EV segment where first-movers have a very clear advantage: electric boating, where innovators hope to take the EV revolution off-road. The waterways are going electric, too.That’s why the next big thing in racing is all-electric, with NFL superstar Tom Brady joining the UIM E1 World Championship with ownership of an electric boat racing team. The inaugural season of the EV boating world championship is set to launch in early 2024.The electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.The newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries expected to start this summer.The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E- Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.Story continuesThe company is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year and is aggressively pursuing an electric disruption to the boat rental market, with franchise plans well underway. While it’s been all about build-out and launch over the past couple of years, VMAR is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive next year, and it’s not burning cash like its road warrior brethren.The Sound of Silence OpportunityThe global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031.Narrowing that down by type, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is set to hit $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% during that time period.As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself. Not only is the marine battery market forecast to grow by 18.6% to 2030, but it represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.And while climate change is a key element propping up the electric boating industry, it’s not the only ‘attraction’:Electric boats are quiet. They completely change the boating aesthetic by removing the sound of the loud outdoor motor, which overwhelms all other sound at sea.They’re safe, too.  There’s no risk of gasoline leaks or carbon monoxide poisoning common with internal combustion engines.The consensus seems to be that electric boat motors, by design, are more robust than their loud and dirty predecessors, and they also require a lot less frequent maintenance than a gasoline engine. They’re cheaper to operate over the long-run: No oil changes, no filters or tune-ups, and while combustion engines require maintenance every 100 hours, electric motors (on average) can go up to 3,000 hoursThe World’s Most Powerful Electric PowerTrainVision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a cost perspective, it out-competes everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR),  E-Motion motor isn’t confined to speedboats, either; they’re turning pontoon boats into faster, better and cleaner versions of themselves.VMAR is in the process of equipping a pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America (and possibly in the world). VMAR’s Zenith pontoon will set off in Virginia on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey to Miami, Florida, to showcase the capabilities of sustainable electric power.How they plan to market the E-Motion Powertrain is the part that should sound more attractive to investors who may or may not have been taken for a wild ride with EV investments. VMAR isn’t trying to manufacturer its own boats, which would mean burning through cash at an untenable rate (just like all the smaller EV companies right now). Instead, it’s marketing E-Motion to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and they’ve already received an impressive volume of orders.Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received and initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024.But the bigger picture is this: VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system turns any boat into an electric boat, which makes its strategy to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs an incredibly savvy one in a market flooded with EV makers who are spending more money than they might ever make.A Second, Disruptive Revenue ChainVMAR also plans to plug in the boat rental market.The global boat rental market (across all boat types) was valued at $18.2 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $31.2 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2031. It’s a huge market that is about to go electric.And, again, VMAR has first-mover advantage.VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model.By 2024, it’s expected to be full speed ahead with scaling.The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.By the end of 2024, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR),  expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.Other companies to keep an eye on:Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is a prominent player in the chip manufacturing and research sector.

DEO has been benefiting from its diversified footprint, advantaged portfolio, strong brands and favorable industry trends of premiumization. The company has been witnessing solid business momentum, strong consumer demand and market share gains, which have been boosting its performance. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution bode well.However, inflation, stemming from higher glass, ocean freight and transportation costs, has been a headwind for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Currency headwinds are also concerning.The alcoholic beverage company, which reports on a half-yearly basis, posted robust sales growth, operating margin expansion and productivity savings, which aided earnings in the first half of fiscal 2023.Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDiageo plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Diageo plc QuoteKey Factors to NoteDEO is anticipated to have retained the strength in its business in fiscal 2023 through constant premiumization efforts, recovery across markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings.DEO is well-poised for growth from effective marketing and extraordinary commercial execution. It is likely to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO in the near and long terms. Gains from its marketing actions are expected to get reflected in its margin performance for fiscal 2023.The company’s margin trends were favorable in the first half of fiscal 2023, thanks to its premiumization efforts, ongoing market recovery, pricing actions and disciplined cost management. Organic operating profit is likely to have benefited from the leverage in operating costs, driven by disciplined cost management. Supply productivity savings and price increases are also expected to have contributed to margin growth despite the impacts of higher cost inflation on the gross margin.On the last reported earnings call, the company expected the fiscal 2023 organic operating margin to benefit from continued premiumization trends, everyday efficiencies and operating expense leverage, offset by strong investments in marketing.Our model had predicted an operating margin, on a GAAP basis, of 29.7% for fiscal 2023, reflecting an expansion of 120 basis points (bps) from the prior-year reported figure. The operating margin, before pre-exceptional items, is expected to decline 110 bps year over year to 29.9%.For fiscal 2023, DEO anticipated organic net sales growth across North America to normalize through the second half of fiscal 2023, whereas it reported double-digit growth in the year-ago period. In Europe, organic net sales growth is likely to moderate in the second half of fiscal 2023, as the company laps the on-trade channel re-opening and recovery in the prior year.DEO anticipates continued organic net sales growth for the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean and Africa in the second half of fiscal 2023, although at a moderated pace than strong growth reported in fiscal 2022.However, Diageo has been suffering from persistent inflationary pressures induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.Diageo expects to continue its revenue-management initiatives, including pricing actions, throughout fiscal 2023 to overcome the challenging inflationary environment.In the second half of fiscal 2023, the company expects cost inflation pressure to persist and has been committed to investing in its brands to deliver sustainable growth. DEO expects marketing investment to increase more than sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2023.

247,43b7c938-a482-36c5-8d95-b145c5ea21e7,TAP,2023-07-28,Altria Group (MO) Queues for Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/altria-group-mo-queues-q2-122700532.html,1690460820,STORY,"['MO', 'CHD', 'TAP-A']","[Altria Group, Inc. MO is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5,447 million, suggesting 1.4% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has dropped by a penny to $1.31 per share over the past 30 days. The projection indicates an increase of nearly 4% from the figure reported in the year-ago period quarter. Altria Group has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 0.6%, on average.Factors to ConsiderAltria Group has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has helped the company stay firm, even amid soft cigarette shipment volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.In the first quarter of 2023, higher pricing offered respite to revenues across the Smokeable Products and Oral Tobacco categories, which were otherwise hurt by lower volumes. Higher pricing aided the adjusted operating companies income (OCI) in both segments. The continuation of such trends is likely to have remained an upside.Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAltria Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Altria Group, Inc. QuoteWith reduced-risk products (RRPs) gaining popularity, Altria Group has been offering several oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco products.  To this end, on! is a worthwhile addition to the company’s smokeless portfolio as oral TDN products are gaining popularity in the United States due to their low-risk claims. Management continues to expand the manufacturing capacity and the commercial availability of the product.Net revenues in the Oral Tobacco Products segment rose 2.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $628 million in the first quarter of 2023. The upside can be attributed to improved pricing.In the first quarter, on! reported shipment volumes grew 38% to 25.2 million cans. on! saw its share of the total oral tobacco category increase by 2.4 share points to 6.5% in the quarter. These upsides bode well for the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Oral Tobacco Products revenues is pegged at $665 million, in line with the figure reported in the year-ago period.However, soft Smokeable Products volumes have been a concern. In the first quarter, domestic cigarette shipment volumes decreased 11.4%, mainly due to the industry’s decline rate, retail share losses and trade inventory movements, partly countered by calendar differences. The industry’s decline and retail share losses were a result of macroeconomic pressure on Adult Tobacco Consumers’ disposable income.On its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that consumers’ discretionary income remained pressurized due to a rise in overall inflation. Increased inflation has been causing consumers to alter their buying patterns, which has been weighing on cigarette industry volumes since the second quarter of 2022.The company plans to continue assessing these aspects and their impacts on tobacco consumers throughout this year, per the last earnings call. Cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Smokeable Products revenues is pegged at $5,894 million compared with $5,873 million reported in the year-ago period.Apart from this, management’s bottom-line view for 2023 takes into account planned investments associated with costs to improve the digital consumer engagement system, enhanced smoke-free product research, development and marketplace activities to support the company’s smoke-free products. These factors may have affected the bottom line in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Altria Group this time.

The agency will release its proposal to hike CAFE requirements for 2027 and beyond on Friday, sources familiar with the agency's plans said, after the White House signed off on Tuesday.A Biden administration official said under one scenario the auto industry could face about $3 billion in fuel economy penalties in 2032 and in another it might face essentially no penalties.Another official told Reuters NHTSA's preferred CAFE proposal is estimated to save consumers more than $50 billion on fuel over a vehicles' lifetime and reduce oil use by more than 88 billion gallons through 2050. Overall, the benefits of the rule would exceed costs by more than $18 billion, the official added.GM, which in 2021 vowed to halt the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, said this month it could face compliance challenges under the EV efficiency rules and vehicle emissions regulations. The company said on Thursday it looks forward to ""further and increased technical dialogue with the EPA and the White House as the rule is finalized.""Story continuesNHTSA's plan will follow the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) April proposal to toughen 2027-2032 standards, requiring a 56% emissions cut that would result in 67% of new vehicles by 2032 being EVs.A group representing major automakers including the Detroit Three wants EPA to significantly soften its requirements, calling it ""neither reasonable nor achievable.""Chrysler parent Stellantis and GM paid a total of $363 million in civil penalties for failing to meet CAFE requirements for prior model years, Reuters reported in June. The record-setting penalties include $235.5 million for Stellantis for the 2018 and 2019 model years and $128.2 million for GM covering 2016 and 2017.The penalties were assessed against the companies' entire vehicle fleets not meeting the requirements.Automakers pay penalties if internal combustion-powered vehicles they sell do not meet CAFE standards or buy credits from other automakers to meet requirements. They can also sell electric vehicles to help offset vehicles that do not meet requirements.

Ford's results come after its crosstown rival GM (GM) reported strong earnings and raised its full-year profit guidance for a second time.For the quarter, Ford reported top-line revenue of $45.0 vs $40.17 billion expected, a 12% improvement from the $37.91 billion it reported a year ago and sequentially higher than Q1's $41.5 billion. Ford posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 0.72, a big beat over the $0.54 consensus estimate, and adjusted EBIT of $3.8 billion.In terms of full-year guidance, Ford raised its full-year 2023 guidance for adjusted EBIT to between $11 billion and $12 billion, where previously it saw $9 billion-$11 billion. Ford also lifted its adjusted free cash flow forecast to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, from a prior $6 billion projection.For its business level full-year projections, Ford boosted profit guidance for Ford Blue and Ford Pro, but increased its loss projection for Ford Model e.

Ford also now expects to reach a 600,000-unit EV production run rate during 2024, instead of the end of this year, on the way to achieving a 2 million annual run rate.“The near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected, which is going to benefit early movers like Ford,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “EV customers are brand loyal and we’re winning lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products; we’re making smart investments in capabilities and capacity around the world; and, while others are trying to catch up, we have clean-sheet, next-generation products in advanced development that will blow people away.”Story continuesFord F-150 Lightning during the 2022 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS) at the Javits Center on April 13, 2022 in New York.

The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker saw sales gains across most of its truck and SUV portfolio. In particular, Ford trucks, with its crown jewel F-150 pickup lineup, notched a 34% sales jump. Total Ford truck sales were up 26.2%, which Ford says makes it the top-selling truck maker in the US.Somewhat worrying for Ford and investors was a dip in EV sales, with the company noting EV sales dropped 2.8% for the quarter, with Mustang Mach-E sales down 21.1% and its E-Transit electric van sales down 23.8%. However, Ford did say Mach-E sales ""quickened"" at the end of Q2.Ford also drastically cut the prices of its F-150 Lightning EV pickup earlier this month, claiming falling raw material costs and ""continued work on scaling production and cost"" at its Rouge factory allowed for the price reductions. It's possible the continued sales success of Rivian's R1T pickup, rising inventories, and the impending release of Tesla's Cybertruck played a part in the decision.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It later put off a vote on the deal.North American pilots have been commanding higher salaries and improved working conditions with travel demand remaining buoyant, despite airlines raising fares to cover higher costs.The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents over 15,000 American Airlines pilots, did not specify the value of the revised deal. But American Airlines CEO Robert Isom last week said bringing the proposed four-year contract in line with United's deal would enhance its value by more than $1 billion, making it worth well over $9 billion.Its revised contract includes a provision that will allow an adjustment in pay rates for pilots to match wages of their counterparts at United and Delta Air Lines, which had set the new U.S. industry standard with a deal ratified in March.The American Airlines revised deal also provides pilots full back pay for this year.In line with United's deal, pay increases for American Airlines' pilots will now take place on January 1 instead of May 2 as provided in the original deal.The APA said the revised agreement needs an approval from its board, after which it would be sent for a ratification vote. A union spokesperson said the board would meet on Aug. 2-3 to review the deal.An American Airlines spokesperson described the revised deal as a contract that its pilots deserve.Jefferies analysts estimate the United States is short about 10,000 pilots, with the supply-demand gap projected to last until 2027.Story continuesWhile the APA reached a tentative deal with American Airlines in May, the union argued its proposed pay rates as well as some quality-of-life items in the agreement paled in comparison with those in United's preliminary deal.For example, the APA pressed for additional sick days to meet gains secured at Delta and United.Airline unions negotiate their contracts in a pattern bargaining process, where a deal at one carrier acts as a benchmark for other companies.Southwest Airlines is now the only major U.S. carrier that is without a new pilot contract deal.

This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001. Notably, since March 2022, the central bank hiked its interest rate in 10 consecutive FOMC meetings before giving a pause in the June 2023 meeting. It again reinitiated the rate hiking regime as the inflation rate remained elevated, at almost double the Fed’s 2% target rate.In his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said ""The process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."" Powell also accepted the fact that the aggregate price level has moderated steadily since June 2022.According to Powell, “I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting. The FOMC will be assessing the totality of the incoming data” and its implications for economic activity and inflation.Importantly, a 25-basis point rise in interest rate was fully priced in market valuations. Moreover, the Fed Chairman did not surprise either in positive or negative direction with his comment. Consequently, Wall Street did not react overwhelmingly. The Dow rose 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1% and the S&amp;P 500 remained almost flat.Stock Selection ProcessAt his stage, we have adopted three stock selection criteria that will strengthen investor’s portfolio. First, select those stocks that have released impressive second-quarter 2023 earnings results with solid guidance. Second, select stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and earnings beat will drive stock prices in the near future. Third, select corporate giants (market capital &gt; 100 billion) as these companies enjoy a robust business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and strong financial position.Story continuesOur Top Picks Based on the above-mentioned criteria, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.39 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for International Paper: mixed.

I'm thrilled to share that we are now expecting double-digit yield growth for the full year and low teens growth rate for the remaining quarters.I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team for delivering another outstanding quarter. Their passion, dedication and commitment allow us to deliver the very best vacation experiences responsibly while generating strong financial results.Last year, we laid out Trifecta, which set clear and ambitious targets. We have made tremendous progress towards those goals and now expected to achieve record EBITDA per APCD and record return on invested capital this year. We are well on our way to achieving Trifecta as we continue to execute on our strategies.As highlighted on Slide 3, we delivered another outstanding quarter that exceeded expectations. The robust demand environment we reported back in May continued throughout the second quarter and translated into strong booking volumes and meaningfully higher prices.During the second quarter, we delivered a record 1.9 million memorable vacations and exceptional guest satisfaction scores. We achieved record yields that were 12.9% higher in 2019. Strong close-in demand, higher pricing and continued strength of onboard spend drove the revenue outperformance.While the Caribbean remains a standout performer this year, we were particularly pleased with the strength and quality of closing demand for European itineraries. This acceleration of demand for Europe contributed to the better-than-expected yield performance for the quarter. Our continued focus on enhancing margins and our disciplined capital allocation resulted in more than 100% of the revenue outperformance flowing to the bottom line. We had record adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter and achieved significantly better-than-expected earnings.Booking volume since our last earnings call have continued to accelerate, both for 2023 sailings and even more so for 2024 as the majority of the bookings we are currently taking are for next year's sailings.The North American consumer remains incredibly strong, and volumes from European consumers looking to book their summer vacations accelerated. The strength of our brands and quality of our vacation experiences combined with the value proposition of cruise is translating into double-digit yield growth expectations versus 2019 for the year and low teens growth rate for the second half of 2023. Our load factors are now back to normal. So the incredible yield growth is driven by strength in pricing and onboard spend for both new and like-for-like hardware.While it's still too early to provide any specific color for next year's outlook, clearly, the very healthy demand environment we are seeing is quite encouraging. There has been a lot of talk about the state of the consumer, and I want to share what we are seeing for millions of daily interactions with our customers.Sentiment remains strong and is bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages and excess savings. Our customers remain engaged and eager to vacation and build memories with us as they continue to shift preferences towards experiences over goods.Over the last few months, experience spend was up 25% compared to 2019 and double that of spend on goods. Despite this increase, spend on experiences remains lower than the long-term trend line, implying a multiyear catch-up opportunity. Our vacation platform is appealing to a broad range of vacationers and our addressable market continues to expand as we benefit from favorable demographics and wealth trends.In the second quarter, the percent of guests were either new to brand or new to cruise surpassed 2019 levels by a wide margin, and we have seen post-cruise repeat booking rates nearly double 2019 levels. While we have made positive strides in narrowing the gap to land-based vacations over the last several months, cruising remains an exceptional value proposition, allowing us to outperform broader leisure travel as we seek to further close the gap to land-based vacations, drive better revenue and welcome even more happy customers.Future cruise consideration is near all-time highs and a contributing factor to a doubling in website visits compared to 2019. In addition, our travel partners are now fully back up and running and delivering more bookings than they did in 2019.Our improved commercial capabilities have allowed us to capture this quality demand and expand our share of the guest wallet. In the second quarter, about 2/3 of our guests booked some of their onboard activities in advance of their cruise translating into incremental spend once on board. While we have made a significant leap, we are still in the early innings of our journey, and we continue to add new features and capabilities to our app in commercial engines. One thing is clear. Our guests continued to spend more on their vacation experience and our teams continue to deliver strong guest satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores. The robust demand we see for our products is bolstered by our industry-leading brands, innovative hardware, enhanced destination offerings, nimble global sourcing model and strong execution by our teams.New hardware has been a great differentiator for us, allowing us to drive quality demand and attract new customers into our vacation ecosystem. In 2023, we take delivery of 3 new ships that support our strategy and will deliver premium yields in 2024 and beyond. This month, Silversea welcomed Silver Nova, the first of the new Evolution class. Later this year, Celebrity Cruises will welcome Celebrity Ascent and Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of the game-changing Icon on the Seas late in Q4 with it's revenue sailings beginning in the end of January.Looking ahead into 2024, Royal Caribbean International has recently revealed the ultimate weekend getaway, Utopia of the Seas, which will join our fleet mid next year. Utopia will be the first Oasis-class ship that will be entirely focused on short cruises in the Caribbean, supporting our strategy of competing with land-based vacation alternatives and driving new-to-cruise customers into our vacation ecosystem as we seek to close the value gap.Demand and pricing for Utopia has far exceeded our expectations. Also, in 2024, Silversea will welcome the second in the Evolution Class, Silver Ray, delivering the future of ultra-luxury cruising. Demand for Ray is very strong, and it is attracting the highest rates for the brand's Classic fleet.We continue our efforts to deepen the relationship with the customer. We are further enhancing our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels build even more customer loyalty and lower our acquisition costs. We continue to enhance our e-commerce and precruise capabilities and are seeing increased guest repeat rates and spend as well as further elevation in the overall guest experience. We will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost control will lead to enhanced margins, profitability and superior financial performance.In conclusion, our business and our amazing team on and off the water are firing on all cylinders as we exceeded expectations in the second quarter, and significantly increased our earnings and cash flow guidance for 2023. We are well on our way to achieving our Trifecta goals. Our differentiated platform that includes the best brands, fleet, destination, people and global sourcing platform is winning. And I'm very proud of our teams that go out every day to deliver the best vacations responsibly. And with that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf?Naftali HoltzThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by discussing our results for the second quarter. We delivered another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $1.82, 17% higher than the midpoint of our May guidance.We finished the second quarter with a load factor of 105% and with net yields that were up 12.9% versus 2019, about 260 basis points higher than the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, about half of the yield growth was driven by new hardware and half driven by a significant increase in rates on like-for-like hardware despite being a bit behind on load factors.Rates were up 17% in the second quarter compared to 2019. NCC, excluding fuel per APCD increased 9% compared to the second quarter of 2019. While our costs came in consistent with our May guidance, the increase in our share price and the significant increase in our financial outlook for the year resulted in higher stock-based compensation.This cost, which contributed 220 basis points to the quarter was offset by favorable timing that will shift into the third quarter. Our operational and commercial teams are doing an exceptional job driving strong top line growth and maintaining focus on operating expenses to expand margins.Our EBITDA margin in the second quarter has recovered to it's 2019 levels and over 100% of the revenue outperformance during this quarter dropped to the bottom line, leading to significant earnings beat versus our guidance. As Jason mentioned, booking volumes since our last earnings call significantly exceeded 2019 for both North American and European consumers.Caribbean itineraries account for about 55% of our full year capacity and about 37% in the third quarter. Strong demand for Caribbean itineraries contributed to the strong performance in the second quarter and is one of the key drivers of the increase in expectations for the full year.Europe sailings account for 17% of our full year capacity and 35% in the third quarter. The acceleration in demand is resulting in an increase in our revenue expectations for Europe sailings. The better-than-expected performance has mostly been driven by our European customers, which underscores our nimble and global sourcing model.Alaska only accounts for 6% of our full year capacity, but represents 16% in the third quarter. We have added 3 additional ships to the region with capacity up about 60% versus 2019 for this high-yielding product. Similar to the Caribbean, we have seen very strong volume trends for Alaska sailings and load factors have been above 2019 since early this year and in line with our expectations.Now let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about increased guidance expectations for the full year 2023. We now expect net yield growth of 11.5% to 12% for the full year, about 450 basis point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. About 15% of the increase is driven by the strong second quarter results with the remainder due to a significantly better business outlook for the rest of the year.The further increase in yield expectations for the year is the result of higher pricing and further strength in onboard revenue. Both new and like-for-like hardware are driving higher pricing for our core products. Yields for both remaining quarters are expected to be up in the low teens, with third quarter yields up 13.75% at the midpoint of our guidance range and an acceleration throughout the year.Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 7% for the full year as compared to 2019. Our cost outlook reflects the continued benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. As I mentioned before, the increase in full year 2023 costs is mainly a result of increase in stock compensation expense. We also recently announced our return to China in spring of 2024. In anticipation of this return, we plan to increase our cost in support of the restart.As I noted on the last earnings call, full year net cruise costs also include 210 basis points of structural cost that we did not have in 2019, mostly related to operations of CocoCay and our Galveston terminal. Our team's focus on delivering the best vacation experiences responsibly while enhancing profitability is translating to the bottom line.For the second half of the year, 90% of the increase in revenue expectation flows through to earnings and increases our margin. We also expect record adjusted EBITDA per APCD for the year and an EBITDA margin that is an eyelash away from our previous record in 2019.So in summary, based on the current business outlook, along with current fuel pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $6 to $6.20. Now turning to Slide 7. I will discuss our third quarter guidance. Net yields are expected to be up 13.5% to 14% compared to 2019. Exceptional strength in Caribbean itineraries and accelerating demand for Europe itineraries is driving the increase in yields.NCC, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 11.2%. About half of the cost increase compared to 2019 relates to structural costs, timing shift of operating expenses from the second quarter and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.Many factors contribute to variability in cost growth within quarters, and our focus is on full year cost management. With that said, we expect costs in the second half to normalize to the yearly average with fourth quarter benefiting from a more favorable comparable mainly due to increased dry dock days in 2019.So in summary, based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.38 to $3.48 for the third quarter.Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in liquidity and generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow during the second quarter. Our liquidity remains very strong and strengthening the balance sheet continues to be a top priority. Better-than-expected cash flow generation and our disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage and debt levels with the goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics. Utilizing cash flow from operations, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt during the quarter, including $392 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes due June 2025.Also during the quarter, we settled the 4.25% convertible notes that were due in June with $337 million of cash and 370,000 shares. Then in July, we redeemed an additional $300 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes due June 2025. As a result, we only have $700 million of those notes currently outstanding. That paydown actions will reduce interest expense in 2023 and beyond and contribute to further increase in earnings as we chip away at our high-cost debt.As for leverage, this year, we will have $3.2 billion of debt related to new ship deliveries that are contributing minimal to no EBITDA in 2023. When excluding this debt from the calculation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the mid 4x by the end of the year, a significant progress toward our goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics.As our business accelerates and generates more cash flow, we will continue to proactively and methodically pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings in support of our Trifecta goals. In closing, our business continues to accelerate, and we remain committed and focused on executing our strategy and delivering on our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Lasinski with Stifel.Steven Moyer WieczynskiFirst off, congratulations, another very, very strong quarter. So Jason, as we think about the Trifecta targets, it seems to us based on the trajectory of the business, there now is probably somewhat of a high probability that some of these targets could be achieved possibly a full year in advance of your current 2025 time frame. So based on the strong demand you're seeing already for '24, is it fair to assume that achieving some of these targets much earlier than you were expecting was a fair statement. And look, I know that's kind of a quasi 24 guidance question, but just based on the current trends, it does just seem like you guys are on that path.Jason T. LibertyWell, thanks, Steven, and good morning, and good morning to everybody. I hope everybody is doing well. So first, I would say, Steve, as we pointed out with Trifecta, Trifecta was, as we described it as base camp. We think there's a lot value to unlock here in the company as we -- as our people and our brands just continue to execute as we grow our business. And so as you pointed out, the current trends that we have been seeing, especially in the booking environment points to many of these metrics being able to be achieved earlier than we had anticipated them to be. And of course, we believe very much as we have in the past, that setting coordinates and pointing the organization to those coordinates is very important to make sure that we execute on them and beyond.As we get closer to those metrics, we will certainly look to talk about what's the next base camp or base camp 2 that will be pointing the organization to. But as you said, when we look at these at the trends, the booking environment, how we're executing the preference for our brands, and us, again, being able to further close the gap here to what we see as really the competitive set with land-based vacation, the outlook looks really bright. And so I think we would say that it looks -- these trends would point to an earlier arrival at base camp, but we're not in a position as it's too early for us to say exactly what that timing is going to be.Steven Moyer WieczynskiOkay. Got you. And then second question, I guess, just around your booking visibility today, which seems like it's probably as good as it's ever been. And I guess my question is, I think historically, you've turned the calendar year, let's say, a 55%, 60% kind of booked range. And I know it's still early on, but based on your current marketing plans, the current strong demand that's out there, not only from the North American side of things, but now it seems like your European customers are getting stronger. Do you expect, if we kind of fast forward to the end of December moving into January, you could turn the calendar year at a higher book position versus where you've been historically?Jason T. LibertyWell, I think what -- so obviously, in our commentary about how us being booked, how we're booked ahead on rate volume in our booking environment, especially -- and most of these bookings are relating to 2024. We feel really strong or really good about the demand environment, and that very much points to 2024. What I would say is it is very possible that we're in a more book position than we have been in the past. But I would just -- we've said this in the past, our goal is to optimize revenue. And so you could be plus or minus 5% on a book position standpoint as we kind of cross periods because we're looking to optimize revenue, not just optimize how much you have on the books at a certain point in time. And I think our teams have demonstrated even as you see as we crossed the (inaudible), our ability to utilize what we would say are state-of-the-art tools to manage and optimize our revenue, not just on ticket, but also on onboard is what's helping us lead to optimizing our yield profile.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyGreat, obviously, really strong results. Just looking at your expense guidance outside of just the compensation that's tied to your performance, it hasn't really changed. It looks like despite a lot of higher expense out there in general. So I know it's early to talk about 2024, but if your higher expense hasn't sort of worsened over the last few quarters, does that give you the visibility that maybe 2024 expense could look kind of like a normal year in terms of the increase year-over-year, if the outlook hasn't been worsening for you as it maybe has for some others.Naftali HoltzRobin, so yes, first of all, all the expected guidance that we've shared today is really the result of all the actions that we talked about and really our team's exceptional job of managing expenses and expanding margin as our yield is growing. And obviously, in 2023, we were comparing to 2019, that was 4 years ago. So as we look into 2024, there is anything -- nothing that is extraordinary. There are a couple of things that are going to be a little bit structural, -- for example, we are opening HideAway Beach, but generally, it should be a normal year.Jason T. LibertyYes. And Robin, I just wanted to add into it because I do think it's important to recognize, if you kind of string together the calls through the pandemic and all the actions that we took to position ourselves to really kind of outperform and to grow our margins. A lot of all that work really helped absorb the vast majority of pretty significant inflation that we saw across a lot of the items that impact our product. And so we were able to really absorb that and still produce significant Net Promoter Score. So very, very thoughtful of not impacting the product or the experience, which could be easily done to help something in the short term. But in the long term, but it has really paid off for us as there is clear and very strong preference on a vacation standpoint to travel with the group and the great brands that are inside of it.Robin Margaret FarleyThat's great. And then just 1 clarification on -- you mentioned restarting China in April of 2024. Can you give us a sense of what that might obviously, some start-up costs to that any way to sort of quantify the magnitude of that?Michael W. BayleyRobin, it's Michael. And I happen to be very fortunate today because I'm calling you from beautiful Allure of the Seas sitting in our conference room, using our StarLink technology to video conference with my colleagues and participate in the call. We're on the President's crews. We have over 3,500 of our loyal guests along with 2,500 other guests on this great voice. So I'm actually sitting here in my swimwear, but you can't see that. But I have to tell you that -- only to say that it's just an amazing thing to be back with our loyal guests on the product and the brand, and it's quite amazing when you kind of immerse yourself with the customer, the kind of incredible feedback they give you in the loyalty with so many of our guests have Roll Caribbean. It's really -- it's a beautiful thing. On China, yes, we've open for sale. We had a kind of a thoughtful process as it relates to bringing back our employees over time. So as we move through '23, we obviously take on more SG&amp;A expense, and we have accommodated that in the forecast, obviously, and we also mitigated some of that expense. And then as we look into 2024, it will be a full year of typical operations for a one-ship operation with a lot of shared services provided by our Singapore office.I can tell you that the -- it's early days yet, but the signals look pretty positive. We feel good about what we're seeing in terms of bookings, and we feel pretty comfortable with operations and how we scale back our teams to sell and market and operate our China operation.Steven Moyer WieczynskiYes. And just, Robin, to your question, the increase between our May guidance and in cost and what you have today is entirely as a result of the stock-based compensation which is the majority of that increase and a little bit of that China expense that Michael was talking about.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays.Brandt Antoine MontourAn excellent quarter. So first on European consumer demand. You mentioned it several times, and it was clearly 1 of the surprising positive takeaways here. Just maybe if you could give us a sense of how you measure the European consumers recovery versus how you measure the U.S. Consumers recovery index to '19? Just trying to get a sense how far back the European consumer is so that we can kind of get a sense if there's sort of further recovery from that source to go?Jason T. LibertyBrandt, I think I would position in less about their recovery in terms of what their willingness is to spend because their willingness to spend was very competitive with the North American consumer. I think the difference is that they were delayed and kind of activating their vacation. And so they were as we talked a little bit about on the May call, we expected Europe to be a little bit lighter versus '19 in terms of load factor and it came roaring back, and that's a story of 1 of the North American consumer just feeling that they needed to -- for certainly vacation in Europe, but also the European consumer kind of was very much part of that story. So I think it's less about what they can afford to spend or what they are spending, I think it was more that they were -- they were delayed by, call it, 45 to 60 days than what we typically would see in a normal booking window. And again, these are things that are on the margins because we were substantially book, obviously, going into the summer for Europe.Brandt Antoine MontourOkay. That's super helpful. And then on '24, you guys have an exciting docket here with the Icon and the CocoCay expansion in China reopening. -- how would you sort of stack up those 3 things in terms of a tailwind to yield in the year of '24 if they're all something meaningful, eventually quantifiable?And then is there anything dilutive to yields in 24? I mean, China, I guess, could be dilutive because it's sort of a restart year and then utopia is a brand new ship, but it's in a short market. So how do we think about that?Michael W. BayleyBrandt, this is Michael. We don't see China as being dilutive. We feel very positive about China. And we certainly see Utopia as a big, strong game changer. And what we've seen so far from our bookings, both volume and rate, are incredibly encouraging. And we've been very thoughtful, as Jason mentioned earlier about the strategy of putting really outstanding hardware combined with excellent destination into the short product market because it truly is the on-ramp for new to cruise and also first to brand. So our indications as it relates to new product lineup coming online in '24 and exceptionally positive. And I'd also like to add that Icon and Utopia and, in fact, Wonder when you look at this gap between land-based resorts and land-based experiences versus some of our top products, particularly these products we're talking about, there really is no gap. The gap has been narrowed quite significantly, and we feel very positive about where we're going to go on that journey. So as we think about '24, as we look at these products, as we see what's occurring in terms of the booking activity both from a volume and rate perspective, the excitement we see for these products, we feel very positive about their impact in '24.Jason T. LibertyOne other just quick comment on the yield side of things, and this just goes into the booking commentary. Clearly, there is incredible demand for our new ships and Icon will certainly break and has broken, I think probably every record in the book. But I think it's important when we look at the data inside of our bookings that it's not just the new hardware -- the like-for-like is also very strong and growing. And in that commentary, as I said, is some of it is 2023, what we have left to book. So most of that commentary really relates to 2024.Naftali HoltzYes. And Brandt, I'll just add 2 more things. One is, obviously, we have this year, we are not returning to normal load factors, but the first half of the year was a little bit lower. So that should also contribute to yield next year. On the other hand, we are now in the planning process, obviously, for '24, and we're considering all the draggy talks that we need to do next year, and that could be more elevated than this year, which obviously will impact some of the cost a little bit on the yield.Jason T. LibertyYes. And the elevation on the dry dock is just a reflection of ships that came out of COVID that had missed those windows. And so it will be a little bit more elevated in 2024, but just a point.Brandt Antoine MontourThat's it for me. Congrats, again.Jason T. LibertyThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vince Clepiel with Cleveland Research Company.Vince Charles CiepielAnd nice to see on the results. I wanted to dig into the yield upside a little bit more. I know you mentioned it was a mix of onboard and ticket -- but when you think about, I think, 1Q beat by 4 points, 2Q beat by almost 3 points. And when you consider the volume of business kind of on the books going into the quarter, it seems to speak to price maybe on a leading-edge basis, really exhibiting a nice trajectory. So curious if you could kind of comment on that and how that informs kind of your approach to 2024 as you're thinking about kind of finding the balance in the booking curve.Jason T. LibertyWell, Vince, I hope you're doing well. As Naftali commented in his opening remarks, as we look at what kind of drove -- or one of the key drivers of the difference from the May guidance till today is really all price, right? So load factor for the back half of the year, we had expected to be normalized. And so I think what has been a surprise to us has just been our ability to continue to raise price and demand continuing to come in at higher levels -- significantly higher levels than we have seen in previous periods. And so I think it just talks to, I think, one, just preference for our brands. I mean how well -- our commercial teams have been executing and also keeping our customers more and more in our ecosystem has been a huge tailwind for us.And I think that kind of just a broader combination of things when you add that to just the value gap to land-based vacation is driving our ability to raise prices. And so as we said earlier, our APDs for the full year are up over double digits for the back half of the year, they're going to be in the low to mid-teens in terms of rate increase relative to 2019. That is significantly better than we had anticipated when we gave guidance earlier this year. And it's really a reflection of even as we take on the bookings and as we increase pricing, we're not really seeing that point where price is impacting our demand.And then the other component of this is just onboard spend, which is obviously a combination of -- to a degree of price. But really, the main driver of that has been our ability to be much more effective to curate and take friction out of the process for our customers to book their activities on the ship. And of course, there's a great commercial reasons of doing that. There's also an incredible guest experience benefit of doing that as our ultimate goal here is to try to give a day back to our guests to come on our ships and instead of them having to spend a day booking their restaurants and booking their spa appointments and short (inaudible) They're able to do that ahead of time. And we are really in the early innings of that, especially curating -- there's still a lot of friction points for us to resolve, but our teams have really just done an exceptional job of moving that forward, which you can also see supporting an even more elevated customer deposit balance as we're able to take on those onboard spend bookings.Vince Charles CiepielGreat. That's really helpful color. And I wanted to zoom in a little bit more on CocoCay. I think that you guys were on track to take about 2.5 million passengers there this year, kind of with a path towards $3.5 million in 2025. Curious kind of where '24 maybe falls within that window, if it's closer to 25% or 23%, and then -- just what you guys are seeing in terms of customer feedback around desire to repeat visits to CocoCay and maybe how you think about the decision to send Utopia icon to CocoCay as well?Michael W. BayleyWell, Vince, thank you for the question. I mean 1 of the reasons we call perfect day. Perfect day as it really is perfect. And it is driving a lot of the demand and people are booking the ships and the itineraries that sell to Perfect Day. It really is delivering an exceptional customer experience and people value that immensely. And we see the repeat rates going back to Perfect Day accelerating. As we look at the volume of guests, we've got a perfect day in '23, '24, '25. Obviously, we've planned to open HideAway Beach at the end of this year in time for Icon and utopia, that's going to increase our ability to add more guests to Perfect Day by about 3,000 people, and that will come online literally in December of this year. So that allows us then to continue to increase our capacity into Perfect Day. We've also got the Royal Beach Club in Nassau, which is moving through its various approval processes, environmental and governmental permits and what have you. That's looking as if it's promising and we're planning on opening the Royal Beach Club in summer of '25. So when you add that experience, the Royal Beach Club, along with Perfect Day, we feel like we genuinely have the ultimate big weekend. And that's, of course, why we've got Utopia coming online and going straight into the short market. So it's a great product. It's combined with incredible assets, the ships were sailing to Perfect Day. I don't think Perfect Day without these ships would be the complete perfect vacation, but we really do feel like we've got it right. And we continue to focus on delivering excellent guest experiences. It's somewhat of an obsession within the team. And of course, more recently, Celebrity announced that they're also sailing to Perfect Day. So that's great for the Celebrity brand as well. So we see it as a great success, and we continue to refine it and to develop it, and we continue to plan to bring our guests to Perfect Day.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossAnd congrats on another nice quarter. So maybe to elaborate on the acceleration in trends that you're seeing in both passenger ticket and onboard spend relative to 2019, I guess how best to think about sustainability multiyear as you break down trends between new to crews that you're seeing versus existing cohorts? And are there any lead indicators at all that point to any future softening on any metrics?Steven Moyer WieczynskiYes. .Jason T. LibertyWell, thanks, Matt. Well, first, I would say that I think the acceleration that we're seeing is on a few points. One, I think we're getting more share of the wallet because we're helping better kind of curate and take friction out of the experience. And you can see that in just the volumes of guests that are -- that are willing to book directly with us online because we're able to curate the actual cruise booking, also all the things that we're doing precruise to get them to book ahead of time. And so a lot of it -- some of it is price driven, but a lot of it is just the friction that we've taken out of it and the commercial tools we put in place to make it easier for them to book those experiences. And so, I think that's a big kind of part of the acceleration. The other part, I think, of the acceleration is that we have. We really do feel that we have the best brands, the best ships, the best destinations kind of in play here. which we think is really excelling -- or accelerating the preference for the vacation experiences that we're offering to our guests. So I think that's also a very important thing. But really in everything that we've talked about today and what we said in our release in the storyline, there are no indicators of softness. There's really only indicators of acceleration in what we're seeing as we continue to have the ability to raise pricing. And when we -- of course, when we put out our guidance, it's really based off of what we're seeing today in the booking environment. And of course, we've seen a continued set of acceleration from period to period. So I think just -- I think a lot of what you're seeing is execution -- and I think a lot of what you're seeing is long-term strategies coming into play versus just kind of necessarily riding the market -- and so I think that's important. But I just want to emphasize at this point, whether it's in the booking environment, on the ticket side, whether it's on the onboard side, we don't see any indicator of weakness.I'll just add also, obviously, we made great progress on closing the gap to land-based vacation, but the value gap is still there, and we see this as a great opportunity continued to grow yields. And then just taking market share from the global leisure market, right? And you can see some of that success with new to cruise, that's really core to our strategy.Matthew Robert BossGreat. And then just on the bottom line as a follow-up. So as we think about EBITDA margins multiyear and just looking back at prior peak levels, is there any reason to consider that Trifecta plan as a ceiling? Or just any unlocks to consider, which would point to this model as accretive relative to pre-pandemic profitability levels?Naftali HoltzYes. So as you know, Trifecta for us, as Jason said, was base camp. And if you kind of look at the the triple EBITDA per APCD -- triple-digit EBITDA per APCD, which obviously is at least 100. It does have a margin expansion beyond 2019, but as we continue to grow that, we see a lot of opportunities on multiple levels, right, growing yields, lower acquisition costs, just scaling the business as we grow and our ambitions are above 2019 levels, that's for sure.Jason T. LibertyYes. But I would just add, there is nothing structural that I'd say puts that at risk. I think what we need to focus on, and we know this about our business model is moderate yield growth which I would not, again, call this year moderate, but moderate yield growth, good cost control leads to expanded margins as we grow our business. Every 1% change in our yield is $110 million plus and a 1% change in our cost is about $50 million. So grow your yields faster than you grow your costs and you're going to continue to expand your margins.OperatorI will now turn the call back over to Naftali Holtz, CFO, for closing remarks.Naftali HoltzWell, thank you, everyone, for your participation and interest in the company. Michael will be available for any follow-ups. We wish you all a great day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations drifting higher.As shown below, the revisions trend has been robust across multiple timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s valuation is attractive, with the current 18.9X forward earnings multiple sitting nowhere near the steep 45.5X five-year median and highs of 66.9X in 2022. The stock carries a Style Score of “B” for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd it’s impossible to ignore the company’s growth expectations, with earnings forecasted to soar 115% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 20% in FY24.

Regulators say the increase would primarily affect the largest banks and that most have enough capital already to comply. Capital is the buffer banks have to hold to absorb future losses.Regulators also proposed changes in how these banks assess risks and widened the scope of the new rules to institutions with as few as $100 billion in assets, meaning roughly 30 banks would be subject to the same calculations.That would include giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as midsized regional banks such as Fifth Third (FITB) and Regions (RF).The impact will differ from bank to bank depending on their operations. Agency officials said the eight largest banks that have huge trading desks and coast-to-coast franchises, such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, will see capital requirements rise by 19% on average.The smaller banks with $100-$250 million in assets will see an average rise of 5%. A number of mid-sized regional banks fall in this category, including KeyCorp (KEY) and Huntington (HBAN).Officials argue the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered deposit withdrawals across the banking world.""Recent events demonstrated the effects that stress at a few large, regional banking organizations could have on the stability, public confidence, and trust in the banking system,"" said acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu.Regulators will accept comments on this proposal through Nov. 30. Some parts of the proposal would be phased in over three years, starting in July 2025. All rules would be in place by July 2028.Story continuesMichael J. Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency. (Mariam Zuhaib/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Some doubts within the FedThe proposal followed a nine-month-long review conducted by Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr.Fed Chair Jay Powell supported putting this new capital proposal out for comment but said in a statement released Thursday that regulators need to weigh the costs of capital increases overall and for specific areas, including capital markets and operational risk.""While there could be benefits of still higher capital, as always we must also consider the potential costs,"" he said, noting that the proposal is tougher than international standards, and could lead to a decline in liquidity for capital markets and push activities into the shadow banking system.""This is a difficult balance to strike, and striking it will require public input and thoughtful deliberation.""Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, issued separate statements that were critical of the proposal.Waller said he voted against releasing it for public comment, stating that some elements are already accounted for in annual Fed stress tests and that the new standards could put US banks at a disadvantage when competing with international rivals.Waller also wrote that the proposal could cause lenders to push higher capital costs on consumers and potentially narrow the scope of US banking activities.Read more: How to get a personal loan with bad creditFed governor Christopher Waller said he voted against the new bank capital proposal. (Patrick Semansky/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""I am not convinced that it improves the resiliency of the financial system,"" he added. ""At the same time, it will increase costs for families and businesses and could impede market functioning. I don’t think those costs are worth bearing without clear benefits to the resiliency of the financial system.""Bowman, who also voted against components of the new rules, said she believes the proposed higher capital levels would hurt lending and liquidity in markets and that they wouldn’t have addressed the problems that contributed to the regional bank failures earlier this year.Her concern is that the new rules will force smaller banks to merge, harming competition, and would prefer to address any risk management issues through better regulatory supervision and enforcement actions when necessary.""While there is more to learn about the recent bank failures, it seems apparent that these failures were caused primarily by poor risk management and deficient supervision, not by a lack of capital,"" she said.Bank pushbackThe proposed changes unveiled Thursday are part of the US version of an international accord known as Basel III that was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and follow a nine-month-long review conducted by Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr.The goal of the Basel committee — which was convened by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland — was to set global regulatory capital standards so that banks would have enough in reserve to survive crises.The last version of this accord was agreed to in 2017, but plans to roll it out in the US were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The new capital proposals are expected to face pushback from the banking industry, which argues that lenders are much more resilient than they were during the 2008 financial crisis and that higher requirements could restrict lending.""As you raise capital requirements, it makes loans and capital markets more expensive, and that’s permanent,"" Greg Baer, president of the Bank Policy Institute, told Yahoo Finance. ""It becomes a permanent loss to the economy.""American Bankers Association CEO Rob Nichols said in a statement that the rules ""fail to appreciate the negative economic consequences that come with forcing already strong banks to hold more capital than what is needed to maintain safety and soundness.""Financial Services Forum CEO Kevin Fromer added that ""there is no justification for significant increases in capital at the largest US banks.""Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Regulatory agency officials said the increases overall were modest and would be offset by the benefits of having a more resilient banking system.'Risk weights' and paper lossesA key component of these new rules will be higher ""risk weights"" applied to certain assets banks hold.The riskier the assets are, the higher the weights and the more capital banks will be required to set aside to absorb any future losses.These assets can range from Treasuries and mortgages to derivatives and cryptocurrencies.Another important change is how banks assess future risks. Banks will no longer be able to rely on internal models to estimate how much they could lose on loans — and therefore how much capital should be held against assets such as mortgages.The fear from regulators is that the internal bank models can underestimate these risks. Instead, regulators will impose uniform standards.Regulators are also concerned about how banks evaluate the risks from market swings, trading losses, and unexpected operational developments such as litigation.Thus banks would have to model market risks at the level of individual trading desks for particular asset classes, instead of at the firm level. They can continue to use their own internal models for that evaluation.Banks with big trading desks could see higher capital requirements, as a result.Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr led the review of bank capital rules. (Mariam Zuhaib/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)As for unexpected operational events, such as litigation expenses, banks would have to use a standardized approach provided by regulators.Banks worry this will punish lenders that rely on non-interest fee income, such as credit card or wealth management fees, because regulators consider those sources of potential operational risk if internal controls were to break down.Another big change announced Thursday is that banks with $100 billion in assets or more would have to count any unrealized available-for-sale securities losses against their regulatory capital.That last rule would reverse a policy put in place last decade when US supervisors decided most small and mid-sized institutions could opt out of deducting these paper losses on bonds from key regulatory capital levels.In essence, these banks were allowed to report assets that were stronger in theory than they would be in practice.As Silicon Valley Bank — and the broader investing public — found out in March.Banks with $100 billion or more in assets will also have to comply with two other requirements that were previously applied to larger banks: a supplementary leverage ratio and a countercyclical capital buffer.Agency officials said another way to look at all of the changes unveiled Thursday is that the banks that have to comply will be asked to hold an additional 2 percentage points of capital.They said that most banks have enough capital now but those that don't would be able to build the required amounts in two years.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The national rollout will span 11 metropolitan areas throughout the continental United States and is expected to train up to 150 survivors by July 2024.University of Maryland Support, Advocacy, Freedom, and Empowerment Center for Human Trafficking Survivors (the SAFE Center)Recognizing that trafficking survivors face many barriers in their search for education and employment, Marriott co-developed the FiT Curriculum in collaboration with the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery (GFEMS) in 2018. Designed with input from survivor consultants and field experts, the FiT Curriculum provides trauma-informed job readiness training for survivors interested in hospitality careers. The training program consists of seven modules that focus on hospitality and teach foundational knowledge useful in any industry, including presentation skills, teamwork, time management, relationship building, and interviewing basics.""Marriott has a longstanding commitment to empower through opportunity and create pathways to career growth,"" said Anthony Capuano, President and Chief Executive Officer, Marriott International. ""We are proud to expand our commitment to survivors of human trafficking and deepen our anti-trafficking efforts. This curriculum helps fill a market-based need for trained talent and offers survivors access to skills-based training and meaningful careers in the hospitality industry. We look forward to expanding our support to the SAFE Center for Human Trafficking Survivors as it scales the FiT Curriculum nationwide.""The initiative builds on Marriott and GFEMS's successful pilot of the FiT Curriculum implemented by the SAFE Center for Human Trafficking and three other service providers in Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; and New York, New York in 2022. More than 60 survivors were trained in the pilot and post-curriculum survey responses indicated an increase in knowledge of all topics, confidence in skills and abilities, and a 97% satisfaction rate with the pace and content.Story continuesBuilding on the pilot's success, the SAFE Center for Human Trafficking Survivors was awarded an inaugural grant from the AHLA Foundation's No Room for Trafficking (NRFT) Survivor Fund to grow the FiT Curriculum across the country. Marriott International is a proud donor to the NRFT Survivor Fund, which provides grants to community-based organizations working to provide financial support and stability to survivors. Jointly with The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation, Marriott made a combined contribution of $550,000 to the fund in June of 2023To scale the program nationally, the SAFE Center for Human Trafficking Survivors will use a Train-the-Trainer model to onboard 10 additional sites to deploy the FiT Curriculum in person and/or by virtual instruction. The content will be delivered by local facilitators to structure the program based on the needs of the survivors they serve. All English and Spanish-speaking adult survivors receiving services from the SAFE Center for Human Trafficking Survivors and subcontracted partner organizations will be eligible to participate in the training program.""We have seen the profound effect hospitality training can have on survivors' wellbeing and autonomy,"" said Susan Esserman, SAFE Center Founder and Director. ""The American Hotel and Lodging Association award provides an opportunity to scale the impact of the hospitality training program to human trafficking survivors across the country. We are immensely grateful to Marriott International for their innovative leadership in developing hospitality training for survivors and their commitment to empower survivors by offering vital employment opportunities that advance economic empowerment and financial stability for survivors and their families.""Marriott introduced human trafficking awareness training – developed in consultation with PACT (previously known as ECPAT-USA) and Polaris – for its associates in 2016. Last year, Marriott marked an important milestone toward its goal of training all on-property associates in human trafficking awareness by 2025 as part of its sustainability and social impact platform, Serve 360. Over 1.1 million Marriott associates are now trained to spot the signs and respond to human trafficking.As of 2023, more than 900,000 hospitality professionals outside of Marriott have also completed the donated version of the training.

in this press release is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, KLA's financial results presented in accordance with United States GAAP.To supplement our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP financial information, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain gains, costs and expenses, as well as other supplemental information. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our operating performance and our prospects in the future. Specifically, we believe that the non-GAAP information, including non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA, non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to KLA, non-GAAP gross margin and free cash flow, provides useful measures to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial performance by excluding certain costs and expenses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results to help investors compare our operating performances with our results in prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies. The non-GAAP information is among the budgeting and planning tools that management uses for future forecasting. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics are inherently subject to significant discretion (for example, determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric). As a result, non-GAAP financial metrics may be defined very differently from company to company, or even from period to period within the same company, which can potentially limit the usefulness of such information to an investor. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP. The following are descriptions of the adjustments made to reconcile GAAP net income attributable to KLA to non-GAAP net income attributable to KLA:a.Acquisition-related charges primarily include amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with our acquisitions and dispositions, as well as intangible asset impairment charges.b. Restructuring, severance and other charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance including associated acceleration of recognition of certain stock-based and other compensation expenses, gains and losses from exiting non-core businesses, interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits, charges related to liquidation of legal entities and adjustments related to non-controlling interest. Restructuring, severance and other charges in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 include a gain on the sale of Orbograph, Ltd. (""Orbograph""), which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by certain transaction bonuses triggered by the sale of Orbograph.c.  Loss on extinguishment of debt includes a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of the $500 million 4.650% Senior Notes due in November 2024.d.  Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes the income tax effects of the excluded items noted above.e.Discrete tax items in all periods presented include a tax impact relating to the amortization of certain intellectual property as a result of an internal restructuring of ownership rights to align with how our business operates. Discrete tax items in the three months ended June 30, 2022 include an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Discrete items in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 include a tax expense of $19.8 million from an internal restructuring and an adjustment of the net benefit of the Orbotech Ltd. 2012 to 2018 Israel tax audit settlement, for which the net benefit includes the liability on the audit settlement less reductions in unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Discrete tax items in the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 also include a tax impact from the sale of Orbograph. Discrete tax items in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 primarily include the aggregate of the aforementioned discrete tax items as well as a one-time tax benefit of $394.5 million resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates and a net benefit of $69.2 million from an internal restructuring, partially offset by a tax expense of $163.7 million from an increase in deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings due to a change in tax law. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kla-corporation-reports-fiscal-2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-301887012.htmlSOURCE KLA Corporation]"

This assessment is based on its market cap of $67.2 billion and sales of $10.6 billion.KLA Corp (KLAC): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Semiconductor IndustryGF Value of KLAThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value. This is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GuruFocus Value calculation, KLA's stock appears to be fairly valued. This estimation is based on the historical multiples at which the stock has traded, past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Given that KLA is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.KLA Corp (KLAC): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Semiconductor IndustryLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of KLAInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Hence, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. KLA has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.48, which ranks worse than 78.74% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks KLA's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Story continuesKLA Corp (KLAC): A Fairly Valued Stock in the Semiconductor IndustryProfitability and Growth of KLAInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. KLA has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $10.6 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $24.52. Its operating margin is 39%, which ranks better than 96.69% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, the profitability of KLA is ranked 9 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.Jud HenryWelcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.Story continuesG. Michael SievertOkay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. As you can see, we're here with several members of our senior management team. We're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington, and we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me share just a few comments. If you'll recall at our Analyst Day in early 2021, we shared our strategy to build the best network couple it with a leading Un-carrier value proposition and customer experience and grow our share in areas where T-Mobile was massively underpenetrated relative to our peers.That strategy and our approach has remained remarkably consistent and our Q2 results continue to show that it's working better than ever. In fact, T-Mobile delivered our highest Q2 postpaid phone net adds in 8 years, fueled by both industry-leading gross adds and the lowest postpaid phone churn in company history.And importantly, we did this while industry growth normalized, proving that the growth opportunities and durable advantages we've been sharing with you really are unique to T-Mobile. We also told you that if we delivered the best product and the best value and the best experiences, there was no reason we couldn't get to the lowest churn in the industry. Remember that.And in Q2, we did it. For the first time in our history, T-Mobile reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry. That is a remarkable statement, and it's a testament to the work our team has done to build the best network. And to further our value proposition to deliver even better experiences to customers. Now I'm sure there's still going to be some back and forth between us and the other guys before we consistently put them in the rearview mirror for good on churn, but all the same.It is great to get this first win. We also continue to run the business in a smart and sustainable manner, translating our industry-leading customer growth in Q2 into industry-leading service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth while growing free cash flow by more than 60% year-over-year. This industry-leading customer and financial growth led us to raise guidance for the year again.And we're fortunate to deliver these industry-leading results within the context of a vibrant wireless industry, with growing industry service revenues and industry cash flows and healthy competition that continues to deliver more value and better networks to customers. In fact, on network, we not only defended, but extended our leadership in both overall and 5G performance. With the latest third-party reports showing that T-Mobile's lead is widening.Looking at Ookla data, T-Mobile once again swept every category for overall network performance with median download speeds, more than double our closest competitor. We've long talked about our dedicated 5G spectrum assets with superior propagation would result in a demonstrable advantage in customers' everyday lived experiences even as the competitors try to catch us.T-Mobile's head start, our dedicated 5G spectrum assets and our technology leadership are the things that allow us to stay meaningfully ahead as in like 2 years or more ahead in 5G reach and overall network performance and to stay ahead for years to come. And the most exciting part is that many prospective customers are only just beginning to notice, which means lots of the benefit from this is in front of us. And importantly, these things also allow it to do it all with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Now we also continue to build on our fame for providing the best value. Our latest Un-carrier move, Phone Freedom, frees customers locked up into those 3-year contracts at the carriers. And our new Go5G Plus rate plan delivers the best value in wireless.The response from customers has been really amazing. In fact, Go5G Plus instantly became our most popular plan, and we're seeing improved porting ratios against every competitor including yet another quarter of year-over-year improvement against cable. In fact, total postpaid porting ratios for us have improved every month since we launched Phone Freedom including in July. As more and more customers learn that they can break free from those 3-year contracts come to a better network and get a better value at T-Mobile. All of these catalysts, coupled with our unique growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets, are what enable a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition and you're seeing it again in these Q2 results. We added 299,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest reported in the industry showing that we continue to win the switching decisions in the market.And we had postpaid net additions of 1.6 million again leading the industry by a wide margin. This included postpaid phone net adds of 760,000, our highest Q2 in 8 years, even as the industry sees more normalized levels of growth. Our increased share was driven by our industry best phone gross adds, which grew over last year's Q2 as well as the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history. And as I mentioned, the lowest in the industry for the first time ever at just 0.77%.In T-Mobile for Business, we had a record quarter with best ever phone net adds and our lowest-ever phone churn. Enterprise and government customers buy based on their own rigorous testing of the networks, not just price, and our network leadership, innovative solutions and customer experiences are driving major wins and fueling our momentum in these segments. We're attracting profitable customers with CLVs in the hundreds of dollars each and still growing. As I mentioned, consumers are beginning to take notice of our network strides as well, as we're winning prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. We saw our share of switchers in the top 100 markets increase both sequentially and year-over-year. In smaller markets and rural areas, where we continue to bring the first and in many places, only 5G network, we're seeing an incredible response. We're capturing a win share of switchers in these areas in the upper 30s, which shows we're not only on track to meet our goal of 20% share in 2025, but it gives us confidence we have room to run in the years beyond. In addition to mobile wireless, we added 509,000 high-speed internet customers.Notably, we've continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched over 2 years ago as demand for the product just continues to grow. And we saw a sequential improvement in churn again this quarter and Net Promoter Scores that remain multiples higher than cable, demonstrating how our high-speed internet resonates with and satisfies an important target audience within this larger broadband market. We also celebrated another major milestone in our Sprint merger integration as we are now substantially complete with both the billing migration and retail rationalization, well ahead of our year-end target. At every step of our integration journey, the customer has been our primary focus.As you know, this has allowed us to not only unlock synergies bigger and faster than expected, but also to deliver industry-leading growth and record low churn at the same time. I could not be more proud of what our team has accomplished in this area. Okay. I'm going to wrap it up. We are pulling into the station halfway 2023 with great momentum. Our postpaid phone net adds year-to-date are right on track with last year, which was a growth record year for us. We continue to extend our durable network and value leadership over the competition, which fuels our growth opportunities. And our profitable growth strategy continues to translate into the highest core adjusted EBITDA growth and year-to-date cash flow conversion in the industry. Listen, in our industry, change is a constant, but our team navigates it definitely with the customer as our North Star. And because of that, there has never been a more exciting time to be at T-Mobile.Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance for 2023.Peter OsvaldikAbsolutely. Thanks, Mike. Q2 was another quarter of best-in-class profitable growth, which underpins the updated guidance that I'll share with you in a moment. It starts with the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 5% year-over-year driven by continued increases in both postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in an 11% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA, and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points year-over-year.In addition, free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year and with the highest free cash flow to service revenue margin relative to our peers year-to-date. We expect this to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 25.2 million shares for $3.5 billion in Q2 with a cumulative total of 83.5 million shares repurchased for $11.8 billion as of July 21.All right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 million and 5.9 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities, and we continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year.Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $28.9 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger-related costs of $1.6 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&amp;L recognition to date.Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $18 billion to $18.3 billion, and we now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion delivering a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry, unlocked by our network leadership. We expect CapEx to taper in Q3 and then further in Q4.The slightly higher operating cash flows fund the increased CapEx resulting in strong free cash flow of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year.We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than the 1% we had previously guided for 2023 as we continue to expand our account relationships across products and services as part of our land-and-expand account strategy to grow service revenue. Before I wrap up, I want to remind folks that we closed the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent on May 1, which had a partial impact on our results in Q2, and we expect the full run rate impact beginning in Q3 as I laid out last quarter. In closing, we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities to deliver the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry and unlock shareholder value.And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&amp;A. Jud?Question and Answer SessionJud HenryAll right. Let's get to your questions. (Operator Instructions) We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.OperatorThat will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanAnd it was great to see -- great to see the strong cash flow in the quarter. In light of that, we've gotten a few questions around why you decided to downtick a little bit on the buyback. And I guess maybe the higher level question we're getting now that you're much further into the program. How do you think about managing that program going forward? I mean cash flow is obviously an input. You're going to be making some payments for C-band spectrum this year. So what's the right way for investors to kind of frame your expectations around how you're going to manage that on a go-forward basis.G. Michael SievertSounds great. Thanks, Brett. I'll start and then maybe hand it to Peter for some comments. The way I think about it is we're buying at a pace through -- mostly through predesigned 10b5-1 programs in order to be able to meet the authorization during the time frame of the authorization.So if you recall, the initial authorization of this program, it's a $14 billion program that takes us through September. And if you look at some of our activity early in the year where we were able to grab some additional run rate. Now the remaining funds relative to the remaining time suggests a run rate where we have it. So it's not really a downtick so much as just kind of a programmatic view. And then -- and maybe Peter can pile in on the second part. The way we think about it broadly is that there's essentially been no underlying change to the thesis we've been communicating all along. Now our Board hasn't made a determination yet about the second step, but the inputs to those steps have to do with the free cash flow development of this company, which, as you mentioned in the premise of your question is right on track.We're guiding to 75% year-over-year cash flow growth this year. And the underpinnings of the growth in the business, as you saw from our fantastic Q2 momentum suggest another good year in '24. And so -- as the cash flow develops, that's what gives us the confidence that, that original thesis of around $60 billion through 2025 is intact.But maybe you can also comment, Peter, on kind of how we think about this from a dedication of resources to this versus spectrum and other things as Brett asked.Peter OsvaldikAbsolutely, Brett. One of the things that we had underpinned at Analyst Day is that it's about up to $65 billion of free cash flow that's going to support the $60 billion of potential shareholder remuneration. And within that, we had some room and had reserved some capacity for spectrum purchases and other things.And of course, we'll fundamentally continue throughout this whole period, one, to deliver because the underlying delivery of the free cash flow is what allows everything to happen. And, of course, always look at opportunities before us for the highest value creation opportunity. With your question on C-band, that was already included in our assumption here. So when we continue to say, we have optimism around the program in totality, C-band is fully contemplated within that.Brett Joseph FeldmanThat's great color. If I can ask a quick follow-up question as we're talking about overall liquidity. Any update on the spectrum option that DISH hold? And if that were to get exercised, how do you think about putting that proceeds to work?G. Michael SievertSure. Well, the first thing I would point out is that any proceeds from that have not been contemplated in the long-range cash planning. So if there's cash that comes from that soon, that be incremental to the planning expectations. We're still awaiting DISH's decision. So just as an update, and I think our filings made some of this clear. The deadline has come and gone for them to determine whether or not they would exercise their privilege to buy that spectrum for $3.6 billion.But they asked for some additional time of the DOJ, and we did not object to that. And so we have committed that we would not terminate their agreement and right to do that at any time before August 11. But in fact, we're in discussions with DISH about whether or not there might be a win-win that's different from their initial privilege. And if there is that would be wonderful. But obviously, that deadline is coming. So -- but our view was it was worth taking the extra time, especially since they asked for it in case there's a bigger win-win to be had here.OperatorThat will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.Craig Eder MoffettTwo questions. One, as long as we're on the topic of DISH. Outside of the 800, if the opportunity came up, would you have an appetite for more mid-band spectrum, either from DISH or perhaps any other source. And we're talking about sort of meaningful size chunks here. And then second, if you could just talk about the pacing and trajectory of fixed wireless, as you now with a little more experience under your belt, as you look out toward your long-term guidance, how do you think about the pacing to get to 8 million or so households?G. Michael SievertSounds great. Well, I'll tackle the first one and then maybe hand to Mike Katz for the second one. And I don't mean to be flip, Craig, but I think you've been following us for so long. You know we've never met spectrum, we didn't like. And so of course. And -- but one thing that distinguishes us from other providers is that when we get our hands on spectrum, we put it to work right away for the benefit of the American consumer. And so that's not only in the public interest, but that's in the interest of T-Mobile and our customers. And so you see that in how we're deploying so ambitiously the 2.5 gigahertz that are the proceeds of the merger, having built the best 5G network in history on that spectrum acquisition that came through the merger.So look, I mean, we're always on the hunt for other ways to add capacity to our network because it allows us to do amazing things like not only continue to take share and grow and meet ever rising needs of customers on their smartphones, but also to get after the subject of your second question, which is fixed wireless access. And -- to the first part of your second question, nothing has changed in our aspiration. We're still on the hunt for that single-digit penetration. And maybe Mike could comment about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the rate and pace of our growth versus our expectations.Michael J. KatzYes. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Craig, for the question. We couldn't be happier with what's going on with this HSI business. You probably saw from all of our results, we just crossed over 3.7 million customers in this business. And this pacing that we're on, which we told you last quarter and the quarter before, right around where we were in Q2, right around 500,000 customers, we -- it gives us confidence that the 7 million to 8 million total customers that we committed to at the end of this planning period that we've got high confidence that we're going to get there. One of the things that Mike mentioned in his comments that I think is worth reiterating is, we saw in Q2 again, our highest gross adds. And our gross adds have increased every single quarter since we launched this product.And then again, in Q2, we saw sequential decreases in churn. And I think that really speaks to the fact that this is a great product. It's a great product that customers are really, really loving. And you see that both in this sequential churn decrease, but also just in the overall NPS scores, which continue to be the highest amongst any broadband category in America. So we're really thrilled with where we are with this product.G. Michael SievertBack to my comments, upfront, I said things have been remarkably consistent with what we rolled out to you at our Analyst Day in '21. This is one of those things.We said we saw a potential here of 7 million to 8 million subscribers based on the excess capacity profile of our built mobile network. That means it's not capital burdened. And because of that, we can make profit there. And so it plays a role. It's a single-digit penetration role, and we're on our way to going and seizing it for the benefit of our shareholders and our customers, and it's right on track.OperatorThat will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.Jonathan ChaplinWonder if you can give us context on a couple of things. So firstly, how are you thinking about the evolution of upgrades in the second half of the year as we go through a new iPhone cycle? And kind of what have you factored into your guidance on EBITDA for that? It looks like upgrades to the industry have been coming in sort of lower than expected, much lower than historical trends.I'm wondering how that shifts in the second half of the year. And then wondering if you can give us a little bit more context on fixed wireless broadband churn. You mentioned that it's come down sequentially, which isn't surprising in that it's always lower in the broadband market in the second quarter. But what does it look like on a year-over-year basis? Maybe you can give us some context around the kind of levels that it's at for the mature portion of the base that's been with you maybe for a year or more.G. Michael SievertYes, Jonathan, you're spot on in the premise of the question that looking at the aging of the base is the way to get at it. We'll come to Mike on that in a minute. But first, on upgrades, historically low upgrades, Peter, what's contemplated for the rest of the year and maybe a little commentary on why do we think we're seeing that.Peter OsvaldikYes. Well, let me start with why do we think we're seeing that. And fundamentally, we believe we're meeting customers' needs and desires. And if you look at what we've talked about from a network perspective and a value perspective, it makes a lot of sense. You come onto this network, and you have a 5G device. Remember, about 2/3 of our postpaid base already has a 5G device. And they get experience on this network that is just phenomenal in the broadest sense of the word, much more than the competitive sense can bring.And we think that we're just meeting their natural demand. Customers are happy with their devices. They're happy with their devices from a longer perspective, Remember, we continue to have 2-year financing constructs, so they have the ability to upgrade earlier than the competition, one of the unlocks of Phone Freedom that we put out there that led to the port ratio changes. So fundamentally, we think we're exactly meeting what customers need. In regards to the second half, the second half always tends to have slightly higher upgrade rates. And you mentioned that you have new product introduction from Apple.You tend to have promotional constructs and a little bit higher switching in the second half, and we're typically the beneficiary of that. We also obviously make very, very solid offers to our base from an upgrade perspective. So we do have higher upgrade rates contemplated than what we saw in Q2, but we don't specifically guide to those other than directionally.G. Michael SievertOkay. And Mike, over to you on a little bit more color on high-speed internet churn.Michael J. KatzYes. I mean I think building on what you're saying, Mike, what -- we have the youngest base of broadband customers in America. And like I think we said in a couple of calls, the churn curves that we see for customers like in our mobile business tends to be higher in the earlier 10-year months and then reduces as customers achieve greater tenure lengths with us.And we're seeing the exact same thing in our broadband business. And customers that have been with us for some months, their churn has decreased to the point that was right where we expected it. So it's looking right on where our plan was, and the behavior has been just right in line with what we expected.G. Michael SievertOkay. Terrific. And maybe, Jud, tell us when it's time to go to Twitter. So that we're not ignoring the people coming in on Twitter because we always do some of that as well. And -- but while you're thinking about it, we'll go operator to one more online.OperatorThat will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.John Christopher HodulikTwo questions, if I could. First, on margins. Obviously, a lot of progress there at 300 basis points, but you guys still trail AT&amp;T and Verizon by about 500 basis points. And do you see that closing over time? Or is it really just a function of those sort of lower ARPU and in fact our sub growth? That's number one. And number two, Mike, I think you said that your porting versus cable has improved. And I don't think you've called that out before. But maybe just some commentary about what you're seeing in terms of competition in wireless and cable. I mean, they're talking about sort of more and more bundled offerings. And I guess Comcast was sort of flattish on a year-over-year basis, but just what the posture is there and what's driving that improvement in porting from cable?G. Michael SievertOkay. I'll take that one, but Peter, we'll start with you.Peter OsvaldikYes. Certainly, on the margin question, it's a lot more than an ARPU differential. It's really some structural differences that we always call out. For example, the whole leased versus owned backhaul strategy. The other thing that always note is that with this significant higher switching that we see and the net add production that we're giving, obviously, we have more S in SG&amp;A than the competition does. We have a very dense network built out.So there's fundamental some structural differences that also mean there's a CapEx OpEx differential and when you compare AT&amp;T and Verizon and us. And that's why it's always important to fundamentally look at conversion of service revenue into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the value generation engine that allows you to further invest, return capital to shareholders or do all sorts of other things to create value.And that is the measure by which we're really comparing ourselves to the competition to get rid of all the structural noise. And on that regard, you heard what we announced today already there from a year-to-date basis in terms of beating them on the conversion ratio when next year anticipated to expand that ratio further. So that's how I think about margins.G. Michael SievertIt's interesting that when you listen to a few of that and you hear that even with our superior growth and our lower prices, both of which hit margins, we have the superior cash production per service revenue dollar in the industry year-to-date and that's rapidly expanding. 75% year-over-year guide, this year, on our way to higher cash flows next year. And so it really shows you the power of this model based on this team's ability to execute, but also based on the balance sheet, the incredible assets that we control, the track record of execution, the head start and many other benefits.Okay. Great. The second one was -- oh, second one was cable. So John, let me come back to that. Yes, we did make a very light comment on it, but it was light that we had been seeing improvements in our port ratios with cable last quarter because we wanted to provide some commentary because cable and Q4 started to see some pretty big net add trajectory changes.And so we kind of double clicked into that. Because you kind of have to do that as a competitor to figure out -- is this going to come from us or what's going on. And it's kind of interesting, you fast forward to this quarter. And I'll remind you that even in a world where cable is now a pretty big share taker in overall postpaid, T-Mobile produced the highest postpaid phone net additions for Q2 in 8 years and not only the lowest churn ever in our history, but the lowest in the industry.And that kind of answers a question as to whether or not this dynamic from cable is coming from our side, right? I mean we're performing better than before they were in the industry. But obviously, there's a dynamic that affects others, both of our 2 look-a-like competitors, plus prepaid. There's a lot of brands that have been affected by this, and they're viable competitors to be taken seriously. But it's just, as you can see in our performance, not affecting our results.Okay. Jud, who do we -- what do we have coming in online?Jud HenryWe've got a question from Roger Entner on how strong was the business growth this quarter. Maybe we can anti that one up. And then we've got a follow-on question around enterprise sector as well so we can hit those.G. Michael SievertOkay. Great. So Roger Entner asked how strong was business growth this quarter. Can you talk about the VA? And any additional color on overall business growth. We also have Chetan Sharma coming in. Congrats on another great quarter. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on traction you're seeing in the enterprise sector beyond connectivity.What about vertical industries, people using 5G, 5G advanced services, et cetera. So maybe, Callie, why don't you start on both of those and anybody else can jump in.Callie R. FieldOkay. Thanks, Mike. And thanks, Roger, and Chetan for the questions. As Mike mentioned earlier, we delivered on our highest phone net adds and lowest phone churn ever, handily being Verizon again. And we're seeing profitable growth in all 3 segments. In SMB, we achieved positive port trends against AT&amp;T and this makes 5 consecutive quarters against Verizon, and we grew ARPU quarter-over-quarter again. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, in enterprise and in government, our business is good business with very profitable CLVs, but roughly 60% to 70% relative to consumer, and they're rising year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter.And Q2 for enterprise, for instance, we welcomed both the largest global asset management firm and yet another leading global bank as new accounts. We also landed 2 huge government contracts with the EPA and the IRS and continue to double our net adds quarter-over-quarter with first responders, most significantly in rural areas where an older LTE network just doesn't cut it for critical response.So a lot of really good growth this quarter from an incredible team in the business group. And then for the VA question, if I could just take that one for a second. I wanted to say, as you may remember, we took Verizon share back in 2018.And now because of our network, we've taken the pole position and have added roughly 20,000 phones year-to-date supporting more than 50% of the VA phones today. And I'll note to our contract also includes T-Mobile's 5G internet for the VAs community-based outpatient clinics. So we're able to provide health care for veterans in rural areas because of the network that we have built. So just wanted to add some clarity on the VA subject. And then one last thing on use cases for 5G applications outside of pure connectivity.I'll start, Chetan, with some of the verticals where we're seeing the most traction. And that would be in retail, where we see many use cases for fixed 5G solutions where people are looking to look at better cost and less truck rolls and support for perhaps older wireline services and are replacing that with T-Mobile's 5G in multiunit national retailers.And then in health care, this is another area where we're seeing CTOs and CIOs from large hospitals come to us and say, ""Look, we need ubiquitous connectivity, both indoor and outdoor. We need more of a programmable network. We need certain places in our buildings where we want to designate private networks.""And because of our public 5G network and the solutions that we can offer with our stand-alone core, we're able to offer a hybrid solution that's really working in a place like a hospital that has lots of different variation to the types of connectivity they need. And then lastly, I'll say we're seeing some traction in education. Large campuses that want to provide connectivity for their students, but also ways to use their data differently and to get in all of the dorms and places in the campus and rooms and libraries and perhaps older buildings, where there's really a need for ubiquitous coverage throughout the campus.Those are the 3 hours that really pop out to me. The last one I would say is in the federal use cases with the Department of Defense where not a surprise to anyone, lots of areas for us to begin to deploy hybrid networks and private networks for use cases specific to the military.G. Michael SievertWell, hopefully, that answers it and more. I mean if you listen to Callie, it just reinforces what I said in my upfront remarks, which is some of the biggest and most sophisticated and profitable customers are choosing T-Mobile because of the sophistication of our advanced network capabilities and our ability to translate that into solutions for their business.And that's just so different from where we were a few years ago. It's a complete 180 and it's fueling momentum. In fact, all-time record results in our business group. So hopefully, that answers the question, guys. Terrific. Should we go back to the phones?Jud HenryLet's do it. Operator next question, please.OperatorThat will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickMike, the wireless industry is still running maybe hotter than many expected at the beginning of the year. Certainly, your momentum is strong. Are you seeing improving porting ratios versus other MNOs and maybe the MVNOs? Or do you think there's a growing mix of customers who are coming in without a phone history or a number? And then second, if I can, CapEx, Mike, you talked about tapering in the second half. Does that jumping off rate in the fourth quarter indicate a much lower '24 CapEx level?G. Michael SievertOkay. Great. I'm going to let Peter answer the second CapEx question. The first one is really interesting. The answer to the question is yes and yes. Both are true. So yes, our port ratios are improving each and every month since we launched Phone Freedom against each and every competitor, including cable overall and cable individually. And that's a really interesting fact that it shows that not only are people starting to discover our network advantages, which has sort of been a slow improvement over the last 1.5 years. But we have really sparked intrigue with consumers around this idea that we can free them from being trapped with the other guys.And cable in some ways, actually is helpful in that -- in a dynamic competitive industry, more people are jump balls. And more people are saying, ""Should I be with 1 of those 2 look-a-like kind of old line providers? Or should I be with somebody new? And when they get asked that question, they are picking cable by and large. They're picking T-Mobile, as you saw we had the industry-leading postpaid phone net additions. Now what is happening is cable is growing very rapidly and faster than I think a lot of people expected. But specifically to your premise of your question, our port ratios with cable have been improving for year-over-year for 9 quarters in a row. And what you see is that the big step forward they started to take in Q4, according to our analysis, about 80% of the year-over-year increment in their performance from the same period a year ago, Q4, Q1 and Q2 is from non-ports.So they're actually not growing the porting side of their business at the same rate as the non-porting side of their business, instead kind of printing postpaid ads. They might be coming over from prepaid. They might be just simply net new. They might be kind of dropped in the bag.I don't really know. There's probably several different factors to it. And we just -- we don't know quite how to unpack it because we don't have all the information. I mean, we double-click into things like Verizon's wholesale revenue and note that it's not growing. That's sort of an interesting diagnostic for us that helps us understand what might be happening. So anyway, hopefully, that helps it. Our industry-leading account growth of 299,000 shows that T-Mobile is winning the switching decisions in high-quality prime paying families, the kind everybody is going for.Peter OsvaldikYes. And on CapEx, Phil, the way I think about next year, although we're not specifically guiding is we're still comfortable in the $9 billion to $10 billion range that we gave out. Remember, I wouldn't take Q4 as a jumping-off point because really, the way Ulf and team have built this is a very lean manufacturing approach to the build. One of the secrets to our capital efficiency there. And so it isn't that I take a run rate and an exit run rate and projected, but $9 billion to $10 billion feels about right for next year at this point in time.G. Michael SievertOn speaking of a lean network performance machine, I think it would be a good time to just stop and take note of what's been delivered with this incredibly capital-efficient profile that you're asking about. Ulf and team, you guys deserve incredible credit. We've now reached 285 million people with ultra-capacity 5G. This is something that neither of our competitors -- principal competitors have promised to ever do, certainly not in the next 2 years. And so we've been talking about this idea of being 2 or more years ahead in the 5G race. But if anything, it's expanding. Maybe you could share a few of the statistics of kind of where we are and also a little shadowing of where we're going.Ulf EwaldssonWell, thanks, Mike. And yes, the last quarter, we actually pulled ahead in our leadership. And 285 mid-band POPs, we're heading towards 300 by the end of this year. We have to remember that we reached 200 mid-band POPs 2 years ago in 2021. On our low band, we reached 300 2 years ago, where others are now pulling into the station. It gets harder and harder with the POPs as you grow through every 100 million POPs takes about 3x the efforts in terms of upgrading and building new towers to be able to deliver the same POP growth.So this network is just fantastic, and we are so proud of it, and we're proud to support also what Callie commented on early, 5G being capable of not only being that tremendous consumer driver, it also drives now more and more of the business inside the enterprise space, which is a dream for Oliver (inaudible), who has followed the 5G for many, many years.On top of that, we have lots of room to move ahead. We have today 255 megahertz of spectrum that is dedicated to 5G on our mid-band. And you have to remember that our low band is all dedicated to 5G. When others are talking about their coverage, they're sharing this between LTE and 5G, and we're not -- we're dedicating spectrum.The mid-band megahertz will grow to 200 megahertz dedicated to 5G by the end of the year by migrating more LTE spectrum over to 5G. And then we haven't even started on what we can use for '24 and beyond, which is our C-band. We can use our 345 auction results. We can use our 108 auction results, which is enhancing our 2.5 capabilities even more, and we have yet to refarm spectrum, for example, on AWS as well. So there is just so much more for us to run at, and I couldn't be more excited that we're extending our lead in terms of our network.G. Michael SievertWell, it's a good thing you are because we're filling it up. So what's interesting is that with 3.7 million high-speed internet customers and rapidly growing, the average speeds on our network are not just twice as fast as our competitors, but growing. We're speeding up, not slowing down on this network in terms of the average person's lived experience. And that's just phenomenal. And it's -- and we've got tons of capacity that we have not yet rolled out, which opens up more and more opportunity on our way to not only the 7 million to 8 million high-speed internet customers, but our ability to, with the best network, continue to take share from our competitors.We said at the beginning, we had a 2-plus year advantage, and we would have it for the duration of the 5G era, and you're proving us right with that work. So thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryJust following up, if I could, on that spectrum deployment. I think in the past, you've talked about rolling out fixed wireless to a majority of the U.S. Perhaps you could just help us understand where you are on coverage today with the base offer and how that should evolve over time now that you're at 285 going to 300. And I guess a related question is for Ulf. You didn't mention the millimeter wave. I know you've been looking at potentially a macro overlay product. How are you thinking about that at the moment or attacking MDUs with millimeter wave.G. Michael SievertWell, let's start with the millimeter wave question and then we can come back to the coverage on fixed wireless. I can touch on that one.Ulf EwaldssonRight. So we are actually using millimeter wave today. We have deployments that we early on started off in Manhattan, for example, in Los Angeles in some areas where we really have that extraordinary capacity need, we can use the tool of millimeter wave. Our general strategy is not based on millimeter wave. It's based on a macro strategy, which is our layered approach with our low band and our mid-band and now also deploying our PCS spectrum for 5G.But millimeter wave could also be potentially an interesting play for us when it comes to enhancing capacities that could be used, for example, for HSI. And we are working with our vendors, and we are working through our OEMs to figure out if we can make a viable economic and technical performance case out of that with them.G. Michael SievertAnd that kind of bridges to your second question. Maybe this is a good time to remind everybody how our capacity model works for fixed wireless access. Essentially, right now, we serve about the potential of about 50 million homes, but they're not in certain geographies. They're geographically dispersed all over the U.S. because the way our model works is we're selling excess capacity sector by sector.And so what we do is study every sector from every tower in our network and determine what amount of normative smartphone usage will there be over the next several years. And in areas where there's still excess capacity, we today approve applicants for home internet use. And right now, there's about 50 million home addresses, where if you were to go into our tool and apply to be our customer, we'd say, yes, out of the 145 million in the country. But what's interesting is if you and several of your neighbors all did the same, the end person would get a no because it's a dynamic model.What we're selling is excess capacity. And because of that, what we -- our modeling shows us that we will get to, as we said at the very beginning, about 7 million or 8 million households with this excess capacity model that's not burdened by capital. And since it's not burdened by capital with an already built mobile network that you need for great coverage and competitiveness, we're able to profitably build this business at very low prices.It's just a win-win for a sort of single-digit penetration part of the market. Now to the premise of your question and what Ulf was getting into, of course, we're studying whether there are ways to go beyond that initial excess capacity capital-free model, capital-free-ish model. And we haven't drawn any conclusions about that yet. I mean, we're looking hard at millimeter wave.We're looking at whether or not dedicating mid-band spectrum to HSI would make sense, whether they're nonstandard-based solutions. And we just haven't drawn any conclusions. It's not immediately obvious that there are economic ways to grow this business beyond its initial single-digit penetration. But you may see us doing trials in the marketplace as we experiment with this and try to crack the code.And so you'll hear about us trying millimeter wave things or MDU strategies or nonstandards-based solutions to see if there's a way to get after it. And you see us trialing fiber, whether or not there's a way for our team, our distribution, our brand to add value in the fiber ecosystem and I've made mention of that before. All these things are things we're doing to try to learn. And the good news is we've got some time because we'll hit this kind of initial terminal sizing of HSI, still we've got 2 more years to run. So our heads are down seeing if there's a way to crack the code on this.Peter OsvaldikAnd of course, any of the things we do there that we just talked about, a capital burden model or something with fiber or all things that would have to be accretive to our Analyst Day guidance that we put out there.OperatorThat will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.Timothy Kelly HoranJust curious, why wouldn't you be raising fixed wireless prices now? It seems like you have very, very strong demand from everything we hear out there and you kind of have somewhat limited supply. And I guess related to that, the Go5G plan, can you give us some color what that means for ARPU growth in the next couple of years?G. Michael SievertOkay. Let's start with the second one on Go5G and where is ARPU going and ARPA and all that stuff. Peter, we can start with you.Peter OsvaldikYes, absolutely. I'll let John comment on the success of Go5G Plus. But as I always say, when we think about ARPU and you saw a sequential increase of about $0.20.And we continue to believe on a year-to-year basis, ARPU will be generally stable. There's probably some potential for sequential increase again from Q2 to Q3 but since it is such a mix-driven metric, and you have to put everything into it, whether we're talking about all the benefits we see from Go5G Plus, whether we talk about the benefits we see from a segmented approach, whether it's military, 55+ and how those might be lower ARPU customers than the average that we see but are high CLV customers coming in very high-quality customers.Similarly, in business. Business, you tend to get enterprise, government, large accounts that have very, very great CLVs but would have, given the nature of the volume purchasing, lower ARPU. So all of that blends into ARPU that we see as generally stable. But it's the ARPA strategy that we have. It's the switching attracting accounts into T-Mobile and then the land-and-expand ARPA strategy, which you just saw, an exciting update to the guide from plus 1% to slightly over 1% on a year-over-year basis there. And that's really the focus point for us. But -- the question on Go5G Plus, I think, I hand it to John for a moment because it's been a phenomenal success.Jon A. FreierYes. And then I think, Peter, just to remind everybody, the Go5G Plus is really kind of a front book initiative. We're not going into the base and asking people to migrate to Go5G Plus and doing all of that within the base. It's really kind of a front book initiative. But this is going fantastic. And we had an opportunity to mention this on our Q1 earnings call back on April 27, when we launched Phone Freedom, Go5G, Go5G Plus in mid-April. And like Mike said a few moments ago, when you look at the overall porting ratios and the attractiveness of this offer, and what's happening that we've increased our porting ratios every month against every competitor and have followed that through so far in July.And over 60% of the accounts that are joining T-Mobile are now subscribing to Go5G Plus. And there's a utility that's different than Magenta MAX in terms of hotspot data that we've increased in terms of high speed, roaming in Mexico and Canada, across North America that we've increased. But the big pain point that I think Go5G Plus is solving is that new and to promise. First of all, paired with the easy unlock in helping people get out of AT&amp;T and Verizon, mostly AT&amp;T given the unlocked devices, helping people get out of that switch into T-Mobile, but this 3-year contract cycle that AT&amp;T and Verizon has.We knew this was a big insight and a big opportunity that even I underestimated how big of a pain point that is, the fact that you can basically go to law school and complete law school faster than you can complete a phone contract at AT&amp;T and Verizon. And so that's a huge pain point and the promise of Go5G Plus of being able to get in a new device, same device offer as a new customer every 2 years. It's a differentiated and unique proposition in the marketplace that's really different and is really resonating with customers.G. Michael SievertWell said. Okay. And your last question was about HSI pricing. I'll just answer it briefly. I don't normally give sort of forward-looking commentary on pricing. So I'll answer it this way instead, which is do we see ARPU and are we interested in ARPU enhancement for HSI. And the answer is yes, of course. But generally, when you look at our track record, our philosophy in the past as to how to get about that isn't to jack up people's prices, is to add value to their life, bring new services, show them increased offers and let themselves select their way up. And obviously, we're interested in that in this space.OperatorThat will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.Michael Ian RollinsJust following on the earlier comment, on some of the integration milestones that you've hit. What are the activities that are left to get to the full synergy run rate of $7.5 billion for this year's guidance, $8 billion next year? And can you unpack and maybe even size some of the opportunities for further cost efficiencies that may be embedded in your multiyear plan to drive that longer-term margin expansion.G. Michael SievertOkay. Great, Michael. Well, let's talk about where we are on synergies this year and what's left to be done. I mean on the what's left to be done front, not much the major milestones are behind us, but that doesn't mean the synergy run rates are quite there yet. So maybe you can comment on that dynamic, Peter.Peter OsvaldikYes, exactly. A few things in there. Of course, we said we have a small tail of customers to still get over and that will allow the final decommissioning of systems and things to that, whether it's front office, back office, those are the things that are kind of left to do. Certainly, from a cost perspective, there's a little bit in terms of physical decom while the sites are shut off, there's still physical decom happening. And on the synergy development, as we get from $7.5 billion to the $8 billion next year, really, the big chunk of that is avoided costs. So we'll realize the vast majority of the run rate synergies by the end of this year, which you'd naturally expect given we're saying we're substantially done. And then the shift to next year will be fundamentally those avoided site build costs.Michael Ian RollinsAnd then just one other. Can you just share how T-Mobile is looking at the role and mix of online distribution and how you're viewing the durability of customers wanting a physical retail location to buy an upgrade devices?G. Michael SievertYes, absolutely. And it kind of goes to the premise of your follow-on question, your initial follow-on question, Michael. I mean, obviously, across consumer markets generally, customers want a transaction that's fast, transparent, simple and mostly digital. And our industry has been very stubborn on that front, mostly due to the complexity of the offers across all the providers. And so that's something that we're very focused on. And I know everybody in the industry is. Our digital capabilities are rapidly improving, especially as it relates to self-service for our customers.It's incredible what's going on left to right in our company as to how we're already applying AI technologies and machine learning to speed things up, serve customers in a better way. And we can get into some examples around that. But because of emerging technologies, there's a lot of potential over the coming years to not only meet customers where they are finally in this industry because we've been kind of slow in this industry due to the complexity of our offers, but also to potentially realize some efficiencies over time. And that's a good thing because the cost of competition is high. And as you've seen over the last few years, it's gone up. And so it's all about us seizing opportunities to be able to continue this formula that works so well. And for us to continue to do what we do with this flywheel of success, we can't sit on our hands. We have to be able to seize new opportunities, not necessarily to outperform the promises we made you.Those promises were really high, fulsome promises, but in some cases, to achieve them in light of what we have seen in the past, which is some increased cost of competition. So at the end of the day, it's great for consumers.OperatorThat will come from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.Richard Hamilton PrentissCouple of questions. I want to follow up on the private network question. Where do you feel that private networks -- 5G private networks will become a material enough number on the revenues, an associated question, do you feel customers, whether it's consumer or enterprise really understand what 5G means for them and why they should choose you with your head start. It just seems like the market is still just kind of like, oh, I'm not sure what 5G is.G. Michael SievertOn the consumer piece, I kind of agree and what people want is a really strong, powerful signal everywhere they go. That's what they want. And 5G is a means for us to get that better than anyone else. Whether or not they give us credit that the thing that got them that was 5G, I really don't care. But we have the highest performing network with incredible reach of the high-performing parts of our network, 5G than anybody else. Like by far, like twice the land mass covered of ultra-capacity 5G than our next closest competitor and rapidly expanding, as Ulf explained. And you're right, they don't really give 5G credit for that.But what they want, make no mistake, is a very powerful signal everywhere they go because they're watching video more than ever, they're glued to their TikTok and their Instagram stories and their sports and their YouTube and their videos and their Zooms and they don't want buffering. They want that signal with no latency and no buffering and no jitter and that's the power of 5G, whether they give it credit or not. On the Business side, I'll say the short version, which is we don't really know. I mean whether -- to your question, literally material means something in our company, and that's big. We're a big company. We don't know when it will be bigger than a bread basket, but we do know that we're best positioned to capture it. And as Peter pointed out, back at our Analyst Day, 2-plus years ago, we actually did not, for that reason, factor a lot of revenues in or really any at all from some of these advanced 5G network services.Our strategy was, let's make sure we are best positioned to capture them. And Callie, I think, very deftly explained some of the things that we're doing in this area with early adopting customers. But when it becomes something that's bigger than a bread basket and really contributes, we don't really know. And because we didn't know, we made you no promises in our long-range plan on it. But I can tell you this promise, as that market develops, we are beautifully positioned to capture it.Jud HenryAll right. It looks like we're right at time. So I appreciate everybody joining us today. If you have any further questions, please reach out to either Investor Relations or the media relations department. Again, we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you.G. Michael SievertThanks, everybody.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile First (sic) [Second] Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation.

The figure was also higher than additions posted by rivals AT&amp;T and Verizon and beat expectations of 708,800, according to Visible Alpha.But second-quarter revenue fell 2.6%, to $19.20 billion, slightly missing estimates of $19.31 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

By contrast, Verizon reported a churn of 0.83% for monthly phone subscribers, while AT&amp;T's came in at 0.79%.Excluding items, the company earned $1.86 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.69 per share.Verizon on Tuesday beat estimates for quarterly profit on the back of lower costs, while AT&amp;T expanded its cost-cutting plan by $2 billion on Wednesday, after topping estimates for quarterly free cash flow.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.17%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this manufacturer of specialized welding products and other equipment would post earnings of $2.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.13, delivering a surprise of 4.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Lincoln Electric , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, posted revenues of $1.06 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $969.59 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Lincoln Electric shares have added about 41.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Lincoln Electric?While Lincoln Electric has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lincoln Electric: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.30 on $1.07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.05 on $4.28 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products is currently in the top 49% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 1.This tool company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -121.5%.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:20% = US$4.8b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.20.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo begin with, NVIDIA seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to NVIDIA's decent 16% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 34% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about NVIDIA's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is NVIDIA Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?In NVIDIA's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1% (or a retention ratio of 93%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Moreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 1.2% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NVIDIA's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 56%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

He also expects ""far better quarters ahead for Intel and most other chipmakers"".Intel's results lifted both Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia by nearly 2.0%, while Qualcomm rose 2.2%.A titan of the American chip industry, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as Taiwan's TSMC and Nvidia both in terms of margins and market value as the PC market downturn and stiff competition in the data center market battered its business.While Intel's shares have rallied 30% this year after a tough 2022, that has paled in comparison to the more than three-fold rise in Nvidia, which became the first chipmaker with a trillion-dollar market value in May after its ""historic"" forecast.However, that was largely due to the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market, which Intel has missed out on because of its small presence in graphics-processing units and other AI specialist chips that enable the technology behind ChatGPT.Earnings reports from other chipmakers including Samsung have also shown that the glut in the smartphone and PC markets is ending, but the outlook for demand from customers outside the AI industry remains gloomy.Story continuesIntel's AI and data centers business contracted 15% in the recent quarter, and CEO Pat Gelsinger said a glut in the server central processing units market will persist until the second half of the year.He added that Intel now has enough customer orders to sell at least $1 billion worth of its AI chips through 2024.Nonetheless, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities ""don't see AI as an investable theme for Intel currently"".Intel has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.10, compared with Nvidia's 43.26 and an industry median of 19.95.(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Shounak Dasgupta)]"
307,9055f4d0-f85a-3d07-b36f-5ff04fc93758,MCK,2023-07-28,Ecolab (ECL) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecolab-ecl-report-q2-earnings-171500964.html,1690478100,STORY,"['ECL', 'MCK']","[Ecolab, Inc. ECL is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 0.9%, on average.                  Let’s see how things have shaped up for Ecolab prior to this announcement.Global IndustrialThe Global Industrial segment, comprising the Water, Food &amp; Beverage, Paper and Downstream units, witnessed a sales uptick in the first quarter of 2023. Per the company’s first-quarter earnings call in May, the water business has been performing well for the past few months. Per management, volume has been positive as it has been helping its customers to produce better and more products, while reducing their water usage. With a reduction in water usage, customers can reduce their energy usage, carbon footprint and, in turn, their costs. This will likely make them invest in Ecolab. This is likely to have significantly boosted the company’s second-quarter revenues.We estimate the second-quarter Global Industrial segment revenues to be $1.86 billion, suggesting an uptick of 9.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Ecolab Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEcolab Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEcolab Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ecolab Inc. QuoteGlobal Institutional &amp; SpecialtyEcolab’s Global Institutional &amp; Specialty segment recorded strong growth in the last reported quarter, courtesy of the company’s performance in the Institutional and Specialty divisions. The Institutional division reflected strong pricing and new business wins. Specialty sales showed robust growth on the back of strong quickservice sales growth.On first-quarter 2023 earnings call, Ecolab’s management confirmed that the repositioning of the Institutional business has been progressing well, as demonstrated by strong sales growth and margin leverage within the segment.Story continuesPer management, people order online and use takeout much more than before, translating to lower dine-in traffic. However, on the same call, Ecolab confirmed that the restaurant operators have been selling the same or more at a lower service cost as they have fewer people staying in the dining room. Despite this decline in foot traffic in restaurants, the company has gained market share. Per management, its teams have managed to drive share, pricing and innovation to ensure Ecolab’s continued strength in the segment. This raises our optimism about the company’s second-quarter revenue performance.We estimate the second-quarter Global Institutional &amp; Specialty segment revenues to be $1.21 billion, suggesting an improvement of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors at WorkRising demand for Pest Elimination (a component of Ecolab’s broader Other segment) in commercial businesses is likely to have driven the segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Ecolab has also started to provide disinfection services for its customers, which is also likely to have driven quarterly revenues.However, management sounded cautious regarding higher interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations, which are expected to have softened global demand. Management’s anticipation about inflation to remain high and continued geopolitical tensions is likely to have weighed on the company’s second-quarter performance. Also, continued higher energy surcharges impacting demand and global energy costs are likely to have weighed on the second-quarter segmental revenues.The Estimate PictureFor second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.87 billion for total revenues implies an improvement of 7.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $1.21, implying an improvement of 10% from the prior-year period’s reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ecolab this time around.

LNTH is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, Lantheus Holdings’ earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.9%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 25.8%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, Lantheus’ management confirmed that it has been continuing to register a robust uptick in sales of both PYLARIFY and DEFINITY. Per management, they continue to have the leading market share in their respective categories.However, it is worth mentioning that PYLARIFY is an F 18-labelled PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent used with PET or computed tomography, whereas DEFINITY is an injectable ultrasound-enhancing agent used in echocardiography examinations.The continued favorable adoption of PSMA PET with PYLARIFY is expected to have continued in the second quarter of 2023 on the back of its positive impact of the PSMA-targeted PET imaging on the U.S. prostate cancer community. This is likely to have considerably driven the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Lantheus Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLantheus Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLantheus Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lantheus Holdings, Inc. QuoteOn the call, management stated that PYLARIFY and DEFINITY enabled Lantheus to invest in its business to continue to expand its portfolio of commercial and clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical assets, including the recently completed in-licensing of two late-stage radiotherapeutic product candidates from POINT Biopharma and the acquisition of Cerveau Technologies, Inc. for MK-6240 (a second-generation F 18-labeled PET imaging agent that targets Tau tangles in Alzheimer’s disease).Per management, the company is also making impressive progress with PNT2002 and PNT2003, including in the clinical, regulatory and manufacturing programs as well as advancing commercial readiness. These developments buoy our optimism about Lantheus’ second-quarter performance.Story continuesIn February, Lantheus acquired Cerveau Technologies, which added MK-6240 to its asset pipeline. Following the buyout, Lantheus has been continuing to advance the utilization of MK-6240 in clinical development partnership. MK-6240 is currently being used in more than 60 academic and industry late-stage clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease therapeutic candidates under development by more than 16 pharmaceutical companies. These look promising for Lantheus.Lantheus’ DEFINITY, which has been registering strong growth over the past few months, is likely to have been another strong contributor to second-quarter revenues. Management’s observation about DEFINITY being the continued preferred ultrasound-enhancing agent in patient echocardiography exams looks promising for product sales in the second quarter.In April, Lantheus announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation for Lu-PNT2002 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In February, the company presented positive data regarding the potential benefits of piflufolastat F 18 on decisions on treatment plans. These raise our optimism about the stock.The Estimate PictureOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lantheus this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Lantheus has an Earnings ESP of +3.40%.

309,426b921d-ee88-3e64-b335-7bc4f03183e0,APD,2023-07-28,3 Hydrogen Stocks That Will Skyrocket Before 2025,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hydrogen-stocks-skyrocket-2025-133042411.html,1689946242,STORY,"['PLUG', 'APD']","[As an energy source, green hydrogen has two crucial advantages over competing substances.  First, unlike fossil fuels, it does not emit carbon into the atmosphere. Secondly, unlike solar and wind, it can be turned into liquid form, enabling it to store energy, be always available, and be used to power forms of transportation. Also noteworthy is that, unlike batteries, green hydrogen is not extremely bulky and does not use huge amounts of electricity, while any large vehicles using it can quickly be refueled.Taken together, these qualities will give green hydrogen important roles in this Green Era. Specifically, it will store energy, provide a reliable backup to wind and solar, and power large vehicles, including trucks, boats, and planes.With all of that said, here are three top hydrogen stocks that will benefit tremendously from the huge roles that Green Hydrogen will play in the Green Era.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlug Power (PLUG)An image of a hydrogen fuel pipeline running through a grassy field, with wind turbines and solar panels in the background. top hydrogen stocks to buySource: petrmalinak / ShutterstockIn a note to investors on July 6, Citi (NYSE:C) wrote that Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is well-positioned to become a top player in the global green hydrogen market.  I’ve long believed the firm was destined to play such a role.The bank also noted that Plug’s early forays into the space give it a leg up on its competitors and leave it “well positioned to benefit from growing demand for green H2 in hard-to-abate sectors.” Additionally, PLUG has already convinced several huge companies: Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and General Motors (NYSE:GM) to buy its green hydrogen. Finally, PLUG is discussing purchasing its fuel with multiple other major firms. The bank placed a “buy” rating on the stock.Also bullish about PLUG recently was investment bank Northland Capital. The firm upgraded the stock to “outperform” and placed a $22 price target on the name, Northland contended that PLUG is “now on a clear path to cash flow generation, and [its] momentum is picking up with every incremental deal announcement.”Story continuesAir Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)An image of a hexagon structure with the text H2 Hydrogen on a blue backgroundSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockIn his recent article about the top hydrogen stocks, another InvestorPlace columnist, Ian Cooper, reported that Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) “owns and operates more than 100 hydrogen plants around the world.” That huge infrastructure should leave the company very well-positioned to become a leading supplier of green hydrogen during the Green Era.Indeed, according to the company, it’s investing a vast $7 billion in what it calls “the world’s largest green hydrogen project.” In a joint venture with two firms in Saudi Arabia, APD plans to provide ” 650 tons per day of hydrogen by electrolysis.” The fuel will be used to “power trucks and buses around the world by 2025,” Air Products explained.The 23.8 forward price-earnings ratio of APD stock does not come close to reflecting the huge amount of money that the company will make from becoming a green hydrogen powerhouse.A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.Linde (LIN)Linde (NYSE:LIN) is becoming a major supplier of electrolyzers that are used to produce green hydrogen, as it plans to open a huge green energy plant near Nigra Falls in 2025.  Additionally, the company announced in April that it would provide green hydrogen for Dow’s (NYSE:DOW) plastics plant.Moreover, Linde’s status as the world’s “largest industrial gas company” will leave it well-positioned to become a green hydrogen powerhouse. Indeed, due to that position, the firm likely has plenty of potential partners and a large sales team that will enable it to build up its electrolyzer and green hydrogen businesses quickly.Additionally, due to its prior successes, the company has nearly $5 billion of cash that it can use to build up its green hydrogen infrastructure in the future.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PLUG.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer, and Seana Smith discuss potential streaming partners and ways broadcasters could consolidate viewership with this deal.Video TranscriptOne story that I've been following is the role of sports. Particularly the role of sports in the media landscape and with Disney. We've heard from CEO, Bob Iger. He's been very adamant that they will take ESPN fully over the top as a streaming service. He said that they are exploring strategic partnerships. There was a report that the NFL, some other major leagues, are currently having talks with Disney to potentially partner with them.So I've been digging into this. I've been speaking with a lot of analysts, a lot of experts in this space. And they've basically told me that this is going to be a very difficult endeavor. We heard from Comcast CEO earlier this morning saying that it's pretty improbable that they will ever partner with Disney and ESPN. So who could it be?Some names that have been thrown out there. Apple. We know Bob Iger has a very strong symbiotic relationship with Apple. We have the Vision Pro headset that could potentially feed into that. We have Apple with MLS soccer and Lionel Messi. Maybe that's a strategic partner. Or it could be any of the big internet companies.But I think a big question is, who will that be for Disney? And perhaps it isn't just one partner, it's perhaps multiple.- It's probably multiple partners, you would think, right, depending on how big, I guess, the player is. But even if it's Apple, I mean, I don't know if Apple necessarily wants to just be the money bag for ESPN to go out and get sports rights.When we think about how expensive these sports rights are going to be. If that NBA deal is maybe $75 billion, there's a reason Disney doesn't want to foot that bill. And normally in business, $75 billion deals don't just get done with one other partner either, right. There's a lot of banks and different people that could get involved there, maybe even private equity or something like that could also get involved with ESPN to sort of boost that.Story continuesI think the concept though, of the NFL investing is very fascinating to me. Because if it were the NBA or one of these leagues investing--- How likely do you think that is?- I think the NFL, it seems less likely when you look at the NFL's media strategy, right. The NFL is one of the most diversified weeks. First of all, it's its own business, right. It's its own major, major corporation. But also they're across all the streamers. They're on Amazon, they're on YouTube now, they're on Fox, they're on CBS, they're on NBC. That's a very deliberate thing by the NFL, right. They could be on one streamer if they wanted to and get a lot of money for it.But instead, they get more money by diversifying that way. But I do think leagues in general have an interest in creating their own content and having a place to bank that content. So you think like the NBA, to get people to be more superfans and watch five games instead of one, that makes sense.- But doesn't. NFL, essentially, have that with the NFL Network? I mean, the ability to do that, to really build out what they want for the league, the voice, everything like that That they would already-- I guess, what would that added benefit be?- For them to be invested in ESPN? I don't know. I don't know if I have a full answer there. Because I think that-- well, because I don't think you want to tie yourself to one thing, which is why I would say you wouldn't put it on something like the NFL Network or put it on ESPN, right. Because the NFL's too big the NFL is Americana at this point, they won that battle so like I wouldn't go narrow.- Yeah, and another story too is just-- when you have free to air sports, it's so easy to get this mass audience and this mass appeal. When you ask people to pay $20 to $30 for one thing, that's a harder ask. And that, I think, is something that analysts on Wall Street are grappling with. And the future is unknown.- And I also think just given the fact that there is so much uncertainty about who would even have interest, who would be willing to pay that, really just shows the pressure that Bob Iger is under right now. He kind of has his back up against the wall in terms of what he needs to do. And essentially, almost every single part of Disney's business, even looking out beyond ESPN, when we talk about the broader streaming strategy, when we talk about the parks business.Every single part of the business needs a revamp or needs some sort of, I guess, reshaping at this point. And given the fact that no one really knows who ESPN's partner will be. It's going to be an interesting story to follow. And Ali's going to be all over that one.- Yes, I will. Disney earnings are coming up in two weeks?- Two weeks?- Yeah.- And we'll see whether or not we get any more info from Iger on that call. All right, guys, we got to leave that there.]"

Today 21 Chicago-area students successfully completed the ComEd CONSTRUCT Youth Academy, a paid training program which puts them steps closer to pursuing careers in the fast-growing growing clean energy sector in Illinois.The new program is a part of ComEd's plan to grow its workforce to meet changing demands facing the grid and as customer demands evolve for the future. A recent study estimates that as many as 150,000 new clean energy jobs could be created by 2050 to support the clean energy transition underway in Illinois.""The transition to a cleaner energy future will certainly offer health and environmental benefits through improved air quality, but ComEd is also committed to ensuring that the job creation and economic opportunity sparked by this transition benefits every community we serve,"" said Keisha Parker, Vice President of External Affairs for ComEd. ""In collaboration with the YMCA and partners across the region, we are bringing job training and educational opportunities to our communities that will expose more youth to exciting career possibilities in the utilities and ensure the diverse and skilled talent pipeline that the jobs of the future will demand.""The CONSTRUCT Youth Academy launched in June as a three-week training program designed to expose high school students to what it’s like to work in the utilities and construction trades. During the program, students participated in a first-of-its-kind work-study experience, with opportunities to learn directly from utility leaders. Sessions exposed students to career possibilities and new advancements in the energy sector, including the use of drones to maintain and operate a modern grid, growth in solar and electric vehicles (EVs), energy efficiency programs that help customers lower energy usage while lowering the carbon footprint, and more.Story continues""Through the first-ever CONSTRUCT Youth Academy program, our students have been able to plant seeds for the future that will help them grow lifelong opportunities and strong foots for the future,"" said Dorri McWhorter, President and CEO of the YMCA.

Students completing the program will receive a stipend for their training.""Joining the CONSTRUCT Youth Academy training program has helped me learn more about career possibilities with ComEd,"" said Jayden Mosley, 15, a program graduate and South Chicago resident. ""But it was especially exciting to learn about the clean energy transition and the ways that new jobs will play a part in helping our communities and the environment. With new knowledge from this program, I’m excited about what the future holds for me and my community.""The CONSTRUCT Youth Academy was launched to meet the growing demand for skills training and builds on the success of the CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy, ComEd's premier workforce development program helping train residents for craft roles in the utilities and construction fields. To date, the program has graduated more than 800 residents, with a majority of participants from diverse communities, and a more than 70 percent job placement rate.The CONSTRUCT Youth Academy is one example of how ComEd is invested in growing job training and educational programs that will expand the pipeline of talent needed for future clean energy growth. ComEd also offers a range of in-depth job training and apprenticeship style programs, including the Craft Academy, the Dawson Tech Overhead Electrical Line Workers training program – a partnership with the City Colleges of Chicago – along with college scholarship programs, and in-school trades training in partnership with Chicago Public Schools to spur an interest in STEM careers.As a result of its growing investment in career readiness and education across the region, ComEd's job training and STEM education programs last year directly benefited more than 2,000 local residents.

ComEd has been hard at work for the past several months to ensure the company’s critical electric infrastructure is prepared to handle increased demand during times of prolonged higher temperatures. This proactive effort also includes infrastructure work to strengthen the local energy grid to prevent outages caused by severe summer storms.With severe weather showing up early and often, and high summer temperatures placing more stress on the electric grid, ComEd has taken steps to ensure reliable energy for the 9 million people it serves in northern Illinois.""Extreme heat resulting from climate change continues to impact our service territory, but we are ready to meet those challenges,"" said Terence Donnelley, president and COO of ComEd. ""The investments we are making to modernize the power grid are increasing our resilience to severe weather like heat waves.""System investments continue to keep the grid reliableComEd has a variety of programs and processes in place to protect against the impacts of severe weather, including Distribution Automation, a technology that has helped ComEd avoid more than 15 million customer outages; light detection and ranging, or Lidar, which helps to identify trees that might be more susceptible to the effects of climate change; and an outage prediction tool that uses analytics from system data to map out effective preventative maintenance.Last year, investments in the power grid continued to pay reliability dividends for ComEd customers as the electric company delivered record reliability. Since grid improvements began in 2011, overall reliability has improved more than 80 percent. In that time, ComEd has avoided more than 19 million power outages for customers, saving more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs. In 2022, ComEd had its best reliability on record.Story continuesEnergy efficiency tips for hot weatherThe projected weather system will bring a period of high heat and humidity. ComEd offers the following tips for customers to manage their energy usage, while saving money on their electric bills, during the heat:Clear area around cooling ventsFurniture, carpets, and other objects can block vents and prevent air from traveling. This blockage makes your cooling system work harder and prevents rooms from cooling down quickly.Use your windows to keep out heatInstall window coverings to prevent heat from getting in through your windows during the day.Operate your thermostat efficientlyDuring the summer season, set your thermostat to as high a temperature as possible while still maintaining personal comfort.If you’re not home for more than 8 hours, consider turning up your thermostat 7 to 10 degrees.Overnight, consider turning up your thermostat 3 to 4 degrees while sleeping.Smart thermostats can help you monitor and control your home’s temperature—saving you energy and money whether you are at home or away.Use fans and ventilation to cool your homeIf you use air conditioning to cool your home, a ceiling fan will allow you to raise the thermostat setting approximately 4 degrees with no reduction in comfort.Turn off ceiling fans when you leave the room. Remember that fans cool people, not rooms, by creating a wind chill effect.During the warmer-temperature months, set your fans counter-clockwise to push air towards the floor.Recent studies indicate that by 2050, temperatures in northern Illinois will rise and the summer will get increasingly humid. ComEd is taking steps to build infrastructure that is more resilient to the climate changes that pose growing risks to the grid.Storm SafetyWhile ComEd works to prevent as many outages as possible, severe storms can cause damage and power outages. ComEd urges customers to contact the company immediately if they experience a power outage.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Regional Bank Dividend Stocks to Buy. The US banking sector faced significant challenges this year due to the troubles encountered by major banks in the country, including Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), First Republic Bank, and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY). Concerned bank customers and investors rushed to withdraw their funds, prompting the federal government to take strong measures to prevent a broader panic that could disrupt the entire financial system. According to CNN, the three banks collectively had about $559 billion in total assets, which, when adjusted for inflation, exceeds the $523 billion held by the 25 banks that failed in 2008.Following this upheaval in the banking sector, regulators seized First Republic Bank in May and reached an agreement to sell most of its operations to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), ensuring stability and mitigating the risks associated with the situation. JPMorgan will be taking responsibility for all of First Republic's deposits, both insured and uninsured, amounting to $92 billion. Additionally, they are acquiring a large portion of the bank's assets, which include approximately $173 billion in loans and $30 billion in securities.Also read: 12 Best Performing Bank Stocks in 2023Though the situation has been handled as of now, the reasons behind the regional banking crisis in March are still active. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon mentioned that the crisis that caused the downfall of three regional U.S. banks this year has mostly subsided after the resolution of the First Republic. However, rising interest rates are causing banks to face bigger losses on securities and prompting savers to withdraw their cash, affecting the banks' profits. Additionally, losses on loans, especially in commercial real estate, are starting to impact banks' earnings. As of June 30, total deposits in US commercial banks stand at $17.4 trillion, down from over $18 trillion during the same period last year. In addition to this, bank stocks are also declining this year, as the S&amp;P Bank Select Industry is down by 10.37% year-to-date, compared with a 19.4% return of the S&amp;P 500.Story continuesThat said, the Fed’s recent bank stress test showed that all 23 big banks involved would have enough money to handle losses of up to $541 billion, even in a worst-case scenario where unemployment reaches 10% and the stock market drops by 45%, as reported by Barron’s. After successfully passing the stress test, numerous major banks have made announcements to increase their dividend payments. Some of the best dividend stocks in the banking sector such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) declared hikes in their payouts. In view of this, we will discuss some regional bank stocks that pay dividends.

These banks mainly operate in specific regions or local areas, rather than having a nationwide or global presence. From the resultant list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them.10. Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR) is a Texas-based bank holding company that provides a wide range of banking and financial services to its consumers. The company reported strong earnings in the first quarter of 2023 with its revenue of $531 million showing a 42.2% growth on a year-over-year basis. Its net income available to common shareholders came in at $176 million, up from $97.4 million in the prior-year period.Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR) has a track record of raising dividends for 29 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.87 per share and has a dividend yield of 3%, as of July 16. In addition to popular bank stocks like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), CFR is also a reliable option due to its strong dividend growth track record.As of the close of Q1 2023, 23 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned investments in Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR), worth collectively over $176 million. Among these hedge funds, Scopus Asset Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC mentioned Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE:CFR), the Texas‐based bank, was the largest detractor for the period. Given the heightened levels of uncertainty after the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank, regional banks were scrutinized as potential vulnerabilities within the U.S. banking system. Despite the recent events, we remain confident in Cullen/Frost’s ability to withstand short‐term volatility based on itslong and proven history and strong capital position. Since the company’s inception in 1868, Cullen/Frost has employed a conservative strategy and a client service‐centric model that allowed it to be the only Texas bank to survive the 1980s Texas banking collapse, oil crisis and real estate market crash without federal assistance or a takeover, and it was also the first bank to decline TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) bailout funds during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Cullen/Frost continues to utilize this strategy, with a relatively low loan‐to‐deposit ratio of 38% and current capital ratios in excess of well‐capitalized levels. The company’s strong balance sheet management and steady, relationship‐based approach have led to consistent levels of profitability and 29 consecutive years of dividend increases. We believe Cullen/Frost remains in a strong position to navigate the current short‐term environment, continue to win market share in areas such as Houston and Dallas, and generate returns for shareholders in the long run.”9.

However, with U.S. crude prices climbing back to $80 per barrel, service companies are betting on a recovery in demand.""Uncertainty around the macro outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices maintained an underlying sense of apprehension in the U.S. drilling market during the quarter,"" said Helmerich &amp; Payne's chief executive, John Lindsay.""Recently however, some of this uncertainty has receded, and we are starting to see signs of optimism on the horizon,"" he added.Lindsay said he expects rig count activity to hit a bottom in the quarter ending September, and a recovery in the following quarter.The upbeat outlook and a better-than-expected profit of $1.09 per share helped Helmerich &amp; Payne shares rise 5.9% to $45.19 in afternoon trading.Rival Patterson-UTI Energy also forecast a rise in rig count and fracking activity later this and next.""We believe the industry rig count is near a bottom,"" said Andy Hendricks, CEO of Patterson-UTI Energy, adding that the company expects additional rig releases in the next few weeks before drilling activity recovers later in the year.On the pressure pumping side, Hendricks said activity has already reached a trough in July.While pressure pumping prices for spot work fell about 30% in recent months, it should reverse those losses as activity picks up, Hendricks added.Nextier Oilfield Solutions on Wednesday had also forecast a recovery in fracking demand next year, adding that a shortage of equipment could hinder growth in U.S. oil and gas production.Patterson-UTI, which is in the process of merging with Nextier, on Wednesday reported quarterly profit of 45 cents per share, 1 cent ahead of analysts' estimates.Patterson-UTI shares were up 2.2% at $15.75 and Nextier shares were up 0.9% at $11.77 on Thursday afternoon.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Matthew Lewis)]"

CL-EMarket Share InformationManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods).Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce and certain club retailers and discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information reported by the Company may be different from market share information reported by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, net selling price increases, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin levels, earnings per share levels, financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange, the impact of COVID-19, the impact of the war in Ukraine, cost-reduction plans (including the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative), tax rates, interest rates, new product introductions, digital capabilities, commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, share repurchases or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements"" in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and subsequent filings with the SEC). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe following provides definitions and other information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and the related prepared materials and webcast, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:Base Business: Base Business refers to non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Base Business operating results exclude, as applicable, charges related to an ERISA litigation matter, a foreign tax matter, the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and product recall costs.Organic sales growth: Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments.Free cash flow before dividends: Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures.This press release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and Organic sales growth (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See ""Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes"" for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 versus 2022 included with this release for a comparison of Organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are disclosed on both an as reported (GAAP) and Base Business (non-GAAP) basis. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See ""Non-GAAP Reconciliations"" for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.The Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.As management uses free cash flow before dividends to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends, fund future business opportunities and repurchase stock, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See ""Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows"" for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.(See attached tables for second quarter results.)Table 1Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20232022Net sales$4,822$4,484Cost of sales2,0351,930Gross profit2,7872,554Gross profit margin57.8%57.0%Selling, general and administrative expenses1,7681,657Other (income) expense, net4513Operating profit974884Operating profit margin20.2%19.7%Non-service related postretirement costs2912Interest (income) expense, net5831Income before income taxes887841Provision for income taxes353202Effective tax rate39.8%24.0%Net income including noncontrolling interests534639Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests3236Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$502$603Earnings per common shareBasic$0.61$0.72Diluted$0.60$0.72Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic829.4836.8Diluted831.3839.4Advertising$601$501Table 2Colgate-Palmolive CompanyCondensed Consolidated Statements of IncomeFor the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022(Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited)20232022Net sales$9,592$8,883Cost of sales4,0933,757Gross profit5,4995,126Gross profit margin57.3%57.7%Selling, general and administrative expenses3,5263,298Other (income) expense, net9084Operating profit1,8831,744Operating profit margin19.6%19.6%Non-service related postretirement costs32350Interest (income) expense, net11258Income before income taxes1,4481,636Provision for income taxes500394Effective tax rate34.5%24.1%Net income including noncontrolling interests9481,242Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests7480Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company$874$1,162Earnings per common shareBasic(1)$1.05$1.39Diluted(1)$1.05$1.38Supplemental Income Statement InformationAverage common shares outstandingBasic830.4838.7Diluted832.1841.5Advertising$1,180$1,007Note:(1) Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter and any year-to-date period presented.

Most eyes will be on the energy sector with big oil titans Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) rounding out this week’s earnings lineup. Notably, their stocks currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, Friday’s lineup will feature a number of intriguing stocks from various industries with the Zacks consumer staples and broader Auto, Tires &amp; Trucks sectors standing out.Auto, Tires &amp; Trucks CNH Industrial (CNHI) and Gentex (GNTX) are appealing among the broader auto sector with both sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of their Q2 reports tomorrow. It's noteworthy that CNH Industrial’s Automotive-Foreign Industry is in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries.  CNH Industrial: CNH Industrial should benefit from its strong business environment as one of the leading equipment and services companies for agricultural and construction equipment including two-wheel and four-wheel tractors. Second-quarter earnings are expected to rise 11% year over year at $0.48 per share with sales forecasted to rise 11% as well to $6.78 billion. At the moment CNHI shares are very attractive for their price-to-earnings valuation and have an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGentex: Expecting strong quarterly growth Gentex has carved out a niche as a supplier of automatic dimming, rear-view mirrors, and electronics to the automotive industry.It's noteworthy that Gentex stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth and an overall “A” VGM Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.

Among the space Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Church &amp; Dwight Co (CHD) have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ahead of their Q2 reports.Story continuesChurch &amp; Dwight: Being a mainstay for many years as a provider of household, personal care, and specialty products usually makes Church &amp; Dwight stock worthy of investors' consideration at some point. Notably, an earnings beat would be Church &amp; Dwight’s 10th consecutive quarter of surpassing bottom-line expectations.Now looks like a good time to buy with Q2 earnings expected to rise 4% YoY at $0.79 per share and sales anticipated at $1.42 billion, up 7%. Church &amp; Dwight was founded in 1846 and despite the company's maturity it intriguingly has a “B” Style Scores grade for Growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchColgate-Palmolive: Of course, Colgate is another popular name among consumer goods with its iconic toothpaste brand and home care products.

This notion saw investors lock-in some profits in oil prices, although they were still headed for strong weekly gains.Brent oil futures fell 0.5% to $83.30 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.5% to $79.66 a barrel by 21:00 (01:00 GMT). Both contracts were set to add between 2.5% and 3.5% this week - their fifth straight positive week.Stronger dollar pressures oil pricesThe dollar jumped 0.6% against a basket of currencies on Thursday, rebounding sharply from recent losses on signs of resilience in the U.S. economy. Strength in the dollar usually dents commodities priced in the greenback.The dollar was also supported by increased buying after the European Central Bank signaled a potential end to its rate hike cycle, which diminished the appeal of the euro.Strong U.S. economic data saw investors pricing in the possibility of at least one more rate hike by the Fed, after the central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points this week and kept the door open for more hikes.Higher oil prices also factor into stickier inflation, which could keep the Fed hawkish in the coming months.Tightening supply, stronger demand to keep oil buoyedBut despite fears of tighter U.S. monetary policy, the outlook for oil prices was buoyed by signs of tightening supplies, as recent production cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia began to take effect.Story continuesReports suggested on Friday that Saudi Arabia’s 1 million barrel per day cut could extend until end-September. This helped oil markets largely look past data showing a smaller-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories, despite the onset of the demand-heavy summer season.Markets were also betting that more stimulus measures in world no.1 crude importer China will drive up demand this year.Related ArticlesOil retreats from 3-mth highs amid profit taking, dollar recoveryOil prices slip on demand concerns, remain on track for weekly gainAnalysis-China's gasoline demand peak nears as EV boom hastens transition]"

The Fed itself was no longer forecasting a recession, given the robust pace of recent growth, Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday after the central bank returned to the path of monetary tightening with a quarter point rate hike after a pause in June.The second quarter estimate for U.S. GDP — along with lower weekly employment claims and positive durable goods data — was just the deal needed by oil longs trying to get U.S. crude to make the leap this week to $80 territory after it had stayed above $75 since Friday.The now near two-month rally in oil has its roots in production cut rhetoric that the Saudis and others in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have drummed up since June.On top of cuts pledged by OPEC+, which groups 23 nations altogether, the Saudis have committed to cut an additional million barrels per day. Despite talk of extreme tightness in global oil markets from all those supply reductions, U.S. stockpiles saw smaller than expected draws last week for a second week in a row.But oil bulls appeared unfazed by the U.S. inventory data, saying the cuts will eventually show in upcoming weekly numbers.“Overall, oil fundamentals look solid,” Scott Shelton, energy futures broker and analyst for ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina, said in a commentary issued early Thursday. “I don’t see a lot out here …to hold back oil prices going higher.”Story continuesAt Thursday’s close, the front-month contract for New York-based West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, settled at $80.09 per barrel, up $1.31, or 1.7%, on the day after peaking earlier at $80.61, its highest since April 19.If the U.S. crude benchmark keeps to its momentum — and there’s little to suggest why it wouldn’t — it would finish up for a fifth straight week that has already delivered a gain of 13% into the pocket of oil bulls for all July.The front-month for London-based Brent crude settled at $84.24 per barrel, up $1.32, or 1.6%, on the day after a three-month high at $84.51. Like WTI, Brent was headed for a fifth weekly gain that already put the global crude benchmark up 12% for this month.The only immediate downside to oil came in the form of the higher Dollar Index, which continued its rebound for a second straight week from the 15-month lows hit earlier in July.Longs plowed into the dollar — whose rise is always a negative to commodities priced in the currency — after the European Central Bank signaled that its rate hike on Thursday might be its last for the year ahead of a pause likely to begin in September.The ECB’s stance hammered the euro and pushed the dollar up instead, especially after the Fed suggested a day earlier that it would keep rates restrictive for as long as needed to bring U.S. inflation, now hovering at 3%, back to its long-term target of 2%.But some say the oil rally could bring its own antidote to the market if inflation spiked as a result, forcing the Fed and ECB to pile on more rate hikes that would eventually hurt demand across the board — including in oil.“There are, of course, an abundance of upside risks to the inflation data from the economy continuing to display significant resilience, as we've already seen this year, or fresh energy or food price shocks,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Related ArticlesOil: U.S. crude back to $80 on back of bustling economy Gold has biggest daily drop since late June, in aftermath of Fed, ECBJuly 2023 set to be world's hottest month on record]"

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Colgate-Palmolive is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.38% heading into earnings season.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS SurpriseColgate-Palmolive Company price-eps-surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

EPS came in at $0.58, compared to $0.42 in the year-ago quarter.The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion, representing a surprise of +0.75%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +5.45%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $0.55.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Juniper performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Net Revenues- Product: $963.20 million versus the five-analyst average estimate of $945.87 million.

This compares to earnings of $0.42 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.45%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this computer network equipment maker would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 11.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Juniper , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.43 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.27 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Juniper shares have lost about 7.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Juniper?While Juniper has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Juniper: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.61 on $1.47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.34 on $5.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

""We were particularly encouraged by the momentum we experienced in our Enterprise business, which not only had a record quarter, but also represented both our largest and fastest growing vertical for a third consecutive quarter. Our Mist AI platform continues to win in the market, driving record revenue for our wireless, wired switching and SD-WAN offerings, along with a record number of full-stack wins, in the Q2 period. While we are currently facing some near-term order weakness from our Cloud and to a lesser degree our Service Provider customers, we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term growth based on continued Enterprise momentum and our expectations for an eventual recovery in our Cloud business.""Story continues""We delivered another quarter of improved profitability in Q2, as non-GAAP gross and operating margin both exceeded the mid-point of our guidance, which enabled us to achieve non-GAAP EPS toward the high-end of our outlook,"" said Juniper’s CFO, Ken Miller. ""While we expect revenue to be challenged over the next few quarters, we remain committed to delivering greater than 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in 2023.""Balance Sheet and Other Financial ResultsTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of June 30, 2023 were $1,296.4 million, compared to $1,285.6 million as of June 30, 2022, and $1,191.0 million as of March 31, 2023.Cash flows provided by operations for the second quarter of 2023 were $343.0 million, compared to $266.9 million of cash flows used in operations in the second quarter of 2022, and $191.5 million of cash flows provided by operations in the first quarter of 2023.Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was 57 days in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 74 days in the second quarter of 2022, and 70 days in the first quarter of 2023.Capital expenditures were $41.1 million, and depreciation and amortization expense was $48.0 million during the second quarter of 2023.OutlookThese metrics are provided on a non-GAAP basis, except for revenue and share count. Non-GAAP earnings per share is on a fully diluted basis. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels.For the third quarter, we expect to see continued weakness in bookings, particularly with our Cloud and, to a lesser extent, our Service Provider customers. We believe the softness in bookings is largely attributable to customer digestion of previously placed orders and certain projects being pushed to future periods. We expect the macro-economic environment to remain challenged, which may continue to impact customer spending. These factors are negatively impacting our revenue expectations.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to modestly increase in Q3 2023. This forecast assumes supply chain-related costs improve but remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.We will continue to manage non-GAAP operating expenses prudently and expect a sequential decline.Q3 2023Our guidance for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 is as follows:Revenue will be approximately $1,385 million, plus or minus $50 million.Non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 58.5%, plus or minus 1.0%.Non-GAAP operating expenses will be approximately $585 million, plus or minus $5 million.Non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately 16.3% at the mid-point of revenue guidance.Non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 19.0%.Non-GAAP net income per share will be approximately $0.54, plus or minus $0.05. This assumes a share count of approximately 328 million shares.For more detailed insight on guidance, please refer to the CFO Commentary that can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://investor.juniper.net.Capital ReturnOur Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share to be paid on September 22, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 1, 2023.

Juniper is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future hiring needs, the type and volume of equity awards necessary for such future hiring, and the price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. Amortization of intangible assets is significantly impacted by the timing and size of any future acquisitions. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading.This press release, including the tables above, includes the following non-GAAP financial measures derived from our Preliminary Consolidated Statements of Operations: operating income; operating margin; net income; and diluted net income per share. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the table above should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. Certain of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.We utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, forecasting and planning for future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. We consider the use of the non-GAAP measures presented above to be helpful in assessing the performance of the continuing operation of our business. By continuing operation, we mean the ongoing revenue and expenses of the business, excluding certain items that render comparisons with prior periods or analysis of on-going operating trends more difficult, such as expenses not directly related to the actual cash costs of development, sale, delivery or support of our products and services, or expenses that are reflected in periods unrelated to when the actual amounts were incurred or paid. Consistent with this approach, we believe that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of our financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, allows for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. In addition, we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community and believe that continuing to provide non-GAAP measures provides investors with a tool for comparing results over time. In assessing the overall health of our business for the periods covered by the table above and, in particular, in evaluating the financial line items presented in the table above, we have excluded items in the following three general categories, each of which are described below: Acquisition Related Charges, Other Items, and Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We also provide additional detail below regarding the shares used to calculate our non-GAAP net income per share. Notes identified for line items in the table above correspond to the appropriate note description below. With respect to the items excluded from our forward-looking non-GAAP measures and reconciliation of such measures, please see the ""Outlook"" section above.The above tables and reconciliations can also be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.juniper.net.Note A: Acquisition Related Charges. We exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. The amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with acquisitions results in recording expenses in our GAAP financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash. Moreover, had we internally developed the products acquired, the amortization of intangible assets, and the expenses of uncompleted research and development would have been expensed in prior periods. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses. In addition, acquisitions result in non-continuing operating expenses, which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our business operations. We believe that providing non-GAAP information for acquisition-related expense items in addition to the corresponding GAAP information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies.Note B: Other Items. We exclude certain other items that are the result of either unique, infrequent or unplanned events, including the following, when applicable: (i) strategic investment-related gain or loss, including gain or loss from our equity method investment and our privately-held investments; (ii) legal reserve and settlement charges or benefits; (iii) gain or loss on significant isolated events or transactions, including divestitures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which are directly related to the events, objectively quantifiable, and not expected to occur regularly in the future that are not indicative of our core operating results; (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt; (v) significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations, including the impact of income tax reform; (vi) recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature; and (vii) the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, the non-GAAP results exclude the effects of NQDC-related investments. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods.In addition, we exclude restructuring benefits or charges as these result from events that arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. As such, we believe these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred or comparisons to past operating results. We also exclude gains or losses related to strategic investments as well as significant isolated events as they are directly related to an event that is distinct and does not reflect current ongoing business operations. In the case of legal reserves and settlements, these gains or losses are recorded in the period in which the matter is concluded or resolved even though the subject matter of the underlying dispute may relate to multiple or different periods. As such, we believe that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Additionally, we exclude previously unrecognized tax benefits that are non-recurring in nature which are recorded in the period in which applicable statutes of limitation lapse or upon the completion of tax review cycles as the tax matter may relate to multiple or different periods. Further, certain items related to global tax reform may continue to impact the business and are generally unrelated to the current level of business activity. We believe these tax events limit the comparability with prior periods and that these expenses or benefits do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non-GAAP financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance and future liquidity of our business. Because of these factors, we assess our operating performance with these amounts both included and excluded, and by providing this information, we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations.Note C: Share-Based Compensation Related Items. We provide non-GAAP information relative to our expense for share-based compensation and related payroll tax. Due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, which affect the calculations of share-based compensation, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies and is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation on our results of operations. Further, expense associated with granting share-based awards does not reflect any cash expenditures by the company as no cash is expended.Note D: Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share Items. We provide diluted non-GAAP net income per share. The diluted non-GAAP net income per share includes additional dilution from potential issuance of common stock, except when such issuances would be anti-dilutive.Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(in millions)(unaudited)June 30, 2023December 31, 2022ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$1,089.4$880.1Short-term investments144.7210.3Accounts receivable, net of allowances908.51,227.3Inventory925.7619.4Prepaid expenses and other current assets682.7680.0Total current assets3,751.03,617.1Property and equipment, net689.1666.8Operating lease assets124.3141.6Long-term investments62.3139.6Purchased intangible assets, net126.2160.5Goodwill3,734.43,734.4Other long-term assets888.2866.7Total assets$9,375.5$9,326.7LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$371.8$347.4Accrued compensation280.1306.1Deferred revenue1,037.91,020.5Other accrued liabilities572.4404.9Total current liabilities2,262.22,078.9Long-term debt1,602.61,601.3Long-term deferred revenue727.3642.6Long-term income taxes payable197.2279.4Long-term operating lease liabilities95.5117.7Other long-term liabilities135.8131.7Total liabilities5,020.64,851.6Total stockholders' equity4,354.94,475.1Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$9,375.5$9,326.7Juniper Networks, Inc.Preliminary Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows(in millions)(unaudited)Six Months Ended June 30,20232022Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$109.8$169.1Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Share-based compensation expense122.992.4Depreciation, amortization, and accretion98.5111.5Operating lease assets expense20.320.3Gain on divestiture—(45.8)Loss (gain) on privately-held investments, net (1)92.0(5.9)Loss from equity method investment (1)4.20.5Other (1)2.713.8Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions:Accounts receivable, net319.5(54.2)Inventory (1)(315.0)(126.2)Prepaid expenses and other assets (1)(100.0)(346.9)Accounts payable22.088.5Accrued compensation(26.1)(54.7)Income taxes payable83.9(3.9)Other accrued liabilities(1.5)17.1Deferred revenue101.350.6Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities534.5(73.8)Cash flows from investing activities:Purchases of property and equipment(83.2)(49.5)Proceeds from divestiture, net—89.1Purchases of available-for-sale debt securities(12.9)(104.1)Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities23.974.8Proceeds from maturities and redemptions of available-for-sale debt securities128.8218.8Purchases of equity securities(3.5)(12.2)Proceeds from sales of equity securities7.83.3Payments for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired—(3.9)Funding of loan receivable(7.7)—Other1.51.4Net cash provided by investing activities54.7217.7Cash flows from financing activities:Repurchase and retirement of common stock(271.3)(226.3)Proceeds from issuance of common stock31.629.1Payment of dividends(140.5)(134.8)Payment of debt issuance costs(1.3)—Net cash used in financing activities(381.5)(332.0)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash1.8(14.0)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash209.5(202.1)Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period897.7942.7Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period$1,107.2$740.6Non-cash investing activity:Equity method investment$—$40.3__________________(1)The prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230727337720/en/ContactsInvestor Relations: Jess LubertJuniper Networks(408) 936-3734jlubert@juniper.netMedia Relations: Leslie MooreJuniper Networks(408) 936-5767llmoore@juniper.net]"

Speaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.Story continuesMatthew J. FlanneryThank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. As you've heard us say since the beginning of the year, 2023 is about raising the bar off of last year's record results our second quarter performance across growth, profitability and returns provides evidence of that. I'm pleased with how the year is playing out, including the Ahern integration, which remains on track. Of course, key to all of this is our employees who do an exceptional job supporting our customers every day. Without them, we wouldn't be able to generate the results we consistently deliver.And I'm pleased to report that once again, they've done this with safety at the forefront as our company-wide recordable rate remained well below one in the second quarter. Importantly, our growth shows that we continue to outpace our underlying markets as we leverage our competitive advantages to provide a superior level of customer service. So let's dig into the results.Total revenue rose by 28% year-on-year to a second quarter record of almost $3.6 billion. Within this, rental revenue grew 21% as reported with broad-based demand across verticals regions and customer segments, while fleet productivity increased 2.1% on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% to a second quarter record $1.7 billion driving solid margin expansion. Adjusted EPS grew by 26% to a second quarter record of $9.88. And critically, our return on invested capital set another new high watermark at 13.4%. In short, we're on track for another record year driven by robust customer activity. And the increases to our full year guidance reflects our continued confidence in customer demand. Used equipment sales were another highlight in the quarter. We generated a record second quarter proceeds of $382 million. The retail market remains very strong and we also broadened our channel mix as we discussed we would last quarter.Combined with the improvements we've seen across most of the supply chain, this has allowed us to refresh our fleet by rotating some of the older assets out. As you saw, rental CapEx totaled $1.25 billion in the quarter, in line with our expectations and helping to ensure that we have the capacity our customers need to support their projects today and going forward. And as I alluded to earlier, the integration of Ahern remains on track. The teams have come together especially well, and our second quarter results reflect the ongoing improvements in the efficiency of their business. And at this point, we're focused on optimizing the combined branch network and fleet, which should be completed by year-end. Now let's take a closer look at the second quarter demand.Key verticals saw broad-based growth led by industrial manufacturing, Metals &amp; Minerals and Power. Nonres construction was also up double digits. Within this, our customers kicked off new projects across the board, including numerous EV plants and semiconductor plants, solar power facilities, infrastructure projects and for the Buffalo Bill fans out there, a new stadium. Geographically, we saw growth in all of our regions on both the reported and pro forma basis.And our specialty business delivered another excellent quarter with rental revenue up 17% year-on-year organically, and double-digit gains across all major categories. Within Specialty, we opened 19 new locations in the second quarter and are on track for the 40 cold starts this year. Turning to capital allocation. We returned over $350 million to shareholders during the quarter through share buybacks and dividends are on track to return over $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders this year. And our balance sheet remains in excellent shape.Looking ahead to 2020, 2023 is on track to be another record year across a variety of KPIs, including revenue, EBITDA, EPS and returns. We're encouraged by the customer sentiment and external indicators, which point to growth and give us confidence in our updated guidance. For example, the ABC's contractor confidence index remained strong across the second quarter as did its backlog index. The Dodge Momentum Index was up 19% year-over-year in June, while nonres construction employment growth also remains solid.And most importantly, our own customer confidence index continues to reflect their optimism. Beyond 2023, we remain positive on the longer-term outlook. Driven by key tailwinds, including infrastructure, industrial manufacturing and energy and power. As we shared at our Investor Day in May, we spent the last decade building unique and diverse capabilities that position us very well for the $2 trillion plus of construction projects underpinned by these tailwinds over the next decade.Put simply, our advantages across scale, complex solutions, technology and people put us in a first call position. And we believe this provides a platform for leveraging our resilient business model and pursuing continued growth, both organically and through M&amp;A. Finally, I want to highlight our new sustainability report, which we released yesterday. While there's a lot of great content in that report that we're very proud of. This year, I'd especially point out to the work our team has done quantifying how the rental business model aligns with key aspects of sustainability. For example, less equipment needs to be manufactured because of rental, which has clear benefits. While the equipment that we have in our fleet also helps our customers reduce their emissions intensity based on its younger age and greater fuel efficiency. And not only does this benefit our customers, we believe that it also benefits our employees, the communities we're operating in and our shareholders.Before I hand the call over to Ted, I'll sum up today by saying I'm very pleased with how the year is playing out. We entered 2023 with high expectations. And as you can see through our results, that's what we're delivering. We feel good about the rest of the year and what's ahead for United Rentals and our investors. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Ted before we open the line for Q&amp;A. Ted, over to you.William GraceThanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone. As you saw in our second quarter release, our team produced strong results that were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track for another record year. And as we shared at our Investor Day, we continue to feel very good about our prospects beyond 2023 based on the tailwinds we've discussed extensively. One quick reminder before I jump into the numbers. As usual, the figures I'll be discussing are as reported, except where I call them at as pro forma, which are adjusted to include Ahern stand-alone results from last year. So with that said, let's get into the details.Second quarter rental revenue was a record $2.98 billion. That's a year-over-year increase of $519 million or 21%, supported by diverse strength across our end markets. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $443 million or 22%. Our average fleet size increased by 25.5%, providing a $514 million benefit which was partially offset by a decline in as-reported fleet productivity of 2% or $41 million and our usual fleet inflation of 1.5% or $30 million.Also within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $75 million or 19.3% and re-rent provided an additional $1 million. I'll note that on a pro forma basis, rental revenue was up a robust 12.4% year-over-year and fleet productivity increased 2.1% as industry discipline continues to support a healthy rate environment. Turning to used results. Our second quarter revenue increased 133% to $382 million as we continue to return to more normalized volumes while our second quarter adjusted used margin of 57.3% reflected healthy pricing.Notably, as we said we would, we've expanded our channel mix to support these higher used volumes. During the quarter, retail accounted for 65% of our mix, consistent with its longer-term proportion versus 90% last year. Within this shift, we doubled our retail volume and remains a very strong demand environment.Moving to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was just under $1.7 billion, another second quarter record, reflecting an increase of $384 million or 29%. The dollar change includes a $310 million increase from rental within which OER contributed $298 million, ancillary added $15 million and re-rent was down $3 million. Outside of rental, used sales added $117 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $8 million.SG&amp;A increased $51 million due primarily to increases in variable costs such as higher commissions. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&amp;A declined 180 basis points year-on-year to a second quarter record low of 10.6% of total revenue, so nice efficiency there.Looking at second quarter profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points on an as-reported basis and increased 130 basis points on a pro forma basis to 47.7%. This translates to an as-reported flow-through of 49% and pro forma flow-through of better than 54%. And finally, adjusted EPS increased 26% to a second quarter record of $9.88.Shifting to CapEx. Gross rental CapEx was $1.25 billion and net rental CapEx was $869 million. This represents an increase of $161 million in net CapEx year-over-year, supporting our continued growth in 2023. Year-to-date, gross CapEx has totaled roughly $2.05 billion. This equates to about 60% of the midpoint of our full year rental CapEx guidance which is where we expected to be at this time of the year.Turning to return on invested capital and free cash flow, ROIC, which, as you know, is a critical metric for us to a new record at 13.4% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year and remains well above our weighted average cost of capital. Free cash flow also remains a good story with the quarter coming in at $340 million, or a trailing 12-month free cash margin of 12.3%, all while continuing to fund significant growth.Moving to the balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter improved to an all-time low of 1.8x or a decline of 10 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. And our liquidity at the end of June exceeded $2.7 billion with no long-term maturities until 2027. Notably, this was after returning $352 million to shareholders in the quarter including $250 million through share repurchases and $102 million via dividends.So let's look forward and talk about our increased guidance, which reflects our continued confidence that 2023 will be a record year. Total revenue is now expected in the range of $14 billion to $14.3 billion, implying a $200 million increase in midpoint and full year growth of around 21.5% and pro forma growth of roughly 13.5%. Within total revenue, our used sales guidance is now implied at around $1.45 billion or an increase of $150 million, reflecting better-than-expected pricing and stronger-than-expected retail demand.We've increased our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $100 million at midpoint to a range of $6.75 billion to $6.9 billion. This continues to imply as reported flow-through of around 48% and pro forma flow-through in the mid-50s. On the fleet side, we've narrowed our gross CapEx range by $50 million between $3.35 billion and $3.55 billion. Given the increase in our used sales expectations, this now implies net CapEx between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. And finally, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance by $175 million at midpoint to between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, which is before repurchases and dividends that together should return over $1.4 billion of cash to our investors or better than $20 per share. So with that, let me turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A. Operator, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from David Raso with Evercore ISI.David Michael RasoI was wondering if you could help us with how you're thinking about fleet productivity, the rest of the year and maybe a little more color on what drove the pro forma decline from 5.9% down to 2% for the second quarter?Matthew J. FlannerySure, David, it's Matt. So as far as what drove the pro forma down, I mean it's -- we're pleased with the pro forma being up 2.1%. We understand some of the concern out there? And is that telling the Street something. So I'll be clear about a few things since we don't actually give you the whole numbers. We've said we talked to you qualitatively about it. This is not a demand or a rate issue. The industry still remains in really good shape. I think you're seeing that through the others that report the actual numbers. Rate environment is strong, and frankly, the discipline in the industry is strong and demand is supporting that.So that's first off. This is really a time issue for us. We made the decision to front-load fleet this year. To tampen down the very, very aggressive time utilizations we've been running, frankly, for a couple of years. And we didn't really think it was responsive to our customers' needs, and we're doing a little bit of too much hand-to-mouth putting big relationships at risk. We weren't comfortable with that. So we front-loaded our fleet, you remember back in the fourth quarter last year, and that's on top of bringing in the Ahern fleet.We're very pleased of how it's working out. And just to put it in context, although I'm not going to revert to giving back whole numbers. Our actual time utilization in Q2 was higher than pre-COVID averages and higher than the last time we gave you guys time utilization in 2019. So this is still strong time utilization just compared to the very frothy almost inflated time mute that we ran last year because we couldn't get the fleet timely enough, it's dragging a comp issue, and that's all this is.David Michael RasoAnd regarding the rest of the year, how should we think about year-over-year fleet productivity that's baked into the guide?Matthew J. FlanneryYes. I think you'll see these dynamics play through in Q3 similar to what they did in Q2. We'll continue to add seasonal build, but there were seasonal build into comps as well. So we think these dynamics will play through. And we're very comfortable. We continue to see a strong rate environment. We continue to -- we'll continue to bring in fleet to support this demand in Q3. And so we think the dynamics will be similar.David Michael RasoSo if the fleet productivity is similar in the back half of the year as the second quarter, where does that leave you at the end of the year as we think about '24 you made the comment just now about time you on a historical basis, is still sort of above average. Is that how you see the full year time you -- just trying to think about your confidence in starting the conversations for rates for '24. Where are we exiting our thoughts on this time you level versus history?Matthew J. FlanneryYes. To be clear, we don't want to get into forecasting ahead that far. But I will tell you, when we said this in May at the Investor Day, we do view '24 as a growth year. And if you do the math on the capital guide we gave and where we started the year, we're going to start the year with more fleet to support growth.We do think the end markets will come out of an exit rate this year at strong end market demand. We still believe that. So and then from there, we'll build up through our planning process towards the end of this year. We'll build up what we think we need from more growth CapEx. We do expect that we'll continue -- this will be a more normalized replacement CapEx. You're seeing that in this quarter as well, and we expect to do that next year as well. We want to replace somewhere around 10% to 12% of our fleet per year, and I think this new number puts us right in the center of that target.William GraceDavid, this is Ted. The one thing I might add is Matt had the comment about second quarter time relative to history. Just to be clear, for the full year, we would expect the same to be true. Relative to history, 2023 will be a strong time year.David Michael RasoOkay. That's helpful. And on the rest of the year guide, I'm talking reported the implied EBITDA margins are down a little bit from the second half of last year. But in the first half of this year, your EBITDA margins were 50 bps higher than a year ago. So just curious why the margins would be down year-over-year in the second half but having been up in the first half of this year.William GraceYes. So I'd say a couple of things there, David. One, we always caution people against anchoring to the midpoint. But Ahern is really kind of the factor that people need to be thinking about as they think about first half and second half dynamics year-on-year. We've been clear to talk about pro forma flow-through in the mid-50s.We've been delivering that, and we would expect that to be true in the back half of the year, which will be driving margin expansion on a pro forma basis, which, as Matt said, is the way we think about our business.David Michael RasoAnd last quick one, sorry to hog the call here, apologies. But your implied free cash flow the rest of the year and your EBITDA, it would imply that the financial leverage at the end of the year is that $1.6 billion so to get back to even the low end of your target of 2% to 3% for leverage would imply you have about $2.8 billion to put to work just to get to the low end.Just curious how you're thinking about deploying that. And again, that already accounts for $500 million repo, the rest of the year and a couple of hundred million of dividends. So this is above and beyond that.William GraceCorrect, it does. And this is one of the things we've been working on internally and we'll work on it further as the year progresses. For 2023, kind of our allocation of capital is committed, as you know. As it relates to next year, we will have decisions to make and certainly, we'll have an update for where we end up come January, I would expect. But we're left with a couple of options, and we've talked about this publicly.On one hand, there is the potential that we could lower the range, which is something we talked about when we introduced the new capital allocation strategy in 2019 or you could keep it where it is. That's one of the things we're working on trying to figure out what's the best way to allocate capital to drive shareholder value. So there's not much more specific I can add right now. But certainly, that's how we're thinking about it.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.Robert Cameron WertheimerSo I had a question on Ahern and just the maturation of acquisitions in general. And I know you talked about how you sort of scrambled the egg and you can't always unscramble it but I assume that you've still got some ongoing repair and maintenance as you sort of fix up a fleet that was presumably underinvested in. And I assume there's also a process just because you guys have so much process you have so many SKUs and so forth of training people up and so forth. So I just wonder if you have any comments on how long or how big that margin differential is and how that maturation of that acquisition drags up margins.Are we there now? Or is it going to take 2 or 3 or is it going to be a tailwind for 2 or 3 years? Or any commentary around that would be helpful.Matthew J. FlannerySure, Rob, it's Matt. So to your point, it takes time to get everything done. We always start with the people, first and foremost, make sure we secure everybody, get them comfortable with their jobs, and we train them on the systems, make sure everybody is working on the same operating system. All that's been done. So that's the front end and always isn't any deal we do. From there, we start working through the fleet and then any kind of branch changes, whether it's consolidations, whether we're repurposing any facilities, and we'll continue to work through fleet and facilities through the balance of this year. So we've got the game plan. It's just a matter of execution, and we're working through that. And then as far as margins in the maturation, I'll let Ted talk to it, but I wouldn't expect us to be fully mature certainly by year one. We've done some work in this in the past with other deals. But Ted, you may want to add to call?William GraceYes, Rob, it's a good question, and it kind of gets to some of the margin dynamics in the quarter that this is a good chance to kind of get those out there. So if you were to look at the equipment rental gross margin, on an as-reported basis, it would look like it was down 140 basis points year-on-year. That's a slight improvement from the down 170 in the first quarter. So you can see some of those benefits playing through there. But importantly, on a pro forma basis, our gross margin actually expanded 20 basis points.So you can see that impact of Ahern just putting the year ago period into the numbers. So we've got margin expansion there. And if you adjust for the increase in depreciation related to the assets the valuation of the acquired assets, gross margins were actually up 80 basis points in the equipment rental gross margin line. That includes the drag that we're talking about from this ongoing investment and fleet which we talked about last quarter continuing this quarter. I think it's reasonable to it will continue in the second half as we get that fleet up to our standards and other investments we're making that do get expensed and things like facilities. So to us, things are playing out very well, even in spite of these additional costs that are hitting us from a P&amp;L perspective, and you can see that in these numbers I just shared.Robert Cameron WertheimerOkay. Perfect. And if I can sneak in one more. I guess the normalization of supply chain means you and others are able to get fleet kind of more when you want it versus when you thought and maybe some of that plus some of the better margins you're getting on sale used equipment has led to the net rental CapEx coming in a little bit. Any relation of that to end market demand?I mean are you still seeing strength in every vertical and everything? Is there any tie between those 2 ideas and I'll stop there.Matthew J. FlanneryYes, sure. Thanks. So first off, let's be clear, supply chain is not fully remedied, which is why we front-load CapEx so much in the first half of this year, right? So we're at 60% of our full year spend. We're at the top end of the range we had talked about in that 55 to 60. And if we could have pulled in some more upfront in specific categories, we probably would have. We had said at the beginning of the year, we didn't really think there was an opportunity to pull CapEx forward. This is a decision that probably we'd make in Q4 if we're going to raise CapEx, that would really have to say more about what next year's slots look like.And if we can get back to a more normalized cadence, when the supply chain hopefully remedies in its entirety. So this change in net CapEx is just strictly about us having the opportunity to sell more fleet through the retail channel. And we're talking 90 months old fleet at $0.07 on the dollar is just smart business. It's time for that stuff to rotate out, and we wanted to normalize that. So there if we could have pulled some more forward to maybe make that net CapEx number more whole, we may have done it in the right categories. We just didn't really add that option because the supply chain is getting better, but not 100% there yet. Hopefully, that answers your question.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.Steven FisherSo I understand that some of the lower utilization you're seeing is by design because you're running too hot and your product availability wasn't where you wanted to be to serve some of those key customers you mentioned. But would you say -- to what extent are your service levels now back to where you like them to be.And so that sort of intentional lower utilization has now run its course? Or do you still think you need to have more slack in the system by design?Matthew J. FlanneryNo, I think we're at a comfortable level. Listen, we're going to continue to improve utilization over the long-term trend. It was just -- we haven't had a normal year in 3 years, right? So when you think about the COVID year, which was just goofy overall. And then the 2 years of just not being able to get fleet at the proper cadence. We'll revert back to continuing to try to drive better metrics from '19 on, as we had always done. So I'm not saying we're capped out. I'm just saying right now, especially with continuing to work through the Ahern fleet. We're on a pretty healthy time utilization, and we are being able to be responsive to these major opportunities we have with big customers on big projects. So that's how I categorize that, Steve.Steven FisherOkay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the rental gross margin trajectory, so you had a 170 basis point year-over-year decline in Q1 on a reported basis and 140 basis points in Q2. It's a little narrower decline. Should we extrapolate that pace? Or should that drag get smaller at a faster pace and maybe even really kind of just ends this year, and so that by the start of next year, you're growing your gross margins on a year-over-year basis. How should we think about that sort of trajectory?William GraceYes. So we do our best not to guide to kind of gross margins. But certainly, directionally, we would expect it to continue heading in the right direction. There's going to be a gap there structurally because that was a less profitable business than what we would have on a legacy basis, right? So and we've talked about that. I think on an LTM basis, their EBITDA margins were 35%, whereas ours were 48%.And so that will obviously be a dynamic in these as reported numbers. But certainly, that gap should narrow. And then as we get to next year, I think it would definitely be reasonable to assume that we'd be looking for margin expansion across the business.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities.Seth Robert WeberMaybe, Ted, just following up on your margin comment answer. SG&amp;A was surprisingly good this quarter. It was down sequentially on a dollar basis, a great leverage as a percentage of revenue. Is there still more operating leverage to come on the SG&amp;A line for the company here going forward? Or as good as it gets?William GraceSo here, again, this is an example of things we don't typically guide toward. So I want to be careful there. It's all embedded within the EBITDA and EBITDA margin and flow-through guidance we've given. So certainly, we would expect to continue driving very good efficiency there. But in terms of kind of trying to get people more precise hand holding, it's just not something we've done.So I don't know if that helps, Seth, but we feel really good about it, and certainly, we would expect to continue to be very efficient.Seth Robert WeberOkay. Maybe, Matt, just to I appreciate all the color on legal (inaudible) all that stuff. Maybe just a bigger picture question on the industry supply we've heard a few different -- some of your competitors have reported recently. Some companies are raising CapEx, some are moderating CapEx. Can you just talk to what you think kind of industry supply looks like industry utilization looks like Yes, just leave it there, I guess.Matthew J. FlanneryYes. I think -- so let's talk about the large companies, which we all get a little more information from. I think we're in a similar boat. I think you'll hear from most on that this is still a good demand environment, still a good solid rate environment. And I think that points to the industry discipline. And I think not everybody has reported yet, but I think everybody has had the same challenge at that time was just running a little too hot, and I think you're seeing people remedy that.I think a lot of us that had the ability to, so specifically the big guys that had some scale to leverage front load of their capital to try to bring it in ahead of the demand curve, so you didn't get stuck in that same box we are in for the last year or 2. So I think the dynamics in the industry are really solid. And I think you're going to hear -- we already have heard a couple report similar trends to what we're talking about. So we think the industry is in good shape. We think supply/demand is in good shape, historically strong time utilizations and that it's a solid rate environment. So good all the way around.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.Jerry David RevichI'm wondering if we could just expand on that comment you made a moment ago. So if we look back 2015, '16, where there was a time utilization soft spot and rising used equipment inventories and new equipment inventories. The industry gave back some price and what we're seeing from you folks and others is actually better price in 2Q than in 1Q. So can you just talk about the distinctions now versus then? How big of a factor is availability of rouse market-by-market information. Any other significant distinctions that are driving the much better industry discipline today versus 7 years ago?Matthew J. FlannerySure. To be specific, if you remember that 2015 was that oil and gas dislocation, right, which really drove kind of a double bit, we'll call a rate problem because it was the highest value of rate and just about every company's portfolio that was serving at rates were really high there and it went away quickly across the board. But your point is still fair. That was what happened when there was too much fleet in the system. The time you then dropped to levels that make people have to make different decisions.The time now in the industry is very healthy. So even though it's dropped from inflated time utilization, the reason why you're seeing different behavior is part industry discipline, but also everybody is running at healthy time utilizations. People are able to make good returns, good margins at these utilization levels and the price of goods is higher, so people understand the necessity for rate. So I think it's a totally different dynamic and that's important to note because some people may be reading through the drop in time utilizations that are reported is a demand problem. That's not the case whatsoever. So thanks for helping make that point.Jerry David RevichAnd in terms of just a natural implication of that, right, if we're not going to be looking to gear up in the first quarter as hard as an industry in '24. Obviously, you're not giving '24 guidance yet, but just the implication of that is lower year-over-year CapEx for the industry in the first half of '24. Just mathematically to tie all that together, given how we're running in the first half of '23. Is that reasonable way to pull these pieces together?Matthew J. FlanneryMaybe normalized cadence. I wouldn't say lower, but we're not even sure of that yet, right? We've got to get these slots from the OEMs. They have to be able to make the commitments. I know they're working hard. I know you talk to these folks as well, they're hopeful that supply chain will remedy. But I wouldn't go all the way there yet, but hopefully, hopefully, that's what happens, and we can get a little more of a normalized cadence and not have to hold stuff through the winter because we're afraid we can't get it in the spring.But either way, we're going to do what we need to do for our customers, right, not manage the metric more than the business and the output through the P&amp;L.Jerry David RevichAppreciate the discussion.OperatorOur next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.Jamie Lyn CookA nice quarter. I mean most of my questions have been answered. But first, just on what your customers are saying about 2024, any implications for how their -- how it will work with you going forward. So if we have above average visibility do they want to lock in business with you earlier and have sort of longer-term contracts to make sure they're able to capitalize on the multiyear spend that's out there? Or with supply chain getting better? Do you feel like customers potentially could get less sticky because they know there's going to be more equipment out there in the market? And then my second question, specialty margins continue to improve year-over-year. I'm assuming that's the trajectory for the back half of the year? And is there any opportunity on the M&amp;A front and specialty, that would be more M&amp;A.Matthew J. FlanneryI'll take the first part of that, Jamie, and Ted could talk to the specialty side. So big customers are still concerned, especially major projects, still concerned about making sure they have surety of supply. Right? Even though it's a small amount of spend, right, a couple of percentage points of spend on the project, it has major implications when they can't get the material and the labor activated.So we're having those conversations and a lot of the projects we're talking about today kick off this year and will carry in through next year, and they all hit different phases. So we're in regular planning with our large customers on these mega projects because it's really important to them. And they felt the crunch over the last couple of years and they want to make sure that surety of supply is there.So it's definitely more that way than thinking they can wait. I think the last 2 years, in some ways, it's better for us planning more with our big customers because they realize it's an important factor to making sure we both have a win-win situation. And Ted, do you want to touch on the second part?William GraceYes, quickly, Jamie, I just want to be sure I understood the question. It sounded like there are 3. Matt answered the first I heard the second half margins, I didn't know if that was a general question or specific to specialty. And the third, it sounded like the outlook for specialty M&amp;A?Jamie Lyn CookYes, the question was specific, especially both in terms of margin and both in terms of M&amp;A opportunity. So here again, it's all kind of embedded in the guidance we've given. So we do our best not to get into kind of giving specific guidance by segment per unit. So certainly, as you've heard us say, we feel very good about the way the business is performing and the outlook for margins in the second half, and that would be true on both sides of the business. I'm not sure I can be any more specific.In terms of the outlook for M&amp;A, both broadly and within specialty. It remains a very robust market. You've seen kind of what we've done year-to-date, and we continue to be active shoppers. In terms of success, that's harder to say. Discipline is always job #1 for us when we're allocating capital. So we're hopeful and optimistic that we'll have some things to do in the back half in M&amp;A more generally, but certainly within specialty as well. Matt, anything you'd add on that front?Matthew J. FlanneryNo, no. I think you covered it. I mean you folks all know we're very acquisitive and opportunistic, but we're going to make sure it meets that high bar that we have.OperatorOur next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup.Timothy W. TheinI just first Matt, I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on fleet productivity. I realize you don't love dissecting all these pieces, but I just wanted to follow up, just from a mix perspective, as you talk about -- I realize there are multiple pieces and components that go into that. But as you cycle more of that Ahern fleet out of the business, and you're refreshing the fleet as you talked about. Does that continue to be -- presumably that just given the inflation that we've seen recently in that product category that they were so big in Aerials. Does that act as a headwind into '24? Or just and again, I know I'm not looking for super granularity on this. But I'm just thinking from a high level, does that continue to drag on that fleet productivity? Or does that start to fade away?Matthew J. FlanneryNo, not more significant than what we do within our own fleet, right? So we're always going to manage inflation. That's why we track fleet productivity. But I think you'd have to imagine that our buying power was a little bit better. So some of those OECs and that's why you have part of the difference between as reported and pro forma.Some of those OECs are pumped up a little higher than seen by as well as us. So there's a little bit of a trade-off there to replace, so it won't be incrementally -- the replacement won't be incrementally as high as it would be maybe on one of our own assets that was 9 years old or 8 years old. So nothing that we'd call out, nothing that we can't manage through in the normal course of business.Timothy W. TheinOkay. All right. And then maybe just a bigger picture, a fair amount of disruption that's occurred to the regional or the banking system over the last several months. And there's more concerns around just lending availability and do some of these regional banks tighten up. Again, nothing that you haven't heard.But I'm just curious, as your conversations with fellow C-suite folks. Is that -- are you hearing or seeing much from a standpoint of projects that maybe were on your drawing board that are pushing out? Or anything that you would flag along one line. Obviously, it's been a concern for some recently. I'm just curious if that's -- if it's something that you're seeing or hearing much of that.Matthew J. FlanneryNo. As a matter of fact, our project pipeline remains robust. We're not seeing cancellations. We talked about delays on some solar projects that was more supply chain related, and we actually think those are coming back on quicker than they were, which is good news. But when we look at mega projects overall, right, you can decide how you define a mega project, is it -- whether it's $400 million, $500 million, $600 million worth of value. These are all up significantly. And we're talking, depending on which cut you use, somewhere between 70 and over 100%.So doubling the size of these amount of projects. And that's what the pipeline looks like right now. So we actually feel really good about the pipeline. We haven't seen any deterioration because of any kind of financing or interest issues. Ted, you might want to add something.William GraceYes. So I guess things I'd add, you said regional banks, but I think it's more specific to the local smaller banks. But frankly, we're not seeing it either level. I mean as best we can tell capital availability remains abundant for our customers. Cost of capital remains reasonable. And so if we look at our customer confidence, really going back to the middle of March when all this started, it's really unaffected. And if we look at our performance by customer segment, right, so you look at national accounts strategic, assigned local, et cetera. You're not seeing any real difference in how those are performing.So certainly, on the -- through the second quarter, there's no discernible impact. And in terms of what the potential may be going forward, our customers aren't really talking about it, and we're not sensing it's an issue, but it's something we're obviously watching closely as you'd expect.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Kenneth H. NewmanMatt, so obviously, it sounds like you feel very confident in the demand environment here. I am curious. Can you just give a little bit of color on what you're seeing between your 2 customer sets, right? Because obviously, your internal sentiment survey seems like it's still pretty strong or in line with last quarter which is, I think, more ties to your national accounts, but any signs of material moves between your national accounts and your local accounts?Matthew J. FlanneryNo, not anything that we're seeing. Now we don't do a lot of Harry homeowner type, weekend warrior type work. So I don't know what that segment is doing. We definitely skew more towards the contractor and large contractor. But we're not seeing any delineation in our local market business versus our big job business. We're actually in pretty good shape. We talked about that when we were talking about the non-res numbers earlier. So we're -- that's 1 of the areas where you would think it would show up, and it's not -- we're actually not seeing any delineation. And we're not seeing it in the customer confidence index results as well.Kenneth H. NewmanAnd then just to follow up on that nonres comment. Obviously, you talked about industrial manufacturing demand being strong here in the quarter. Nonres, I think you said was up double digits. I'm curious if you could just dissect that a little bit. I mean I didn't hear too much about civil infrastructure projects. And my understanding is that starting to accelerate here in the last couple of months. Is that a category that you're expecting to accelerate here into the back half? And if so, how do we think about the margin impact on some of those projects, if any, here for the back half of '23.William GraceYes, Ken, I'll take that one. So it's not one of those things that's easy to track, as you know. I would say intuitively, yes, we do expect a lot of the civil projects that are funded by the infrastructure bill and prospectively, the inflation reduction act to start gaining momentum in terms of exactly what that cadence looks like. It would be great if there were a schedule. We have not found one. But certainly, the outlook for infrastructure is positive, right? You've got north of $1.5 trillion of spend over the next 10 years, let's say, and spend that we are very well positioned for given Matt has made this comment in his prepared remarks, but the strategy we've developed over the last 10 years is unique and puts us in a great position to be the most value-added partner to the contractors that are executing those projects.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerI'm going to follow up that last nonres question. A common question we feel is about weak spots within nonres. And everything we've heard on this call becomes very, very good across nonres. So one of the areas of concern is commercial real estate, nonmanufacturing and office buildings. Any insight you can share there or any other areas of weakness, Matt. It just sounds like it's very broad-based and very good. I just want to hone in on any trouble points that you might be seeing.Matthew J. FlanneryYes. No, and I know Ted has done some work on this stat. I mean, we all know what the vacancy rates are, and we know those are issues, but I don't know that, that was ever a real big part of our business, right, is vertical versus horizontal is usually a bigger rental need as opposed to vertical, but Ted may have some information to share.William GraceYes. And certainly, if you look at what we call nonres, it continues to grow quite nicely. We don't get as granular as the questions you're asking. So if you were to look at the construction put in place data, Scott, certainly looking at office and commercial, whether it's year-to-date or I think June, which is the most recent data, they both continue to show growth. Now I think you're asking more on a forward-looking basis.And when we think about that, and we have in total those 2 verticals are about 20% of total nonres construction put in place. And I'd say the office part is one people worry about, given return to office and work from home and those things. Commercial is a huge segment. So it's not strip malls wherever people live. It's much broader. But I think those are the 2 areas that we've talked about being reasonably at risk. Now then you talk about the areas where we see -- where we are optimistic where we see strong pipelines and where you continue to see strong growth. And the ones you'd highlight would be manufacturing, as we've talked about, public road and highway, power, communication, transportation and healthcare.All of which are performing well. In total, those are 55% of total nonres. And our contention would be the growth in those markets is really going to offset any headwinds we would reasonably anticipate in the office commercial combination. So that is logically what drives our optimism looking out across the back half of this year and going forward.Scott Andrew SchneebergerGreat. That's the answer I was looking for. Appreciate it. For just a quick follow-up on specialty rental, could you speak a little bit to the asset categories? It sounds like things have been going very well, and it sounds like that's broad-based as well. But just curious if anyone is lagging behind as the category or pulling ahead? And also any commentary on GFN, the old goal was to double that within 5 years. Just an update now that we're 2 years past that the close of that acquisition, where that stands?Matthew J. FlanneryYes. So for the first part of your question, nobody has fallen behind, as I said in the prepared remarks, Specialty had 17% organic growth and all the business segments were in double digits, which is great. Now certainly, the GFN, which you pointed to, is growing a little bit faster than the rest, but we would expect that. And as far as that goal to double the size of the business in 5 years. I think we shared this earlier in the year that we're ahead of schedule.Whether we're a year ahead of schedule or 2 years ahead of schedule, time will tell, but we're very pleased with where they are, and we're continuing to open coal start to continuing to grow that sector as well. But we're growing all of our specialty segments. We're really pleased with the work the team is doing there.OperatorOur next question comes from Neil Tyler with Redburn.Neil Christopher TylerTwo last, please. Firstly, on the topic of CapEx and availability, one of your competitors floated the notion that ticket prices, OEC ticket prices had been sort of inflated recently by things like surcharges that should or may well fall away if availability improves. I don't know if that's a perspective I'd like to hear your perspective on whether that's a likelihood or a certainty or not a notion that you're considering, first of all, please?Matthew J. FlannerySure. So we don't talk about our negotiations on open mic, just we're one of the good partners with our vendors. But the comment of some of the surcharges and the costs associated with creating those surcharges is certainly a fair comment when we're discussing with our partners. So I don't think that characterization is wrong. We just don't really talk about our negotiations with our partners publicly but the characterization is fair one.Neil Christopher TylerGreat. That's still helpful. And then just -- apologies, but I want to just quickly come back to the time you comments you made earlier, just so I understand this. The lower year-on-year time you split between timing of fleet arrivals and a deliberate move to normalize time and am I right thinking that the first of those 2 categories is more or less behind us and the second will persist for the rest of the year. Is that fair?Matthew J. FlanneryYes. I mean the first enabled us to do the second, right? If we can bring in the fleet, we wouldn't be able to tamp it down. So they're very much going hand-in-hand. But just by definition of how much capital we have left for the year versus growth, we're going to bring in a good amount of our CapEx in Q3 here, as you would expect for the balance of the -- what's left in the balance of the year. And and I think, like I said earlier, when people are trying to see if we could forecast the productivity number, we'll sequentially grow, but we think you're going to see similar year-over-year dynamics to what we saw in Q2. So we feel good about it. We feel good about the demand and we'll continue to have CapEx rolling here in Q3.OperatorOur final question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.Mircea DobreA lot has been covered here, but maybe on the topic of nonres, Ted, I appreciate it, all the context you provided, but I wanted to sort of ask a hypothetical question. If we're looking at private nonres this year, they put in place is growing north of 20%. If growth slows in 2024, right, tougher comps or maybe some of the pockets that weakness that people are worried about.And we're talking about growth reverting back to low to mid-single digit. What does that mean in terms of how you're going to manage your business? How do you manage fleet in terms of CapEx, disposals? And again, I'm not asking for guidance. I'm just trying to understand hypothetically how you would react to something like that.William GraceYes. It's a good question, Mig. It's something we go through every year. So of course, we're talking in nominal dollars. So you've really got to convert this all to volume. But that's how we approach the forward year as it relates to CapEx as we get into the fall and into the fourth quarter, we'll start our bottoms-up planning process. That process will help us get a much better sense for what our customers think their growth will look like at '24. At that point, we can then think about what our replacement CapEx needs will be based on the OEC we plan to sell next year. And then the incremental fleet, we need to support growth in that environment. As Matt said, we think we've kind of reset the baseline back to where we want to be this year. So as we think about next year, let's just say we're kind of at that steady state, then there's less of a time dynamic that comes into this and then it's more a function of how do you manage the growth in your OEC. Matt, is that fair?Mircea DobreYes. No, I think you've heard it well.Matthew J. FlanneryMig does that answer your question?Mircea DobreWell, it helps. I'm still kind of scratching my head on the fact that you're going to be exiting the year with significant year-over-year growth in fleet, right? So if growth slows, does that mean that you're sort of pivoting towards just pure replacement CapEx? Or you're still in fleet growth mode? That's what I was trying to tease out.Matthew J. FlanneryYes. And it's a fair question, but it will depend on what we see as a demand as we go through our planning process. But we're certainly not as negative on the growth as maybe the tone you're sharing. But you know what, time will tell, and we're going to adjust and manage the business appropriately for whatever environment we have. All that being said, we do expect, and I think you're seeing this with most of the big players for us to outpace overall industry growth. We think the big getting bigger is a dynamic that will continue to play. And I would say the type of work that we've talked a lot about to everyone lends itself to the larger players. So I wouldn't even if there is a slower growth in the overall industry, we think we'll have the ability to outpace that. But I do get your point, and we'll manage through it.William GraceAnd that's the thing about doing it at year-end is we'll know what that carryover growth in capacity is, which allows us then to factor that into whatever our CapEx spend will be -- all right. This gets back to continuing to be very good stewards of our shareholders' capital.OperatorThank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Matt Flannery for any additional or closing remarks.Matthew J. FlanneryThanks, operator, and no additional remarks. That wraps it up for today. So I want to thank everyone for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you all again in late October. And in the meantime, please feel free to reach out to Elizabeth at any time if you have any questions. Thanks again. Operator, please go ahead and end the call.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.]"

On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased courtesy of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.Moreover, URI has lifted its guidance for 2023, given the strength of the present market condition and the multi-year tailwinds the company sees across infrastructure, manufacturing, and energy and power.However, shares dropped 3.6% in the after-hours trading session on Jul 26, following second-quarter 2023 results. Most likely, investors were less optimistic after the Fed policymakers raised their main interest rate by a quarter-point to a 5.25%-5.5% target range yesterday.Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with an annualized yield of approximately 1.3%.

The Used equipment sales produced an adjusted gross margin of 57.3%, which contracted 490 basis points (bps).

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable industries, you can go directly to 10 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market Cap.The most valuable companies in the world operate within various industries, including technology, energy, healthcare, financial services, and communication services. It is important to note that some of the technology and energy companies are listed as the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Many of these biggest companies have had to deal with a number of hurdles in the past few years, such as recessionary fears, overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, needs and demands of the employees, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine.In one of our previous articles, 25 largest energy companies by market cap, we discussed how the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly, causing oil prices to surge. However, according to an article published by CNBC on March 3, new data shows that the war in Ukraine has actually helped the US oil and gas industry as the US became one of the biggest energy-exporting countries. The US exported an average ten million barrels a day during the four-week period, which ended on February 24.In addition to the energy sector, the information technology industry also ranks among the biggest industries in the world. In fact, some of the most valuable companies in our list, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), all belong to the technology sector. Let's discuss what the future of  the technology industry looks like before we move on to the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.The Information Technology Sector on Track to Hit $12 Trillion By 2027Previously, the information technology industry had been subjected to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis. While the supply chain disruptions are back due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry is expected to continue growing in the long term. The information technology market was valued above $8.85 trillion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2023 through 2027, to reach a value of around $11.99 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe technology industry has become one of the biggest industries in the world and has also perhaps been the most consequential over the last couple of decades. In the modern day, technology has changed the way we live our lives and consumer demand for more technology continues to rise.As an obvious consequence, technology companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap. According to an article posted by Reuters on July 1, the market cap for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above the $3 trillion mark for the first time. This milestone follows the company’s launch of a mixed-reality headset.Moreover, the rising demand for tools powered by artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing services is expected to help boost the profits for technology companies. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appreciates the potential of both AI and cloud services as they offer their products and services, including Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing platform, to some of the biggest enterprises around the world. Here are some comments from the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call:“We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.”On February 8, Reuters had reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be rolling out an AI chatbot to operate alongside Bing's search results, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to challenge Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in search and browser technology.The AI war got ignited when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company we all know from ChatGPT.While Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google was previously at a disadvantage with regards to generative AI, but favorable demand trends for AI tools caused the company to take a big step forward. On May 12, Forbes reported that Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google had announced that their AI chatbot “Bard” is open to all and that the users will soon experience a completely new “search generation experience”.On July 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted market-beating earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.44 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.10. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $74.60 billion, up 7.06% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $1.85 billion.Now that we have discussed what's been happening in one of the most valuable industries in the world, let's take a look at some of the most valuable companies in the world, by market cap.50 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market CapCopyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this article, we will be looking at the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.

350,917ecf64-1654-411c-ab7b-584132e7e74c,ORCL,2023-07-28,AWS this week unveiled a generative AI scribe for docs. The competition is fierce.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aws-this-week-unveiled-a-generative-ai-scribe-for-docs-the-competition-is-fierce-165700659.html,1690477020,STORY,"['MSFT', 'ORCL', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'MMM', 'AMZN']","[Amazon Web Services (AMZN) is launching a new medical tool to help doctors cut down on the time spent adding notes to patient records — a tedious task that often stretches doctors' hours through the evening.The announcement on Wednesday, at the annual AWS Summit New York, signals another way the tech and e-commerce giant is focused on the healthcare space, but it is separate from the Amazon Health business.AWS HealthScribe is the latest version of a transcription service the company already has on the market. What's new: The new model can summarize discussions, track multiple speakers, enter information into electronic health records, and pull out key medical information, such as terms and medications. Those are all things physicians and their staff have to do on their own if they're using basic transcription services or simply taking notes.""Every sentence used in the AI-generated clinical notes comes with references to the original doctor-patient conversation transcripts, and the service does not retain any customer data after processing the customer [clinician's] request,"" AWS said in a statement.The cost of the service is ""substantially less"" than the $30,000 to $50,000 per year it takes to hire a personal scribe — a common practice in many emergency rooms, for example.That's according to Detlef Koll, vice president of global R&amp;D at 3M (MMM) Health Information Systems and one of the first customers to use the AWS scribe tool. 3M provides medical devices to companies as well as health record management software. 3M and virtual health provider Babylon Health were at the Summit to promote the new tool.The medical transcription software market has been growing steadily over the years along with the technology. It is projected to be a $190 billion market by 2032.Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of database, analytics, and machine learning at AWS, announces HealthScribe yesterday.What are 'scribes'?Scribes are commonly found in ERs as well as outpatient clinics, but Amazon's new tool is focusing on general medicine and orthopedics, areas of doctor shortages, the company said Wednesday.Story continues""This is a scalability issue. If you put a scribe for every physician practice in the US, that would be too expensive,"" Koll said.But if a transcription tool can automate the process at a lower price, it can save up to three hours of work per physician, Koll said.HealthScribe was created using Amazon Bedrock, AWS's service to build generative AI-powered apps. It will respond to prompts by generating text, images, audio, and synthetic data — similar to OpenAI.AWS has been building out its healthcare offerings. These include HealthLake, which allows medical organizations to store data and make it searchable; Imaging, which helps with storing and processing CT scans and the like; and Omics, which is geared to life sciences companies and stores and searches genomics data.Tehsin Syed, general manager for Health AI at AWS, warned, however, that the technology, while impressive, is still developing. For example, summaries produced by HealthScribe are still reviewed by doctors, who can either accept or reject them.""I don't think we're ready to hand anything off [completely to machines] at the moment,"" Syed told Yahoo Finance. ""But we're much closer to very interesting and exciting experiences.""AWS HealthScribeA new waveUsing a scribe in medicine isn't a new concept. It first came into existence in the mid-1990s. But it has since been slowly becoming more tech-enabled.In a field crowded with startups, Big Tech is now a major player.California-based ScribeAmerica is the only non-Big Tech player that is a major brand, with its proprietary software. It has been in the space for two decades and offers an AI tool, Speke, which also provides summaries of transcribed patient visits. Microsoft (MSFT) markets its Dragon Medical One through one of the biggest electronic health record (EHR) providers, Epic, giving it a market advantage. Oracle (ORCL) sells its Transcription tool through the other leading EHR provider, Cerner, which it acquired in 2021. Google's Cloud (GOOG) also offers a medical transcription product.But the technology is still in its early days, and ""we have to figure out how to deploy this technology in a responsible way so that we don't create operational risks for our customers, for health care organizations,"" 3M's Koll said.Dr. Bill Fera, a principal at Deloitte, told Yahoo Finance that the space has been gaining momentum in the past three to four years. ""I think now, with generative AI, it has become a real opportunity, and we see continued activity and explosion in this space,"" Fera said.The three biggest hurdles to broader adoption are requiring physicians to review the summaries and transcriptions, the cost of the tools which can be prohibitive for smaller providers, and the silos created by tech companies, known as lack of interoperability, which has been an ongoing problem in the digital health space.AWS's tool can plug into any system, Syed said, which could help the interoperability problem.But there is still a learning curve. And what data is put into the systems that are learning and improving is paramount, said Vijay Kedar, CEO of healthtech startup Tomorrow Health.""We need to ensure quality isn't compromised as these algorithms continue to learn and scale,"" he said.Dr. Elliott Trotter, an emergency medicine physician in Texas, co-founded PhysAssist Medical Scribes in 1995, which was later acquired by ScribeAmerica in 2018 and has been dubbed the founder of the modern-day scribe.He told Yahoo Finance that it is frustrating that in 2023 there still isn't a perfect solution available to make physicians' lives easier. It's why tech companies, some of which he says he is advising, should not forget to focus on the people as they continue to develop these capabilities.""It's sort of been barely moving, that technology, for quite a while. Now we're at the precipice of it really taking off. So just really making sure that everyone knows where the potential downfalls are, and to think those processes through very carefully,"" he said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(NYSE: MTD) today announced second quarter results for 2023. Provided below are the highlights:Reported sales were flat compared with the prior-year. In local currency, sales increased 2% in the quarter as currency reduced sales growth by 2%.Net earnings per diluted share as reported (EPS) were $9.69, compared with $9.29 in the prior-year period. Adjusted EPS was $10.19, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $9.39. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to EPS is included on the last page of the attached schedules.Second Quarter ResultsPatrick Kaltenbach, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""Sales growth in the second quarter included strong growth in our Service business, as well as solid performance across our Industrial product categories, which was offset in part by softer market conditions in Laboratory and China following very strong growth over the last couple of years. Focused execution of our margin expansion and disciplined cost control initiatives resulted in good growth in Adjusted EPS despite a very significant adverse foreign exchange impact.""GAAP ResultsEPS in the quarter was $9.69, compared with the prior-year amount of $9.29.Compared with the prior-year, total reported sales were flat at $982.1 million. By region, reported sales increased 1% in both the Americas and Europe, and decreased 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Earnings before taxes amounted to $263.4 million, compared with $256.7 million in the prior-year.Non-GAAP ResultsAdjusted EPS was $10.19, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $9.39.Compared with the prior-year, total sales in local currency increased 2% as currency reduced sales growth by 2%. By region, local currency sales increased 4% in Asia/Rest of World, 1% in the Americas, and were flat in Europe. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to $307.7 million, an 8% increase from the prior-year amount of $285.4 million.Story continuesAdjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the attached schedules.Six Month ResultsGAAP ResultsEPS was $18.15, compared with the prior-year amount of $16.84.Compared with the prior-year, total reported sales increased 2% to $1,910.9 million. By region, reported sales increased 3% in the Americas, 2% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Earnings before taxes amounted to $490.0 million, compared with $469.7 million in the prior-year.Non-GAAP ResultsAdjusted EPS was $18.82, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $17.25.Compared with the prior-year, total sales in local currency increased 4% as currency reduced sales growth by 2%. By region, local currency sales increased 3% in both the Americas and in Europe, and 6% in Asia/Rest of World. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to $574.2 million, a 9% increase from the prior-year amount of $526.7 million.OutlookThe Company stated that forecasting remains challenging. Management cautions that market conditions are dynamic and changes to the business environment can occur quickly. There is increased uncertainty in the economic environment today, including the risk of recession in many countries, and management acknowledges that market conditions are subject to change.Based on today's assessment of market conditions, management anticipates local currency sales for the third quarter of 2023 will decline approximately 3% to 4%, and Adjusted EPS is forecast to be $9.55 to $9.85, a decline of 3% to 6%. Included in the third quarter guidance is an estimated 3% headwind to Adjusted EPS growth due to adverse currency.For the full year, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2023 will be approximately 0% to 1%, and Adjusted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $40.30 to $41.20, representing growth of approximately 2% to 4%. This compares with previous local currency sales growth guidance of approximately 5% and Adjusted EPS guidance of $43.65 to $43.95. Included in the 2023 guidance is an estimated 3% to 4% headwind to Adjusted EPS growth due to adverse currency.While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known.ConclusionKaltenbach concluded, ""As we look to the remainder of 2023, there is increased uncertainty in the global economy and our end markets, and we continue to face challenging sales growth comparisons. Market demand in China has deteriorated sharply, and we expect reduced sales during the remainder of 2023. We remain confident in the factors we can control, including executing on our best-in-class sales and marketing programs and our margin expansion and proactive cost savings initiatives. Our team remains very agile in adapting to changing market conditions, and I am confident that our efforts will deliver good financial results this year in a more challenging business environment.""Other MattersThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its quarterly results today (Thursday, July 27) at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted for certain items, increased 5% to $2.76 on a diluted basis, including an unfavorable impact of $0.05 per share if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates (""foreign currency translation""), compared to $2.63 in the prior year period. Certain items that impacted second quarter results and comparisons with the prior year period are detailed in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income, Operating Margin and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Story continues""Our global team delivered strong operating results in the second quarter, including  6% organic revenue growth and 110 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, demonstrating the strength of our Aon United strategy and ongoing progress against our financial goals,"" said Greg Case, Chief Executive Officer. ""By aligning solution development around Risk Capital and Human Capital, we're accelerating innovation in our core business and more effectively leveraging our Aon Business Services platform to address growing client demand for analytical tools that will help them make better decisions on risk and people challenges and opportunities.""SECOND QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL SUMMARYTotal revenue in the second quarter increased 7% to $3.2 billion compared to the prior year period reflecting 6% organic revenue growth and a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Total operating expenses in the second quarter increased 2% to $2.3 billion compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth and investments in long-term growth, partially offset by a $10 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Foreign currency translation in the second quarter had an $11 million, or $0.05 per share, unfavorable impact on U.S. GAAP net income and a $10 million, or $0.05 per share, unfavorable impact on adjusted net income. If currency were to remain stable at today's rates, the Company would expect no impact in the third quarter of 2023, and an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.14 per share, or an approximately $42 million decrease in adjusted operating income for full year 2023.Effective tax rate was 12.6% in the second quarter compared to 18.8% in the prior year period. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 17.6% compared to 19.3% in the prior year period. The primary drivers of the change in the adjusted tax rate were the geographical distribution of income and a net favorable impact from discrete items.Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased to 206.3 million in the second quarter compared to 214.7 million in the prior year period. The Company repurchased 1.7 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $550 million in the second quarter. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $4.9 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.YEAR TO DATE 2023 CASH FLOW SUMMARYCash flows provided by operations for the first six months of 2023 was flat compared to the prior year period, primarily due to strong operating income growth offset in part by higher cash tax payments.Free cash flow, defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, decreased 7%, to $986 million for the first six months of 2023 compared to the prior year period, reflecting flat cash flows provided by operations and a $77 million increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were elevated in the first half of the year compared to the prior year period as we initiated a number of projects with spend heavily weighted in the first half across technology to drive long-term growth.SECOND QUARTER 2023 REVENUE REVIEWThe second quarter revenue reviews provided below include supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, which is a non-GAAP measure that is described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow"" on page 9 of this press release.Three Months Ended June 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: Currency ImpactLess: Fiduciary Investment IncomeLess: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue GrowthRevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$    1,774$    1,6925 %(1) %2 %(1) %5 %Reinsurance Solutions60753713(1)5—9Health Solutions4474148(1)—(1)10Wealth Solutions3523433——12Eliminations(3)(3)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$    3,177$    2,9837 %(1) %2 %— %6 % Total revenue increased $194 million, or 7%, to $3,177 million, compared to the prior year period, with organic revenue growth of 6%, driven by ongoing strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation, and a 2% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.Commercial Risk Solutions organic revenue growth of 5% reflects strong growth across most major geographies driven by strong retention, management of the renewal book, and net new business generation. Growth in retail brokerage was highlighted by double-digit growth in Asia and the Pacific, driven by continued strength in core P&amp;C. The U.S. grew modestly driven by strength in core businesses, partially offset by the impact of the external M&amp;A and IPO markets on M&amp;A services. Results also reflect strong growth globally in the affinity business across both consumer and business solutions. On average globally, exposures and pricing were positive, resulting in a modestly positive market impact.Reinsurance Solutions organic revenue growth of 9% reflects strong growth in treaty, driven by strong retention and continued net new business generation, as well as double-digit growth in both facultative placements and investment banking, and solid growth in the Strategy and Technology Group. Market impact was modestly positive on results in the quarter. The majority of revenue in our treaty portfolio is recurring in nature and is recorded in connection with the major renewal periods that take place throughout the first half of the year.Health Solutions organic revenue growth of 10% reflects strong growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage primarily from net new business generation and management of the renewal book. Strength in the core was highlighted by double-digit growth in Latin America, EMEA, and the U.K. Results also reflect modest growth in Talent, driven by data and advisory solutions.Wealth Solutions organic revenue growth of 2% reflects growth in Retirement, driven by advisory demand and project-related work related to pension de-risking and ongoing impact of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to equity market and interest rate movements was partially offset by advisory demand and project-related work.SECOND QUARTER 2023 EXPENSE REVIEWThree Months Ended June 30,(millions)20232022$ Change% ChangeExpensesCompensation and benefits$          1,754$          1,639$             1157 %Information technology1291151412Premises6873(5)(7)Depreciation of fixed assets3940(1)(3)Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2525——Other general expense320391(71)(18)Total operating expenses$          2,335$          2,283$               522 % Compensation and benefits expense increased $115 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, partially offset by an $8 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.Information technology expense increased $14 million, or 12%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms to drive long-term growth and continued investment in core infrastructure and security.Premises expense decreased $5 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a one-time $4 million benefit associated with steps taken to optimize our real estate footprint.Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $1 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year period.Amortization and impairment of intangible assets was flat compared to the prior year period.Other general expenses decreased $71 million, or 18%, compared to the prior year period due primarily to a $58 million charge in connection with certain legal settlements in the prior year period that did not repeat in the second quarter of 2023.SECOND QUARTER 2023 INCOME SUMMARYCertain noteworthy items impacted adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margins in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, which are also described in detail in ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income, Operating Margin and Diluted Earnings Per Share"" on page 10 of this press release.Three Months Ended June 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeRevenue$      3,177$      2,9837 %Expenses2,3352,2832 %Operating income$         842$         70020 %Operating margin26.5 %23.5 %Operating income - as adjusted$         867$         78311 %Operating margin - as adjusted27.3 %26.2 % Operating income increased $142 million, or 20%, and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 26.5%, each compared to the prior year period.

Organic revenue growth includes the impact of intercompany activity and excludes foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, fiduciary investment income, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations to the closest U.S. GAAP measure for each non-GAAP measure presented in this communication are provided in the attached appendices. Supplemental organic revenue growth information and additional measures that exclude the effects of certain items noted above do not affect net income or any other U.S. GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activity less capital expenditures. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for estimated intangible asset amortization and impairment, and certain other noteworthy items. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. Non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, Aon's Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.Investor Contact:Media Contact:Leslie FollmerNadine Youssef+1 312-381-3310+1 312-381-3024investor.relations@aon.commediainquiries@aon.com Aon plcCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,(millions, except per share data)20232022% Change20232022%ChangeRevenueTotal revenue$   3,177$   2,9837 %$   7,048$   6,6536 %ExpensesCompensation and benefits1,7541,6397 %3,5463,4064 %Information technology12911512 %26823813 %Premises6873(7) %143145(1) %Depreciation of fixed assets3940(3) %7778(1) %Amortization and impairment of intangible assets2525— %5053(6) %Other general expense320391(18) %649666(3) %Total operating expenses2,3352,2832 %4,7334,5863 %Operating income84270020 %2,3152,06712 %Interest income55— %10825 %Interest expense(130)(102)27 %(241)(193)25 %Other income (expense)(59)30(297) %(84)55(253) %Income before income taxes6586334 %2,0001,9373 %Income tax expense (1)83119(30) %346375(8) %Net income57551412 %1,6541,5626 %Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests151315 %443816 %Net income attributable to Aon shareholders$      560$      50112 %$   1,610$   1,5246 %Basic net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$     2.74$     2.3517 %$     7.84$     7.1110 %Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders$     2.71$     2.3316 %$     7.79$     7.0710 %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - basic204.7213.3(4) %205.4214.3(4) %Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding - diluted206.3214.7(4) %206.7215.6(4) %(1)The effective tax rate was 12.6% and 18.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 17.3% and 19.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Aon plcReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue Growth and Free Cash Flow (Unaudited)Organic Revenue Growth (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$    1,774$    1,6925 %(1) %2 %(1) %5 %Reinsurance Solutions60753713(1)5—9Health Solutions4474148(1)—(1)10Wealth Solutions3523433——12Elimination(3)(3)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$    3,177$    2,9837 %(1) %2 %— %6 % Six Months Ended June 30,(millions)20232022% ChangeLess: Currency Impact (1)Less: Fiduciary Investment Income (2)Less: Acquisitions, Divestitures &amp; OtherOrganic Revenue Growth (3)RevenueCommercial Risk Solutions$    3,552$    3,4114 %(2) %2 %(2) %6 %Reinsurance Solutions1,6841,51311(2)319Health Solutions1,1181,0526(2)—(1)9Wealth Solutions7026882(2)——4Elimination(8)(11)N/AN/AN/AN/AN/ATotal revenue$    7,048$    6,6536 %(2) %2 %(1) %7 %(1)Currency impact represents the effect on prior year period results if they were translated at current period foreign exchange rates.(2)Fiduciary investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $64 million and $7 million, respectively.

Never be left in the dust again.MetaMeta (NASDAQ:META) popped 4.4% Thursday after the company said it pocketed $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32 billion, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.Morgan Stanley was ebullient on the results, hiking Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share and writing:META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.Bernstein raved:They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.Shares closed at $311.71.AlphabetAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares jumped after the search giant surpassed second-quarter analyst expectations, saying Tuesday after the close that it earned $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6B, driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.Story continuesAnalysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search &amp; other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, saying: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.Shares jumped 5.8% on Wednesday.MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground Wednesday after reporting the company's CFO warned on the earnings call that CapEx is expected to increase over the next several quarters as the tech giant races to meet strong AI demand.“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood noted on the earnings call.For the Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to driving meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on the timing of when these stepped-up investments will pay off:Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and lost another 2% to $330.72 in the next session.BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA) numbers topped second-quarter estimates as the U.S. plane maker also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.The company posted a loss of $0.82 per share on Wednesday, but that was $0.08 narrower than expected, and revenue of $19.75B - up 18% year over year - comfortably exceeded the $18.49B consensus, per analysts polled by Investing.com. Sales were driven by higher deliveries of its 787 model, and Boeing's commercial airplanes segment registered a 41% revenue surge to $8.84B.Boeing also raised its production plans for the 737 MAX up to 38 per month from 31 by the end of the year, in a sign that the planes are in heavy demand as airlines race to address a post-pandemic surge in travel.BofA upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral on these results and raised its price target by $75 to $300, arguing that the ""worst is behind"" for the company ""in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels.""The analyst added:We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analyst said in a note.Boeing soared 8.7% to $232.80 Wednesday and was recently adding more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.McDonald'sMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) shares rose 1.2% to $295.19 Thursday after the fast food behemoth beat on the top and bottom line in the second quarter on strong same-store sales.EPS surged 97% to $3.15, said the company, trouncing the $2.78 average analyst estimate. Revenues rose 14% in constant currencies to $6.5B, edging out the $6.29B consensus.The company reported that global comparable sales rose 11.7% for the quarter, far better than Wall Street's call for an 8.88% increase. U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3%.U.S. sales were boosted by strategic menu price increases and positive guest counts, the company said.""Our second quarter results reflect consistently strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski was quoted as saying in the accompanying press release. ""While global macroeconomic challenges persist, we continue to invest in our growth drivers and our brand.""Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, Scott Kanowsky, and Sarina Isaacs contributed to this report._______Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Meta delights, Microsoft warns in huge week for tech, AIAdidas plans next Yeezy stock sale in AugustCharter Communications earnings missed by $0.02, revenue fell short of estimates]"

And now I'll turn it over to Chris.Story continuesChristopher J. KempczinskiThanks, Mike, and good morning. Last quarter, I talked about consistency, consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is -- well, if I'm being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere in the past few months, all over the news, and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald's today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double-digit comparable sales across each of our segments. We're operating from a position of strength and continuing to gain share in most of our major markets despite headwinds and a challenging macro environment.The reason for this continued consistency is simple, our accelerating the Arches playbook is working to help create a better customer experience. Renewed focus on the fundamentals, in part fueled by the reintroduction of the PACE program, has led to operational improvements and continued increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets.To further strengthen our foundation of running great restaurants, we recently created a Chief Restaurant Officer role in markets to keep our market teams focused on driving our strategic plan, execution, and performance. Market CROs will also help ensure that innovative ideas generated in local restaurants can be leveraged in markets across the globe. Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while evolving our strategy through accelerating the organization to stay front-footed with an eye towards the future.As we've previously shared, accelerating the organization is an initiative to reimagine how we work to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences together to come up with the best solutions that can be scaled. We're bringing this to life through, One McDonald's Way, horizontal ways of working and digitizing the organization. While we're just beginning to change our ways of working, we're already seeing early benefits. I've often said that the next great solution will come from our markets and in our restaurants. As I recently visited markets like China, Italy and Germany, I continue to be inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our system and how market teams are embracing these principles even more consistently.Visiting China truly brought to life the power of a highly digitized economy and our potential for global growth moving forward. With about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology. This will provide great learnings for the rest of our system.Our Canadian team is implementing a rigorous initiative review process to relentlessly prioritize work to actively stop projects that are less important and focus on solving the most meaningful problems for our customers. Using a new framework, the team has already cut their number of key business projects in half. We intend to learn from and scale this process to other markets as well. Additionally, our U.K. and Ireland team recently traveled to Germany to learn best practices from the market's best burger rollout. This is a prime example of the agile scaling of solutions and horizontal ways of working.And finally, last November, we launched our largest globally unified marketing campaign ever, Wanna Go to McDonald's? to celebrate the FIFA Men's World Cup. We're thrilled to extend this award-winning brand platform with the FIFA Women's World Cup and write a new chapter in the story to meet this iconic cultural moment. This campaign will be brought to life in 28 markets through fully integrated social, digital streaming and content strategies that tap into local fan excitement. These are just a few examples of how a One McDonald's Way approach to common challenges will drive greater connectivity and efficiency worldwide.Key to enabling the company's scale solutions with speed and agility is the work of our new Global Business Services business unit, or GBS. GBS will unlock further efficiencies and capabilities of our people and resources. We will do this by developing digital tools for the organization, making data and insights more accessible across the system and growing our future talent pipeline. We'll continue to keep you updated on how our ongoing investment in this area will benefit the enterprise in the years to come. In addition to our accelerating the organization efforts, we're also focused on evolving our approach to capturing incremental customer visits. Central to that is restaurant development, also known as our fourth D. Our strong performance and strength of our brand has earned us the right to begin accelerating the pace of restaurant openings in our major markets over the next several years.While our primary focus is on opening traditional units, we are always testing and learning new ways to meet the needs of our customers. One example is the takeaway-only restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas that opened in 2022. The restaurant site is considerably smaller than a traditional restaurant and as a way customers order and receive their food has changed dramatically over the past few years is geared toward customers based on their need state wherever they are.Another recent example of innovation was -- I was able to see firsthand during my visit to China is the use of food lockers at busy locations with high in-store traffic. Upon arrival, delivery couriers can quickly unlock the designated locker and grab the customer's order without even entering the restaurant, removing friction for both the kitchen and the courier.And our new business ventures team is in the process of developing a new concept we will call [CosMc], which we will test in a small handful of sites in a limited geography beginning early next year. CosMc is a small-format concept with all the DNA of McDonald's but its own unique personality. We look forward to providing you with more information about our development plans and new format innovations at our Investor Day at the end of the year.Finally, before I hand it to Ian, I want to recognize our teams and business partners in France who have handled the unrest in the market with remarkable strength and grace. It has been extremely disruptive to the business on top of an already challenging operating environment. Thanks to everyone connected to McDonald's brands for your dedication and commitment to the business as well as your efforts to keep everyone safe during this volatile time. I'll now turn it over to Ian.Ian Frederick BordenThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, the second quarter was yet another demonstration of consistently strong performance, guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy and fueled by our outstanding execution. We're delivering delicious feel-good moments to our customers in new and exciting ways by doubling down on our creative excellence and highlighting our core menu, all with the value and convenience our customers expect. Our performance speaks for itself and is a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire McDonald's system. With global comparable sales of 11.7% and consistent performance across our segments, it's clear that the McDonald's brand has never been stronger. In fact, the brand was at the center of this quarter as we engage with customers in authentic and culturally relevant ways with campaigns rooted in consumer insights.As Chris touched on a few minutes ago, we took the nostalgic experience of celebrating birthdays at McDonald's and repackaged it for a new generation with none other than Grimace at the center. It quickly became one of our most socially engaging campaigns of all time with millions of reactions on our social media posts, a true demonstration of how the power of our brand emerges in organic and creative ways in our fans. It contributed to the strong double-digit comparable sales growth for the quarter in the U.S. The passion for the brand was also evident in Italy with the launch of a truly unique creative platform, it celebrated the most loved and best-selling beef burger in the market by asking customers, ""What would you do for a Crispy McBacon?"" The answer came in the form of customers getting tattoos of their favorite McDonald's sandwich, driving brand affinity and elevating share gains. I've certainly seen a lot in my 30 years at McDonald's, but this was a new one for me. Truly remarkable.As I mentioned before, our chicken equities remain at the core of our growth strategy. The U.K. celebrated the 40th anniversary of another fan favorite, the Chicken McNuggets by offering limited time sauces to reconnect with the Gen Z consumer. This was coupled with compelling media that showcased the fan truth that sharing your nuggets isn't guaranteed, even if your best friends.China also highlighted the Chicken McNuggets anniversary in a creative way with an integrated marketing campaign. Featuring our 20-piece nuggets, it quickly went viral on social media and generated significant positive buzz among consumers. Spicy McNuggets, one of our most popular line extensions, were offered across various markets this quarter, including Australia and Germany.It is yet another example of how we modernize our core menu, adapt it to meet changing customer taste profiles and scale these new ideas across the globe. Both markets achieved significant lift to the McNuggets line as a result, and Spicy McNuggets sales reached an all-time high in Australia. Our ambition on chicken includes further scaling emerging equities across markets. The McCrispy chicken sandwich, for example, has now scaled to over 10 of our largest markets, including Spain just this past quarter. The sandwich is already resonating with our customers, bringing attention to our chicken portfolio and driving significant chicken share gains.A recent addition to our portfolio of billion-dollar brands, the McCrispy continues to be an important catalyst of chicken growth for many of our markets. The U.K., for example, has achieved market share leadership in chicken, a remarkable growth over the past few years with the launch of both the McCrispy and the McSpicy chicken sandwiches. We look forward to further scaling these new global favorites to customers around the world.A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates and elevated costs, continues to create volatile consumer confidence levels and put pressure on consumer spending. Providing customers with an affordable option has always been core to McDonald's. But in these challenging times, it is even more important for us to remain agile, proactively meeting the needs of our customers. Germany continued the success of its McSmart menu. Initially introduced last quarter to provide entry-level affordable meals, it's contributed to our best sales quarter ever in the market and lifted value perceptions with consumers. The U.K. unveiled a similar offering with its new Saver Meals deals in June, and the early results are encouraging. A permanent addition to the menu, it aims to provide consistent everyday affordability and ensure customers can still enjoy their favorite treats like the Double Cheeseburger despite the rising cost environment.Maintaining our leadership position in value is crucial to future success, and McDonald's holds the #1 position in good value for money and affordability across most of our major markets. This shows that even in the most challenging of environments, our customers know that they can rely on McDonald's to provide an affordable destination for the food that they love. But we know that customers' perceptions on value are made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience that we provide. We've continued to enhance the customer experience, providing the seamless and memorable interactions our customers have come to expect. Last quarter, we introduced an enhanced ordering process through our app in the U.S. with the goal of delivering a faster and more enjoyable experience for the customer. While we're still learning from this deployment, early results have been extremely positive with elevated sales initiated through the app, increased customer satisfaction and improved service times.Canada also introduced new experiences in the app with the launch of the Frequent Fryer Program. Tapping into Canadians passion for travel, the digital campaign celebrated McDonald's fries and the opportunity to taste them in other countries. This creative approach to reengage with our loyalty members resulted in lifts to both digital acquisition and digital customer frequency during the campaign.Now in over 50 markets across the globe, we're continuing to build stronger relationships with our loyalty customers and fueling growth of our digital sales in the process. In our top 6 markets, digital sales represent nearly 40% of system-wide sales, and our loyalty members remain highly engaged with over 52 million 90-day active members across our top 6 markets.As our relationships with these customers continue to grow, we will unlock additional customer needs and explore investments for continued digital innovation at a scale that only McDonald's can achieve. Strong execution across all elements of Accelerating the Arches is creating additional customer demand and share gains across most of our major markets. but we recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment where costs remain elevated, customer discretionary spending is limited and industry traffic is pressured. In line with industry trends and as inflation begins to normalize later in the year, we expect top line growth to moderate.Turning to the P&amp;L. Our strong top line performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of 25% in constant currencies, excluding other charges and gains in both periods as well as a prior year tax settlement. Our company-operated margin performance for the first half of 2023 is in line with our expectations and remains hampered by continued cost pressures. As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect macro headwinds will continue.Total restaurant margin dollars grew by nearly $450 million in constant currencies or nearly 14% for the quarter. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance, provided mainly to our European franchisees where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows. We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 million to $150 million for the year.G&amp;A for the quarter decreased 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by prior year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April and timing of anticipated current year spend. We are pleased with our strong adjusted operating margin of just over 47% for the first half of the year. This was driven by the continued strong top line growth that I mentioned and timing within our G&amp;A spend.For the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 46%, reflecting heavier G&amp;A spend in the back half of the year, along with an expected property gain in other operating income in quarter 4. And our adjusted effective tax rate was just over 18% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.Christopher J. KempczinskiThanks, Ian. As I've said before, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand. Our investments through Accelerating the Arches to create cultural conversations and develop industry-leading innovations have increased the value of our brand and kept us relevant. In June, McDonald's earned an impressive 18 lions across 10 markets at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Additionally, our team in the U.K. and Ireland was awarded the prestigious Marketing Society's Grand Prix, which recognizes the best marketer in the country. The McDonald's brand also rose to the #5 spot in the 2023 Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands report, behind only the leading tech industry brands. As we've upped our marketing game, it's also been interesting to see how our food quality scores with customers have continued to increase. The more customers love our brand, the more they love our food. Beyond the great brand stories created by our marketing teams and agency partners are the thousands of franchisees around the world who create real-life brand stories every day in the restaurants with our customers. Our franchisees and crew bring the McDonald's brand to life with great hospitality, convenience and service. The best brand in the industry, backed by the best franchisees has been our value creation formula for decades.We're always looking ahead to what is next and asking ourselves how do we continue to create the world's greatest franchising opportunity for the world's greatest franchisees for generations to come. This requires making decisions for the long term to earn our success rather than expecting it or assuming it.Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is focused on just that, setting up the company and our franchisees to continue to prosper. Laying the foundation for the future also involved strongly defending the franchise system and independent ownership rights, a position echoed by the National Franchisee Leadership Alliance, the elected representative voice of McDonald's franchise organizations across the U.S.I'm confident that the system is focused on the right priorities and is well positioned to meet the customer needs of tomorrow. Thank you to the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, our thousands of franchisees and our entire network of suppliers around the world who bring the McDonald's experience to life each day. I'll now turn it over to Mike for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Mike CieplakOur first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.Eric Andrew GonzalezMy question is about your expectations for the U.S. consumer. I think last quarter, there was some discussion about your base case that the U.S. would expect a mild recession. And I think you called out that you're starting to see some evidence of trade down in your check management at that time. So I'm wondering, has there been any change in your current thinking and whether those consumer behaviors have intensified or moderated in the last quarter.Christopher J. KempczinskiThanks, Eric, for the question. I'd say, overall, there hasn't been a dramatic change in the U.S. consumer. Sentiment is actually improving a little bit, but we're certainly still far off of where we were back in 2019. As we look at our spend by different sort of economic cohorts, we are gaining share in the -- if you look at incomes under $100,000, we're actually doing quite well there, which suggests that we're getting some benefit from trade down, from things like full-service dining, casual dine, et cetera.And then even if you go to incomes of $45,000 and less, our business is performing well there. What we're seeing with that group is we are seeing a little bit of a decrease in order size. But it's being offset by a very strong or continued strength in traffic.So I think net-net, when you look at all of it, there is certainly concern with the U.S. consumer that shows up in their sentiment. But our business, and particularly I think our value positioning in the market, has put us into a good position to be able to weather that and continue to drive the share gains that you're seeing.Ian Frederick BordenEric, it's Ian. I just might add a little bit to Chris' comments. I think we've talked -- if I just focus on the U.S. over the last couple of quarters about kind of these 2 broad areas of probably consumer adjustment that we've seen. I would say the first one is we are seeing some consumers that are kind of trading down from those more premium or higher-priced items in the menu to more core and value. And then I think as Chris said, we have consumers that continue to visit and -- but probably are just buying a little less.So their basket sizes are a little bit smaller than what they've been previously. I think the context is those 2 factors, though, have been really, while they've been in play for a number of quarters, now have been very consistent. So we're not seeing any further kind of deterioration, I think that which is encouraging.And as Chris touched on, I think, speaks to our leading value for money and affordable positioning in the U.S. business, which we know is industry leading and where we've maintained a really strong gap to the competitive set. I mean, I think it is -- I think the consumer still remains under pressure, obviously, with the macro context, with all of the inflationary impacts that they're seeing on their kind of their basket of goods and obviously with rising interest rates.But we know we had obviously positive traffic growth in the quarter in the U.S. business. We know that on a comp basis, we continue to outperform the broader sector. And I think as Chris touched on in his opening remarks, we're doing -- we continue to focus on the experience, and we know based on the feedback that we're seeing from our customers that we're delivering an improved experience. I think that's a credit to the U.S. business and all of our franchisees and the really strong focus they've got on executing and make sure we deliver for the customer when they do choose us.Mike CieplakOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.David E. TarantinoIan, I wanted to follow up on your comments about sales moderating as the year goes on, which is understandable given the starting point here. But specifically, I was hoping you could perhaps break down the guest count growth versus the check growth in the U.S., and if you have it in IOM as well for the second quarter.And then how do you expect the check growth component to moderate as kind of the inflation environment gets a little bit more moderate? So I guess if you could just frame that up for us, that would be helpful.Ian Frederick BordenThanks, David. Well, look, what I'll do is, I think, kind of give you the broad brush factors that I think we consider when we talk to kind of our expectation of a moderation in our top line as we kind of work through the back half of the year. I think there are 3 things there that I'd call out. The first is just, we certainly believe from a kind of COVID comparability that the substantive kind of tailwinds are fully behind us as we move into the back half of the year. So I think that's the first piece.The second piece is just as we've talked to in our opening remarks, I mean, we certainly are seeing inflation start to gradually come down. I think that's been the case in the U.S. business probably starting the end of last year -- it's obviously still elevated, but I think we are seeing that gradual kind of decline. And I think in the majority of our international markets, we started to see, I think, as we head into the back half of the year, the gradual decline begin there as well. And so I think as inflation begins to come down, I would certainly expect our pricing levels to also start to come down. So that's the second factor. And I think then the third factor would just be, as Chris touched on previously, I mean, I think there are a number of our top markets where we know the macroeconomic conditions are challenging. We know there continues to be a lot of pressure on consumers. We know consumer sentiment continues to be impacted. And so we do expect the broader sector to kind of -- begin to kind of decline in those markets as we go through the back half of the year. And so I think that's kind of the third broad kind of trend that we think about when we talk about moderation.So if I spoke specifically to the U.S., I think -- we're obviously looking at kind of a 1-year comparable, but also kind of comparing back to 2019, I think that moderation is probably more pronounced in the back half of the second half than the front half. But I think if you step back and you think -- you look at the quarter 2 results, we had positive traffic across each of the 3 operating segments.We are laser-focused on what we certainly feel is the most important metric, which is that we are continuing to gain market share in the majority of our top markets. We know we continue to outperform the competitive set, and that's certainly what we're laser-focused on. We feel really confident about how our Accelerating the Arches strategy continues to resonate across all the markets we do business with and the strength of our underlying momentum.Mike CieplakThe next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.Jeffrey Andrew BernsteinJust looking at the guidance that you provided. I think you mentioned that operating margins, you're now expecting at 46% for this full year ex the restructuring charges seemingly raised from the 45% prior. Just wondering if you can maybe offer some color as to what you believe are the primary drivers of that?And just as importantly, how should we think about that operating margin looking out 1, 2, 3 years? Is that reasonable to assume that, that continues to grind higher? Or is there a certain level where you'd expect that would top out whether just naturally or whether based on reinvestment that you might want to make? I'm just wondering how you think about that operating margin, especially in the current environment.Ian Frederick BordenJeff. Well, let me start with that one. Thanks for the question. So let me start, I think, with 2023. And as you touched on, I think we started the year with an op margin guidance of about 45%. We've updated that now to, say, about 46%. We're really pleased with our performance in the first half of the year where we were about 47% from an op margin standpoint. And I think that connects to what we've talked about pretty consistently, which is we do believe that over time, as we continue to drive top line growth, that we can continue to get leverage in our op margin line. I think we saw that in the first half.As we head into the second half, I think there are a couple of things that kind of are specific to the guidance for the full year. Firstly, I think it's the inflationary pressures and margin pressures, we certainly believe will continue. I just talked about kind of the moderation of the top line as we kind of work through the rest of the year. Also expect, as I touched on in my opening remarks, that our G&amp;A spend for the year will be more back half than front half weighted. So that's a factor.And the other call out, and I kind of touched on this again in my opening remarks was we do expect, and this is in the guidance, that we will have a onetime property gain in the fourth quarter. I think as we look forward, again, I would just reiterate that we certainly believe as we're continuing to being able to drive that top line growth, that we can continue to gain leverage in the op margin line. And I think it's something we'll certainly talk about further in the Analyst Day at the end of the year.Mike CieplakOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.David Sterling PalmerI would love to hear more detail about the IOM trends and insights from those countries. You're -- where are you seeing relative strength and weakness? And what do you ascribe those trends to? I mean, I asked partly because we're still dealing with post-COVID dynamics in some of those markets that are perhaps greater than the U.S. with some back to travel, back to work in center cities.But I'd also be interested to hear about macro headwinds you're already seeing in the business. You mentioned the value menu launches in Germany and the U.K. So wondering if you were doing those as proactive launches or perhaps reactionary?Christopher J. KempczinskiDavid, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, as you saw in the results, overall, our IOM business put up very strong performance. So we're very pleased with that, and it's a credit to the team and how they're executing against that. Also, as you probably know, our IOM, particularly our European markets are facing even more significant inflationary pressures, U.K. in particular, than in the U.S. And the teams there have done a really nice job of putting in the pricing that they need to, to ensure that we're protecting margins, franchisee margins, but at the same time, that we are maintaining our affordability and value for money leadership in those markets. And our measures there continue to hold up quite well.I think the other thing that's going well for us is just the execution that we're seeing in our IOM markets. They continue to make progress on service times. Customer satisfaction scores are continuing to increase. So there's been really a strong performance from an operations standpoint over in Europe.Where you do see, and every country has obviously got a little bit of a different nuance. But certainly, the unrest that I mentioned in my opening comments in France has put some challenge from a macro standpoint on that business. We've also had a number of restaurants that have actually been impacted through some of the protests there that we've had to take off-line, and they're going to need to go and get rebuilt.So there is pressure that we've seen from a macro standpoint in France. In the U.K., U.K. is dealing with probably be worse, we're close to the worst consumer sentiment in Europe. And that's putting some pressure on the business. But overall, our U.K. business is performing well. And I think each market has its own approach to value. But we're seeing, I think, that probably being a little bit more of an orientation in those markets just to make sure that as we build our second half plan, that we've got a strong value message as part of that.So overall, very pleased with how our IOM and, in particular, European markets are performing. And I wouldn't say there's anything one in particular that -- the reason for that is it's the whole playbook of value. It's a focus on core menu. They've had great chicken growth. And then, of course, we're seeing all the benefits for digital.And one of the things that is maybe not fully appreciated, but with 52 million people in our top 6 markets now, in our loyalty program, we do typically see about a 15% increase in frequency when we get members into loyalty. And we're still seeing high single-digit growth rates in our loyalty programs in terms of sign-ups. So that continues to be a tailwind for us in the business.Mike CieplakOur next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.John William IvankoeActually, my question is in the context of value. It's a perfect follow-up to that. So you discussed some of the success of the McSmart value menu, the Saver Menu. And obviously, I'm hearing a lot about global solutions. As we kind of think about ways to drive traffic, drive sales, maybe to some extent, at the expense of margins, does it make sense to consider the return of a dollar-style menu in the U.S., Canada, France, Australia, what have you? I mean, does -- is a value menu, at least in some construct, part of what you see the big 6 or big 7 offerings to consumers to be? Is that something that is on the front burner?Christopher J. KempczinskiYes, I'll take that. So I think the starting point is to just emphasize, we're winning on value. So the programs that we have in place are working and delivering for us, And it shows up not just in our overall performance, the fact that we're driving both check and we're driving guest counts, but it shows in our consumer sentiment scores where we are maintaining our leadership and affordability and looking value for money. So there's nothing broken from a value standpoint that from my vantage point, you would need to change. I think we feel really good that the value programs that we have in place are actually driving the success.The probably only thing that teams would be looking at is as they think about marketing communication in the back half of the year, do they maybe emphasize a little bit more of driving awareness of the value programs that already exist in the market. That may be something that some markets consider doing. But we feel great about the value programs that we have in place in each of our markets today, and I wouldn't expect to see any changes from the programs that we have.Ian Frederick BordenMaybe just a little -- a build to Chris. I think just one of the things that we feel really good about in the business is just how our teams are continuing to be proactive and agile in kind of, obviously, a volatile set of external circumstances. And I think that's -- the example in both the U.K. and Germany of what the teams have introduced there is a great example of learning from each other because there's a lot of consistency in those programs, but bringing them to life in ways that are relevant.And doing that, while we're in a position of strength as we are in both markets, Germany, as an example, in the second quarter had an all-time sales record for their business. So I think this is us staying close to our consumers, make sure -- making sure we're leaning into the needs of our consumers as they work through the broader macroeconomic challenges and I think really continuing to make sure that such an important strategic element of our business continues to resonate in consumers in a way that's relevant in the context of each individual market.Mike CieplakOur next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.Brian John BittnerI wanted to ask about store level margins. Clearly, your same-store sales were very impressive in the second quarter, over 10% comps in the United States. But store level margins in the U.S. were still down about 70 bps year-over-year in the quarter. So can you talk more specifically about what is causing the drag on margins despite such strong top line?And as the top line potentially slows moving forward, as you talked about, is there a scenario where store-level margins can start to show improvements? Or is this a situation where you anticipate store-level margins to feel more pressure for longer?Ian Frederick BordenBrian, it's Ian. Thanks for the question. Well, look, I would start with the headline. I mean, our belief is that the best way to drive sustainable margin improvement is for us to focus on driving strong momentum in the business. And I think the U.S. business is the perfect example of that, while certainly as you work through these kind of rapid and accelerated periods of inflation, there's pressure from a percentage basis, and we've clearly seen that in the U.S. business, I mean, I think, that the example would be that the strength of our momentum in the U.S. actually means that our owner-operator cash flow is up year-over-year obviously in a continued challenging environment. And that's what we're focused on, is how do we drive sustainable margin dollar cash flow growth for ourselves and for our franchisees.I think from a percentage basis, you're right. I mean, I think we continue to see pressure, obviously, from food and paper inflation, labor inflation. I think our -- we talked about earlier in the year remains in place. We said this and I think we are consistent with that in the sense that we thought our McOpCo margin in the U.S. business would be kind of roughly in line in terms of '23 with where we were at quarter 4 2022. But we have a lot of confidence that as we continue to drive that strong top line momentum as we go forward, that will continue to be able to drive both margin dollars and over time, margin percentage growth within the business.Christopher J. KempczinskiAnd I would just add, as I mentioned in my opening comments, I've been to a number of markets. I've had a chance to talk to franchisees in a number of markets. And I've been very impressed and pleased with how they're thinking about working through the current scenario right now, which is they're playing the long game. And they recognize the importance of us continuing to make sure we have leadership in value and affordability as they also think about how do they rebuild margins back to kind of where we were during this preinflationary spike.And so in many cases, the conversations we're having with franchisees are about more of exiting the year, and where do we want to see margins when we exit the year but recognize that there may be some short-term impacts on this as we continue to balance our need for margin but also our need to maintain our leadership with customers. So it hats off to the franchisees who I think are taking the exact right perspective on this, and it's what shows up in our performance and the reason why we're taking share in almost all of our major markets.Mike CieplakOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.Dennis GeigerI wanted to just ask a little bit more on how you're thinking about maintaining some of the underlying momentum and the share gains you've seen for quite some time now in the U.S. As you think about some of the key drivers in place across the 3 Ds, the operational execution, newer sort of ready on arrival stuff, et cetera, can you just sort of unpack how you think about the most impactful traffic and sales opportunities in the next year, maybe even over the coming years? .Christopher J. KempczinskiIt all goes back to the strategy of Accelerating the Arches. And when we laid out Accelerating the Arches, we talked about our MCD framework. It's about great marketing. It's about focusing on core menu. It's about 3 Ds, now the 4 Ds. And so 1 of the things that I -- and that underlying all of that is about great execution. And I think one of the things that, for me, gives me confidence about the strength and resiliency of our business, not just in the U.S. but around the world, is that it's broad-based. It's not being driven by one-off promotion. It's not being driven by kind of just silver bullets.You're seeing it because of consistent execution across the entire strategy. So you're seeing evidence of where we continue, I think, to up our game from a marketing standpoint. That's driving strength around our brand scores. Our brand has never been in a better place than it's been. Our focus on core menu and things like best burger, the focus that we have on chicken, we're gaining share in both chicken and beef which -- off of core menu, which has a lot of benefits. And then we continue to do a great job of executing against our 3 Ds and -- well, against our 4 Ds.Digital for us is something that is actually, I think, a virtuous loop, where you're seeing the stronger our digital business becomes, the more that it's driving customer engagement in digital. Our app downloads, when you compare us to anybody else in the industry, it's orders of magnitude difference. And that creates some economies of scale that become self-perpetuating over time.So as I look out for the business -- for us, it's going to be about continuing to do all the things that we're doing on that. And underneath that is the execution that we're seeing in our restaurants. And with the PACE program that we put in place last year, it was in most of our major markets. This year, we added the U.S. But you're seeing service times come down across the board in our major markets. You're seeing CSAT or customer satisfaction scores go up in all of our restaurants. So I wouldn't attribute our success to anything. It's the fact that we're executing across the entire Accelerating the Arches playbook that gives me confidence in those. So this is a momentum business. When you've got momentum, it helps. And it can be self-perpetuating. Now you don't want to get complacent on that. But the fact that we have momentum, I think, is driving inhibition. It continues to drive our operators' willingness to invest because they do see that as we play this out, we've got a long runway. And we certainly believe we have a long runway here at McDonald's.Mike CieplakOur next question is from Chris Carril of RBC.Christopher Emilio CarrilSo Chris, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks and you plan to share more at the Investor Day, but could you maybe expand a bit more on the development outlook as we think about the second half of this year as well as beyond 2023? You've seen strong top line momentum, improving margins, and you've made organizational changes to help support development. So what are the key unlocks here or next steps going forward to accelerate new restaurant openings?Christopher J. KempczinskiSure. Well, we will share much more detail about this at the Analyst Day at the end of the year. So I won't get into the specifics, but I will talk about the activities that we're doing right now, which is one of the starting point is just looking at our opportunity with traditional restaurants. And if you think about -- over the last several years, our focus has been largely globally around reinvestment. In the U.S., we haven't grown units going all the way back to 2014. If you go to a number of our large IOM markets, the growth there from a unit standpoint has been pretty anemic compared to what we think is the opportunity in.So we are doing a very detailed both top-down and bottoms-up look to say what is the development opportunity that exists in each of those markets and how do we go and exploit that, use the U.S. as one example. I think the other thing that we look at is, think about the U.S. restaurant estate today. And the U.S. restaurant estate today reflects probably what the demographic profile or the population profile looked like 20 or 30 years ago. And imagine the amount of shifts that have happened, people moving to the South, Southeast, That isn't reflected in our footprint.Our footprint reflects what the population looks like probably 20 or 30 years ago. So you end up finding there's a number of places around the U.S. where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today. That opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after. The other thing that we're overlaying on top of this is we are, as I mentioned in my opening comments, thinking about small format and how do we bring new concepts that open up real estate opportunities that under a traditional model would not necessarily be available to us.A big reason that, that -- we can now look at those is because of the growth that's happened with the digital and delivery, where you don't necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants. So you're now able to look at real estate sites that previously would have been sort of off-limits to us. Those become opportunities. So we're taking all of those things together and rolling that up to get a perspective of what we think the new unit potential is going to be over the next 4 or 5 years. As you would imagine, it's a longer lead item. So this isn't going to be something that shows up in 2024 and even in 2025. But you can start to focus on it, get some real benefits in '26 and beyond, and that's what we'll hear at Analyst Day.Mike CieplakOur next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.Andrew Michael CharlesI wanted to ask about the reiterated $100 million to $150 million of targeted and temporary rent relief in (inaudible). Recognizing the numerous macro challenges in the market, the other brand is certainly successfully navigating these with impressive top line strength in front half of 2023.So when you combine this with better-than-expected IOM and [Costco] margins just in 2Q, just the cost pressure perhaps may not have been a severe (inaudible) anticipated. What do you need to see to reduce the outlook for relief? And just a quick follow-up to that, can you help level set how much of that $100 million to $150 million has been so far in 2023?Ian Frederick BordenAndrew, thanks for the question. So let me just kind of touch on a few things. Look, I think as we've talked about before, providing support to our franchisees is kind of normal course of business for us. Obviously, the difference this year is just the kind of the pace, the scale and the breadth of the pressures, and as you highlighted, obviously probably most centered in Europe.So I think on the backdrop of all of that, we decided towards the back end of last year to kind of provide some more extensive support. As we talk about always -- it's always targeted and temporary. It's always fact-based support, that support goes to franchisees that need support. And I think as you've heard me talk a little bit on some of the other questions this morning, that inflation is kind of coming to play the way we predicted it. So I don't think there's been a difference versus our expectations, which is why we've reiterated that we continue to expect that we will spend between the $100 million to $150 million for the year this year.I think the other thing I just want to go back to because it's so important, and it's certainly something I strongly believe in. I've given you the example before of as we work through COVID, and we provided support at particular moments as we work through that with our franchisees, I think that was fundamental to the exit velocity and momentum that our business had. I think what you can see now if you look at our IOM segment, and Chris talked about this earlier, is the strength of our underlying momentum, the consistency of our momentum.And I believe that's fundamentally connected to decisions like this because they keep our system fully aligned, they keep our system front-footed and focused on the opportunities that we have to continue to drive growth in our business. I believe that's a significant strategic advantage that we have. And I think it's been a key contributor to why we continue to outperform even in markets that may be more difficult from a macroeconomic context.Christopher J. KempczinskiAnd I would just add, again, back to my market visits that I've done in the last couple of months. In some of those conversations that I've had with franchisees, I typically do dinners every time I visit the market with a group of franchisees. And many of them in our IOM markets specifically, have thanked us for the support that we're giving attributed their willingness and ability to focus on the long term, to not necessarily just be chasing pricing in the short term because they understand we're in this together, we're both making investments to ensure that the success of our business is long-term focused.So I think Ian hit it exactly right. When we make the decisions and do the right things for the long term, the benefits time and again we're proven right on that. And I feel very good about the program that we've got in place. And it is temporary and targeted, as it appropriately should be.Mike CieplakOur next question is from Sara Senatore with BofA.Sara SenatoreI guess a couple of questions around the margins, please. First, on the G&amp;A. Could you just talk a bit about what the back half spending might be on -- you sort of come in pretty decently below the full year guide. So I'm just trying to understand what the step-up might be and how to think about that G&amp;A as a percentage of system sales maybe even going forward.And then could you just give us some color on pricing and commodity basket inflation for the U.S. and the IOM markets. I'm sorry if I missed it. But just what -- how much price is on the menu and what the baskets look like?Ian Frederick BordenGreat. Thanks, Sara. Well, let me start with G&amp;A. I just -- I mean, I think a bit of a headline there. I mean I think our normal, let's call it, cycle of spend in the business is probably always a little bit more back half than front half weighted. I think this year, that's a little bit more pronounced. I think there are kind of a couple of probably more substantive factors for that. I think the first one is around our continued investment in technology and digital. I mean, I think you've heard us talk, and me in particular previously, that we will -- we have the capacity and the capability.And we will continue to invest in areas in the business where we believe there's a significant opportunity to drive growth and generate a return. And I think our digital and technology investments have been a clear strong example and continue to be one of our key growth drivers. And I think as Chris touched on previously, we continue to believe we've got significant opportunity as we go forward to unlock further capabilities around our digital and technology platforms. And so we're continuing to accelerate investment in those areas.I think the second one is back to our global business services organization. As you know, as part of our ATO changes earlier this year, we stood up a global business service organization at an enterprise level because we felt there was a relatively significant opportunity to look at how we can digitize, I'll call it, the operational part of our business and drive sustainable efficiencies as we go forward. .So we're doing a fair bit of work and investing right now and looking at that opportunity to understand how big is it? What's it going to take to get after it? How should we think about sequencing and prioritizing the investments. Obviously, once you go into those sorts of journeys, there are other multiyear journeys and commitments to kind of deliver that sustainable end benefit.But if we think of the kind of the broader environment today, the ability to kind of drive sustainable efficiency, the ability to get data and analytics in a sustainable way, I think, is becoming more important. And we think there's a significant opportunity there that we're looking at.So I think our guidance remains intact as we stated at the beginning of the year, which is we expect our G&amp;A to be in that 2.2% to 2.3% of sales range. I would say I think I certainly expect that we'll be closer to the higher end versus the lower end of that range. But that's a bit of texture on G&amp;A.I think on pricing, I mean, obviously, pricing varies significantly based on the context in the individual markets. So maybe what I can do is just give you a little -- I mean, obviously, pricing remains elevated as inflation more broadly remains elevated in the majority of our markets. Maybe a little texture on the U.S., which is, I think if you look at the second quarter, we were kind of on average at a low double-digit level of pricing in the business. I think as we work through the rest of the year, we'll probably end the year in that kind of low double-digit range.A lot of the pricing in the second quarter is kind of carryover from 2022 in the U.S. business as we work through that kind of peak inflationary period. And obviously, as I talked about earlier, we're kind of getting those 2 offsets to the pricing we're taking, which is kind of the trade down and consumers that are kind of continuing to buying a little bit less. Again, those 2 offsets have been very consistent. And as Chris and I have both talked to, we continue to see traffic growth in our U.S. business, we continue to see market share gains, and we continue to see this kind of strong leading value for money and affordability positioning.So I think what I've talked about before, which I think is really important, is the work we've done on in the couple of years before we've kind of got into this more challenging macroeconomic environment around our capabilities that we've put in place with our third-party advisers that we work with and who make recommendations to our business, including our franchisees, on how we price, obviously, our franchisees make those decisions, I think we've had a significant improvement in our capability.I think as Chris has talked about, we've had pretty good discipline from our system and the pricing that we've taken to really kind of get the balance of working through the short-term challenge with a long-term focus on continuing to make sure we're driving momentum, and we feel pretty good about how we've been able to navigate, obviously, a complex environment.Mike CieplakOkay. We're at the bottom of the hour. That completes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.OperatorThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable industries, you can go directly to 10 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market Cap.The most valuable companies in the world operate within various industries, including technology, energy, healthcare, financial services, and communication services. It is important to note that some of the technology and energy companies are listed as the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Many of these biggest companies have had to deal with a number of hurdles in the past few years, such as recessionary fears, overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, needs and demands of the employees, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine.In one of our previous articles, 25 largest energy companies by market cap, we discussed how the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly, causing oil prices to surge. However, according to an article published by CNBC on March 3, new data shows that the war in Ukraine has actually helped the US oil and gas industry as the US became one of the biggest energy-exporting countries. The US exported an average ten million barrels a day during the four-week period, which ended on February 24.In addition to the energy sector, the information technology industry also ranks among the biggest industries in the world. In fact, some of the most valuable companies in our list, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), all belong to the technology sector. Let's discuss what the future of  the technology industry looks like before we move on to the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.The Information Technology Sector on Track to Hit $12 Trillion By 2027Previously, the information technology industry had been subjected to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis. While the supply chain disruptions are back due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry is expected to continue growing in the long term. The information technology market was valued above $8.85 trillion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2023 through 2027, to reach a value of around $11.99 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe technology industry has become one of the biggest industries in the world and has also perhaps been the most consequential over the last couple of decades. In the modern day, technology has changed the way we live our lives and consumer demand for more technology continues to rise.As an obvious consequence, technology companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap. According to an article posted by Reuters on July 1, the market cap for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above the $3 trillion mark for the first time. This milestone follows the company’s launch of a mixed-reality headset.Moreover, the rising demand for tools powered by artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing services is expected to help boost the profits for technology companies. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appreciates the potential of both AI and cloud services as they offer their products and services, including Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing platform, to some of the biggest enterprises around the world. Here are some comments from the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call:“We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.”On February 8, Reuters had reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be rolling out an AI chatbot to operate alongside Bing's search results, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to challenge Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in search and browser technology.The AI war got ignited when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company we all know from ChatGPT.While Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google was previously at a disadvantage with regards to generative AI, but favorable demand trends for AI tools caused the company to take a big step forward. On May 12, Forbes reported that Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google had announced that their AI chatbot “Bard” is open to all and that the users will soon experience a completely new “search generation experience”.On July 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted market-beating earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.44 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.10. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $74.60 billion, up 7.06% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $1.85 billion.Now that we have discussed what's been happening in one of the most valuable industries in the world, let's take a look at some of the most valuable companies in the world, by market cap.50 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market CapCopyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this article, we will be looking at the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.

I’ll now hand the call over to Dave for opening remarks.Dave Mosley: Thank you, Shanye, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you being here with us on today’s call. Amid a tough business environment, Seagate delivered fourth quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, while holding non-GAAP operating margin at 3.5% to narrow our non-GAAP loss per share to $0.18. These results demonstrate financial leverage and our focus on returning to profitability. Importantly, we continue to generate positive free cash flow, achieving $168 million for the quarter and $626 million for the fiscal year, reinforcing Seagate’s solid operational and financial execution amid the business backdrop we have seen in fiscal 2023. This past fiscal year has been shaped by macro and end market conditions that have tested our resilience in addition to our financial performance.I’m proud of our team’s perseverance and execution. As a result of our proactive actions, we’ve lowered our cost structure by more than $350 million on an annualized basis. We’ve enhanced balance sheet flexibility taking out nearly $800 million of debt funded largely by monetizing non-manufacturing facility assets. We reduced production output by approximately 25% compared with peak volume in order to drive better supply/demand dynamics and enhance profitability as the markets recover. And all of these accomplishments were made while delivering on our 30-plus terabyte HAMR product development and qualification milestones with volume ramp on track to begin in early calendar 2024. Looking ahead, we expect the macro end-to-end market conditions that we have flagged throughout fiscal 2023 to continue weighing on demand through at least December.Consistent with our track record of managing what is within our control, we are taking additional measures to weather the near-term business environment. First, we are adjusting pricing, which we believe will help to ensure a healthy industry supply chain for our customers over the long term. And second, we are carefully managing our manufacturing capacity through a build-to-order approach for certain areas of the business to align our future production output with customer qualification and demand plans. It will take time to bring production capacity and associated support resources back online. Therefore, it is crucial that we balance lead times for mass capacity products with our ability to reramp production. We expect these efforts will enable Seagate to efficiently manage supply for our customers as demand improves.I’ll now share some perspectives on near-term demand factors, in particular in the mass capacity markets, starting with our business in China. As expected, sales in China improved sequentially off of the March quarter lows, driven by increased demand in the VIA markets and certain regional cloud and enterprise OEM customers. While these trends are pointing in the right direction, sales are still well below historical levels. Since the strict COVID protocols were eased last December, the pace of economic recovery in China has been uneven. For now, we are forecasting sales into China to remain relatively stable for the balance of the calendar year. We are encouraged to see Chinese authorities begin to inject more stimulus to reaccelerate economic growth.Based on customer input, economic improvement is expected to catalyze e-commerce, drive cloud-related ad revenue and spur new smart city projects. Seagate’s VIA and nearline products are positioned to benefit from these anticipated improvements in the end market demand. Outside of China, nearline demand from enterprise OEM customers has remained soft. CIOs continue to operate under tighter budgets in response to near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Ongoing efforts to optimize existing workloads, both on-prem and in the cloud, are helping enterprise customers defer mass storage deployments. These trends have slowed the pace of inventory absorption among most of our U.S. cloud customers. We have significantly reduced shipments to several large cloud customers in order to accelerate inventory absorption and protect our financial returns.We project it will take another couple of quarters for inventory levels to normalize. We also believe the timing for demand recovery could be affected by spending priorities focused on accelerating the build-out of compute-intensive AI infrastructure. While AI and ML have been around for quite some time, generative AI has quickly emerged as the next megatrend. This megatrend makes us as excited as ever about the long-term growth drivers for Seagate. In addition to the ongoing migration of workloads to the cloud, which we believe is far from over, gen AI is expected to be a catalyst for data creation, underpinning future demand for mass capacity storage. In today’s earliest stages of gen AI development, you’re seeing the necessary first steps of building and training of AI models.These efforts require significant investment in compute architectures, and we’re seeing that investment ramp today. The next stage of development will yield enterprise-specific use cases that leverage trained AI models to convert data into value-enhancing applications. As this phase plays out, cost-effective mass storage will be critical and we see HDD as a long-term beneficiary. We are already seeing examples of content creators generating high-definition images from text, which is growing in use as evidenced by four of the top services selling 20 million images each day. Development is well underway to create data-intensive videos and animations simply from voice commands. The adoption of AI-generated video bodes well for mass capacity storage.For context, today, nearly four million videos are uploaded daily to YouTube and their file sizes can be thousands of times larger than a single image. Additionally, we believe that predictive AI will lead to advances in many fields, including science and health care. For example, predictive AI can be used to analyze large collection of medical images, many created by Gen AI to provide insight for early detection, prevent disease progressions and develop patient-specific treatments. Mass capacity data storage will remain both an enabler and beneficiary of these trends working in harmony with flash and DRAM memories to bring AI applications to bear. While flash will continue to feed high-performance compute engines, mass capacity HDDs will remain the most cost-efficient storage media to house the enormous volumes of data being generated and used for predictive analytics.16 Most Technologically Advanced Countries in the World in 2017Copyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock PhotoEven in today’s unsustainably low NAND pricing environment, HDDs are still roughly five times more cost-efficient than comparable flash solutions on a per bit basis, and we do not project that gap to close in the next decade. This level of conviction is due in large part to our leading technology road map. Seagate is leveraging magnetic recording technology innovations such as HAMR across our mature 10 disc [ph] HDD platform, positioning us very well to meet increasing demand, including from data-intensive AI applications. Given the current business climate, Seagate is focused on product development and execution and helping our customers qualify next-generation drive capacities. We are executing well on both fronts. We continue to deliver aerial density and TCO advancements through our conventional PMR hard disk drive products.Development efforts on what may be our last PMR product are nearing completion and will extend drive capacities into the mid- to upper 20 terabyte range. As mentioned earlier, our 30-plus terabyte product launch plan is fully intact and initial customer qualifications are progressing well. We are on track to begin volume ramp in early calendar 2024. We are also preparing qualifications with a broader number of customers, including testing for lower capacity drives targeting VIA and enterprise OEM workloads. While there is always work to do, I am pleased with the progress the product development teams have made during fiscal year 2023. Overall, Seagate has consistently demonstrated the ability to quickly adjust and execute at a high level on every factor within our control.We remain diligent in managing through near-term business conditions. At the same time, I am excited by the tremendous long-term opportunities ahead brought about by existing and emerging megatrends underpinned by data. Cost-effective mass capacity storage is a critical enabler and Seagate is poised to deliver with strong technology road maps and improving financial leverage. I’ll stop there and hand it over to Gianluca.Gianluca Romano: Thank you, Dave. Amidst the current industry down cycle, we delivered results that demonstrate our ability to maintain disciplined production output and strong cost control measures. For the June quarter, we reported revenue of $1.6 billion, in line with our recent public commentary and non-GAAP loss of $0.18 per share, slightly better than the midpoint of our guided range. Total hard disk drive revenue declined 14% sequentially to $1.4 billion, with shipment of 91 exabytes. Mass capacity revenue declined 20% sequentially to $1 billion, reflecting softer demand in the cloud nearline market, partially offset by an improvement in the VIA business. Shipment into the mass capacity markets totaled 75 exabytes compared with 104 exabytes in the March quarter.Mass capacity shipments as a percentage of total HDD exabyte was roughly 82% compared to the March quarter 88%. The expected slowdown in our cloud business led to nearline shipments of 55 exabytes, down 37% sequentially. As Dave outlined earlier, we anticipate that it will take a couple more quarters for CSPs to consume inventory and demand to improve. Specific to the VIA market, revenue was up sequentially from what we believe was a demand drop in the March quarter. We expect a relatively stable VIA demand environment in the second half of the calendar year, although still below the run rate before the downturn. Within the legacy market, revenue was $401 million, up 8% sequentially, reflecting higher demand for mission-critical products. The client and consumer markets were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, typical for a June quarter.Finally, revenue for non-HDD business decreased 15% sequentially to $218 million. As anticipated, current IT spending behavior in light of economic uncertainties impacted our enterprise system business. We expect this headwind and the purchase timing for a couple of large customers to result in a meaningful decline in our system revenue in the September quarter. Importantly, we shipped our first HAMR-based CORVAULT system for revenue as planned during the June quarter. We expect broader availability of these CORVAULT systems by the end of calendar 2023. Moving to our operational performance. Non-GAAP gross profit in the June quarter was $313 million, down 10% sequentially, reflecting lower revenue and a less favorable mix partially offset by lower underutilization costs.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 80 basis points sequentially, approaching 20%. Underutilization cost decreased to approximately $40 million in the June quarter as we temporarily increased production to build long lead time components. Based on the current business outlook that Dave outlined, we expect higher underutilization costs in the September quarter. However, we expect gross margin to modestly increase as our cost structure improvements are fully realized and we implement pricing adjustments in certain markets during the second half of calendar 2023. We reduced non-GAAP operating expenses to $258 million, down $91 million year-over-year and $24 million sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects our cost structure improvement actions to-date, lower variable compensation as well as disciplined cost management.We expect non-GAAP OpEx in the September quarter to be similar to the June quarter, reflecting nearly full realization of cost savings from restructuring efforts announced in April, offsetting an increase related to the recent sales and leaseback of three nonmanufacturing sites. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the June quarter with liquidity level of approximately $2.3 billion, including our revolving credit facilities of $1.5 billion, which was lowered by $250 million as previously disclosed in the credit agreement amendment. Inventory was down $60 million quarter-over-quarter at $1.14 billion and we will continue to focus on reducing our own inventory in the coming quarters. Capital expenditure totaled $50 million in the June quarter, down 7% sequentially.Fiscal year 2023 CapEx was $316 million or roughly 4% of revenue. We target lower CapEx in fiscal year 2024 as we maintain our focus on shifting to a build-to-order factory loading, balancing supply to demand and still supporting our innovation-driven product road map. Free cash flow generation was $168 million for the quarter and $626 million for the fiscal year, reflecting solid operational execution and efficiency in working capital management. We expect free cash flow to be lower in the September quarter as we incur a majority of the cash payments associated with the restructuring charges announced in April. We used $145 million for the quarterly dividend and exited the quarter with 207 million shares outstanding. There were no share repurchases during the quarter.Our debt balance exiting the quarter was $5.5 billion down $507 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting the 2023 notes retirement. This debt reduction was mostly funded through the sales and leaseback of the three facilities noted earlier. Additionally, we raised $1 billion in new notes and user proceeds to prepay $450 million of existing term loans and retire the March 2024 notes of $500 million. As a result of these actions, we now have less than 12% of total debt coming due over the next two fiscal years. Interest expense in the June quarter was $84 million and is expected to increase lightly for the September quarter, reflecting a full quarter of the debt restructuring actions that I just described. Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months totaled $974 million resulting in a net debt leverage ratio of 4.8 times well below our amended credit agreement terms.According to our September quarter outlook, for the hard drive business, we expect incremental improvements in mass capacity to offset declines in the legacy markets. For non-HDD revenue for the system business is expected to decrease sequentially during part to demand timing among a couple of our large system customers as noted earlier. With vetted context, we expect September quarter revenue to be in a range of $1.55 billion plus or minus $150 million. As a mid-point of our revenue guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be in the low to mid-single digit range, which includes the proactive measure we discussed today partially offset by higher under-utilization cost in the range of $70 million.

With a market capitalization of $12.7 billion and sales of $8.4 billion, Seagate's stock price stands at $61.36, while its GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $55.79.

A GF Value AnalysisUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It's calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's ideal fair trading value.Seagate Technology Holdings PLC's stock is believed to be fairly valued according to our GF Value Line. This assessment is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment factor, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and likely to yield poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, it may be undervalued and poised for higher future returns.Is Seagate Technology Holdings PLC Stock Fairly Valued? A GF Value AnalysisSince Seagate Technology Holdings PLC is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to align with its business growth rate.Financial StrengthAssessing a company's financial strength is crucial before investing in its stock.

Its overall financial strength is 3 out of 10, indicating a poor financial position.Story continuesIs Seagate Technology Holdings PLC Stock Fairly Valued?

Its profitability score is 8 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Company growth is a crucial factor in valuation.

Its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 12.3%, ranking better than 53.12% of companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the human resources industry, head directly to 5 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past two decades, the staffing industry has seen a rapid change. Gone are the days of aggressively searching newspapers and paper-postings to find employment opportunities. With stratospheric adoption of technology, human resource processes have drastically changed. Given this metamorphosis, businesses now face an unprecedented set of opportunities and challenges. Another major post pandemic change has been the demand for greater work flexibility by employers and employees. Following this, there is a strong expectation for freelance work opportunities to increase. Over the years, freelance platforms have presented a competitive ecosystem where businesses can attract candidates better suited to their needs. Furthermore, as remote work seems to be increasing, experts expect the market for staffing solutions to grow in accordance. With firms looking to outsource more human resource related affairs, competition is only expected to grow in the staffing sector. Don't Miss: 12 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy NowAnother major development has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence in various professions. With companies such as Oracle working on developing AI to enhance innovation in business, McKinsey expects staffing companies to take a similar approach by incorporating AI in their cloud-based human resource platforms. A survey by Gartner reported that while only 17% of total staffing companies used AI in 2019, the percentage was set to increase to over 30% by the end of 2022. Although AI can be incorporated in various staffing procedures, it presents a series of challenges as well. The biggest challenge would be the funding costs for development and integration of AI in processes. Safety, security, and privacy are other concerns that are inherently built into AI exploration. Another technical issue could be integrating new features into currently used systems. Needless to say, there is a room for a lot of innovation in the industry.Story continuesIn 2021, the PGC Group reported that the staffing industry in the United States approximately grew by 28% to generate sales in excess of $186.9 billion. It was also reported that the sector had outgrown market expectations by $6 billion. In terms of market size, the US market dominates the industry. As per IBIS World, the total market for the human resources and staffing industry can potentially exceed $760 billion in 2023.  Investors looking to diversify their holdings and benefit from the growth opportunity in the human resources and staffing market can check out stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). Our Methodology We selected the following human resources stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023.

This includes services around employee benefits, payroll, and risk mitigation services. TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET) also caters to taxation, healthcare, and retirement related services.

(NYSE:TNET) gained 4.12% upon announcement of Q2 results. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 16 hedge funds were bullish on TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET), in contrast to 23 hedge funds from the previous quarter. William Von Mueffling’s Cantillon Capital Management remains the largest shareholder in TriNet Group, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADP), TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET) is one of the best human resources stocks to invest in. 10. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) is a global provider of recruitment and hiring services. Be it Europe, Asia, or the Middle East, the company is engaged with all kinds of businesses to scout the best talent. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) provides services regarding permanent and temporary employment. In addition, ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) also offers employee assessments, reviews and training. On May 5, the company declared an increase in dividend payments by 8.1% to $1.47 per share. ManpowerGroup reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 on July 20, missing Street estimates by $0.03. However, revenue for the period came in at $4.9 billion, beating market consensus by $40 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, a total of 19 hedge funds were bullish on ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN), as opposed to 20 in the last quarter of 2022. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $97.4 million. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Insperity, Inc.

Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Management holds the largest stake in the company, comprising 358,063 shares worth $43.5 million. Lakewood Capital Management had this to say about Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Earlier this year, the fund initiated a position in Insperity, a provider of outsourced human resources for small- and medium-sized businesses. We began purchasing shares in February as the stock declined significantly following disappointing earnings and guidance related to an unusual spike in employee benefit costs. Subsequent share price declines during the March stock market sell-off, primarily due to concerns about the health of the company’s core customer base, allowed us to purchase additional shares in a high-quality, growing and cash generative business at an extremely discounted valuation.Insperity operates what is called a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), whereby it serves as the co-employer for around 240,000 worksite employees (WSEs) across almost 9,000 companies. Insperity provides a wide range of human resources offerings to its clients and uses its position as a large “employer” to negotiate lower benefit pricing (including health insurance and workers’ compensation) than its clients would be able to obtain individually. This model has proven remarkably successful, with Insperity growing WSEs by 9% annually since 1999, while expanding gross profit and EBIT during the same period by 11% and 15% per annum, respectively.

(NYSE:RHI) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is the market leader in professional staffing for small and medium sized businesses. The company has a premier temporary and permanent placement franchise in the field of accounting (Accountemps) and finance, while its Protiviti business has become a strong domestic and international consultancy. RHI’s reinvestment in technology, including its national database, candidate performance scoring, and proprietary AI and matching capabilities are driving share gains versus fragmented competition. The business model is asset-light and generates consistently strong returns-on-capital, industry leading margins, and free cash flow. The less cyclical Protiviti business accounts for 30% of income. Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor. Additionally, there are concerns around AI and the disruption that it could have on accounting. Our view is that the sentiment around the latter appears overdone, as demand for accountants has increased over time despite major advances in productivity tools.”7.

Businesses on the demand side benefit by having extensive access to specialized talent, enabling faster and more cost effective hiring, and by having the strategic optionality inherent in the ability to flex a portion of their workforce based on changing demand requirements.Labor markets have long had unnecessary frictional inefficiencies driven by regional talent imbalances and long-term trends of increased specialization of labor and declining labor mobility.

Building on the solid operational foundation we have already put in place, we are now focused on significantly strengthening the company’s consumer-facing capabilities while prioritizing the top 10 countries and top 25 brands, which represent about 90% of sales. Consistent with the new strategy, we are investing in consumer and customer understanding, brand building, brand communication, innovation and retail execution as part of our One Newell approach to unlock the full power of our leading consumer brands, create and leverage scale and drive operational excellence. While we have lots of work to do, we are off to a great start, which is why I remain confident in our ability to accelerate the company's financial performance over the long term, while we continue to navigate through a challenging macro-economic backdrop in the near term.""Mark Erceg, Newell Brands Chief Financial Officer, said, ""Restoring strong operating cash flow and improving the underlying structural economics of our business remains our primary financial focus this year. Against those two measures, we were very pleased with our second quarter results, with operating cash flow up over $500 million dollars versus last year and normalized operating margin ahead of expectations. As we look toward the balance of the year, we expect top and bottom-line pressure to persist as consumers continue to wrestle with elevated levels of core inflation and the resumption of student loan repayments. Despite these pressures, and because of the conviction we have behind our new strategy, we have chosen to invest more behind capability building and brand support during the second half of the year. While some of these investments will lower near term earnings, we remain confident in our operating cash flow guidance for the full year and, just as importantly, because of the meaningful interventions we are making across all facets of the business, we expect second half normalized operating margin to be up significantly versus both the first half of this year and the second half of last year.""Story continuesSecond Quarter 2023 Executive SummaryNet sales were $2.2 billion, a decline of 13.0 percent compared with the prior year period.Core sales declined 11.9 percent compared with the prior year period.Reported operating margin was 5.4 percent compared with 12.9 percent in the prior year period.Normalized operating margin was 9.1 percent compared with 14.0 percent in the prior year period.Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.04 compared with $0.48 in the prior year period.Normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.24 compared with $0.56 per share in the prior year period.Year-to-date operating cash flow was $277 million compared with outflow of $450 million in the prior year period.In May 2023, the company updated its capital allocation framework and dividend policy, aligning them with the new corporate strategy, which was rolled out in June 2023.In May 2023, the company announced the Network Optimization Project, which aims to simplify and streamline its North American distribution network.The company updated its full year 2023 outlook for net sales and normalized earnings per share to $8.2 billion to $8.34 billion and $0.80 to $0.90, respectively. The company's outlook for operating cash flow remains unchanged.Second Quarter 2023 Operating ResultsNet sales were $2.2 billion, a 13.0 percent decline compared to the prior year period, largely reflecting a core sales decrease of 11.9 percent and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange.Reported gross margin was 28.5 percent compared with 33.0 percent in the prior year period, as the impact of fixed cost deleveraging, inflation and higher restructuring-related charges more than offset the benefits from pricing and FUEL productivity savings. Normalized gross margin was 29.9 percent compared with 33.1 percent in the prior year period.Reported operating income was $120 million compared with $328 million in the prior year period. Reported operating margin was 5.4 percent compared with 12.9 percent in the prior year period, as the impact of lower net sales, lower gross margin, non-cash impairment charges and an increase in restructuring and related costs more than offset benefits from pricing, FUEL productivity savings and Project Phoenix savings. Normalized operating income was $201 million, or 9.1 percent of sales, compared with $355 million, or 14.0 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Net interest expense was $76 million compared with $55 million in the prior year period.Reported tax provision was $17 million compared with $53 million in the prior year period. The normalized tax provision was $16 million compared with $44 million in the prior year period.The company reported net income of $18 million, or $0.04 diluted earnings per share, compared with $199 million, or $0.48 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.Normalized net income was $101 million, or $0.24 normalized diluted earnings per share, compared with $232 million, or $0.56 normalized diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period.An explanation of non-GAAP measures disclosed in this release and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures, if available, are included in the tables attached to this release.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowYear-to-date operating cash flow was $277 million compared with outflow of $450 million in the prior year period, with the improvement primarily driven by working capital and a reduction in incentive compensation payments, which more than offset a decline in operating income and higher restructuring and related payments. Inventories declined nearly $700 million versus the prior year period and nearly $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023, as the company continued to make progress on inventory reduction.At the end of the second quarter, Newell Brands had cash and cash equivalents of $317 million and net debt outstanding of $5.0 billion.In May 2023, the company updated its capital allocation framework and dividend policy, aligning them with the new corporate strategy, which was rolled out in June 2023.Second Quarter 2023 Operating Segment ResultsThe Home &amp; Commercial Solutions segment generated net sales of $1.1 billion compared with $1.2 billion in the prior year period, reflecting a core sales decline of 13.1 percent, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, as well as certain category exits. Core sales declined in all three businesses: Kitchen, Home Fragrance and Commercial. Reported operating loss was $21 million, or negative 2.0 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $74 million, or 6.0 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $23 million, or 2.2 percent of sales, versus $87 million, or 7.0 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Learning &amp; Development segment generated net sales of $813 million compared with $865 million in the prior year period, reflecting a core sales decline of 5.7 percent and the impact of modestly unfavorable foreign exchange. Core sales growth in the Writing business was more than offset by a decline in the Baby business. Reported operating income was $188 million, or 23.1 percent of sales, compared with $245 million, or 28.3 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $199 million, or 24.5 percent of sales, compared with $248 million, or 28.7 percent of sales, in the prior year period.The Outdoor &amp; Recreation segment generated net sales of $333 million compared with $427 million in the prior year period, reflecting a core sales decline of 20.9 percent, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Reported operating income was $5 million, or 1.5 percent of sales, compared with $48 million, or 11.2 percent of sales, in the prior year period. Normalized operating income was $14 million, or 4.2 percent of sales, compared with $54 million, or 12.6 percent of sales, in the prior year period.Restructuring and Savings InitiativesIn January 2023, the company announced a restructuring and savings initiative, Project Phoenix, that aims to strengthen the company by leveraging its scale to further reduce complexity, streamlining its operating model and driving operational efficiencies.Project Phoenix is expected to be substantially implemented by the end of 2023. It incorporates a variety of initiatives designed to simplify the organizational structure, streamline the company’s real estate, centralize its supply chain functions, which include manufacturing, distribution, transportation and customer service, transition to a unified One Newell go-to-market model in key international geographies, and otherwise reduce overhead costs. The company implemented the new operating model in the first quarter, consolidating its prior five operating segments into three operating segments: Home &amp; Commercial Solutions, Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation.The company's expectations for savings and charges in connection with Project Phoenix remain unchanged. The company expects to realize annualized pre-tax savings in the range of $220 million to $250 million when fully implemented, with $140 million to $160 million expected to be realized in 2023. Restructuring and related charges associated with these actions are estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million and are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of 2023. Year-to-date through the second quarter 2023, the company incurred restructuring and related charges of $63 million and realized savings of $52 million related to Project Phoenix. The restructuring plan is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 13 percent of office positions. The company began reducing headcount in the first quarter 2023, with most of these actions still expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to local law and consultation requirements.Following the successful completion of the first phase of Project Ovid, the multi-year initiative to transform the company's go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., in May 2023, the company announced the Network Optimization Project, which aims to simplify and streamline its North American distribution network. The Network Optimization Project incorporates a variety of initiatives, including a reduction in the overall number of distribution centers, an optimization of distribution by location, and completion of select automation investments intended to further streamline the company’s cost structure and to maximize operating performance. The company commenced this initiative during the second quarter 2023 and expects it to be substantially implemented by the end of 2024. The company expects to realize annual pre-tax savings of $25 million to $35 million when fully implemented. Restructuring and related charges associated with the Network Optimization Project are estimated to be in the range of approximately $37 million to $49 million and are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of 2024. The Company also expects to incur $30 million to $40 million in capital expenditures in connection with this project. During the second quarter 2023, the company incurred restructuring and related charges of $9 million related to the Network Optimization Project.Outlook for Third Quarter and Full Year 2023The company initiated its outlook for third quarter 2023 and updated its full year 2023 outlook.Q3 2023 OutlookUpdated Full Year 2023 OutlookNet Sales$2.11 to $2.16 billion$8.2 to $8.34 billionCore Sales7% to 5% decline12% to 10% declineNormalized Operating Margin8.5% to 9.4%7.8% to 8.2%Normalized EPS$0.20 to $0.24$0.80 to $0.90For full year 2023, the company continues to expect to deliver operating cash flow in the range of $700 million to $900 million, including approximately $95 million to $120 million in cash payments associated with Project Phoenix.The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding core sales, normalized operating margin and normalized earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgement and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period in reliance on the exception provided by item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin or normalized earnings per share to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's future financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company's actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.Conference CallNewell Brands’ second quarter 2023 earnings conference call will be held today, July 28, at 11:00 a.m. ET. A link to the webcast is provided under Events &amp; Presentations in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.newellbrands.com. A webcast replay will be made available in the Quarterly Earnings section of the company’s website.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis release and the accompanying remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and category exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the current year reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that ""normalized"" gross margin, ""normalized"" operating income, ""normalized"" operating margin, ""normalized EBITDA"", ""normalized"" net income, ""normalized"" diluted earnings per share, ""normalized"" interest and ""normalized"" income tax benefit or expense, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inflationary adjustments, fire related loss, net of insurance recoveries and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. ""Normalized EBITDA"" is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense.The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a ""with"" and ""without"" approach to determine normalized income tax benefit or expense.The company defines ""net debt"" as short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. ""Free cash flow"" is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. ""Free cash flow productivity"" is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to normalized net income. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking free cash flow productivity to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measure without unreasonable effort or expense.While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.About Newell BrandsNewell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, Sharpie, Graco, Coleman, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate, FoodSaver, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Oster, NUK, Spontex and Campingaz.

These statements generally can be identified by the use of words or phrases, including, but not limited to, ""guidance,"" ""outlook,"" ""intend,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""target,"" ""plan,"" ""expect,"" ""setting up,"" ""beginning to,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""could,"" ""resume,"" ""remain confident,"" ""remain optimistic,"" ""seek to,"" or similar statements. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including impairment charges and accounting for income taxes. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:our ability to optimize costs and cash flow and mitigate the impact of retailer inventory rebalancing through discretionary and overhead spend management, advertising and promotion expense optimization, demand forecast and supply plan adjustments and actions to improve working capital;our dependence on the strength of retail and consumer demand and commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in various countries around the world;our ability to improve productivity, reduce complexity and streamline operations;our ability to manage any actual or perceived ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any additional variants of the virus or the efficacy and distribution of vaccines;competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products;major retailers’ strong bargaining power and consolidation of our customers;supply chain and operational disruptions in the markets in which we operate, whether as a result of the actual or perceived effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or broader geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;changes in the prices and availability of labor, transportation, raw materials and sourced products, including significant inflation, and our ability to offset cost increases through pricing and productivity in a timely manner;the cost and outcomes of governmental investigations, inspections, lawsuits, legislative requests or other actions by third parties, the potential outcomes of which could exceed policy limits, to the extent insured;our ability to effectively execute our turnaround plan, including Project Ovid, Project Phoenix and the Network Optimization Project;our ability to develop innovative new products, to develop, maintain and strengthen end-user brands and to realize the benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend;our ability to consistently maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;the risks inherent to our foreign operations, including currency fluctuations, exchange controls and pricing restrictions;future events that could adversely affect the value of our assets and/or stock price and require additional impairment charges;unexpected costs or expenses associated with dispositions;risks related to our substantial indebtedness, potential increases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings;a failure or breach of one of our key information technology systems, networks, processes or related controls or those of our service providers;the impact of U.S. and foreign regulations on our operations, including the impact of tariffs, product regulation and legislation and environmental remediation costs and legislation and regulatory actions related to data privacy and climate change;the potential inability to attract, retain and motivate key employees;changes in tax laws and the resolution of tax contingencies resulting in additional tax liabilities;product liability, product recalls or related regulatory actions;our ability to protect intellectual property rights;significant increases in the funding obligations related to our pension plans; andother factors listed from time to time in our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other SEC filings.The consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP""). Management’s application of U.S. GAAP requires the pervasive use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.

The headline GRI, which often doesn’t reflect what shippers actually pay, will likely be in the high single digits, which would be a second consecutive record. It should be announced by Thanksgiving.Last year’s record UPS GRI of 6.9% (NYSE: UPS) turned into an actual GRI of close to 9% after all factors were incorporated into the calculations. Nightingale, whose company keeps close tabs on this data, said his customers were “gobsmacked” when they were told late last year what they would actually be paying in 2023. FedEx Corp., (NYSE: FDX) UPS’ chief rival, had already hit the market with the same record increase.The GRIs, though technically increases on tariff rates, often dictate what shippers will pay in their contracts unless they can negotiate them down.Even a company of UPS’ vaunted efficiency will be unable to offset the higher labor cost burdens without passing on a hefty bill to shippers and consumers, Nightingale said.Compensation and benefits — a large chunk of that paid to 340,000 Teamsters — equal 47% of UPS’ $100 billion or so in annual revenue, according to Nightingale. That proportion is way too elevated for UPS to fully neutralize it with efficiency actions, Nightingale said. UPS already operates at near-peak efficiency given the cost burden its high labor tab has always placed on operations, he added.Story continuesThe question will be whether FedEx and the cluster of regional carriers will look to cherry-pick existing accounts or feel confident in the stickiness of the increase to follow UPS’ lead in their own right, Nightingale said. FedEx, for its part, has its own significant costs to incur as it revamps its operations by integrating its FedEx Express air and FedEx Ground networks.On Tuesday, UPS and the Teamsters agreed to a tentative five-year contract that the union boasted was the best UPS contract ever negotiated. Existing full- and part-time workers will get $2.75 more per hour in 2023 and $7.50 per more hour over the length of the contract, according to the union. Existing part-timers’ pay will be raised to $21 per hour immediately. New part-timers would start at $21 per hour and advance to $23 per hour. The starting wage for many part-timers has been as low as $16 an hour.Based on analysts’ estimates, the full-time and part-time wage increases in the contract’s first year will come in at about 9%, with 4% to 5% per year through years two through five. Historically, increases in the parcel industry come in at 3% per year maximum, Nightingale said, adding that a 3x increase in the first year is a startling jump.The tentative contract will be sent out Aug. 3 to the rank and file to vote on ratification. The deadline for voting is Aug. 22.The post UPS shippers may face double-digit rate increases in wake of contract appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the 52,000 Tractor Supply members for their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here. Team is executing at a high level and did a nice job nimbly adjusting in the second quarter. We're operating in a tougher environment than we expected at the beginning of the quarter and certainly tougher than what we forecasted as we entered the year. Consumer spending continues to shift in favor of services. Shoppers that are tired of inflation are being judicious on their baskets. Consumers continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. And additionally, our business was further impacted by the abnormal seasonal trends, particularly in the month of June. Despite this environment, we still expect 2023 to be a pretty solid year. Our customer is healthy, and we're gaining share, outgrowing our market by 2x and we are significantly outpacing total U.S. retail sales growth. We anticipate that we will have positive sales comps and positive comp transactions for the year, albeit in the low single digits range. And importantly, net sales and earnings will grow strong mid-single digits on top of the 53rd week last year. We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our underperformance to these expectations as specific to the current environment. The team has dialed in and understands the challenges. For the remainder of the call today, I'll speak to a few highlights of the second quarter and then share an update on our Life Out Here strategy. John Ordus will then provide greater insights on our real estate strategy and our plans to accelerate our store growth. And then Kurt will follow John and share further details on the second quarter and our full year outlook. So let's dig in. All right. Turning to the second quarter. We grew net sales by 7.2% with comparable store sales up 2.5% and diluted EPS $3.83, an increase of nearly 9%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.8% and ticket growth of 0.6%. We expected and were pleased to see comp transactions turn back positive and this trend has continued into Q3. We began the quarter with mid-single-digit comp sales growth in both April and May. As we moved through the month of June, we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our seasonal categories with the period coming in modestly positive. In my 25 years in retail, June was one of the most topsyturvy months that I have seen, smoke, drought, heat, hit had a little bit of it all. As mentioned, our customer base is healthy. Our active customer counts are stable and growing. Importantly, our new customer trends have leveled out after a period of lapping tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to break records and improved year-over-year. And customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic. Our Neighbor's Club reached a record 31 million members in the quarter, an increase of 5 million members in the last year. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates remain at all-time high. Neighbors Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall performance and our high-value members reached a record count in the quarter. A few key trend that we're seeing our customers as follows: one, customers are increasing in their usage of credit. Two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in our lower-income customers. And three, customers are buying a little more often but a little less per trip. Now shifting from our customer to our categories. Our year-round categories were up mid-single digits, indicative of our ongoing market share gains and our demand-driven need-based business model. Our consumable, usable and edible categories continue to deliver strong stable performance and drive trips to Tractor Supply. In this quarter, CUE categories had growth in the low double digits. In companion animal, we are gaining substantial share throughout the category. Again, this quarter, we had sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week. In livestock, our spring Chick Days event was one of the largest ever for us with the poultry category up strong double digits. We believe we're on track to exceed last year's record of 11 million birds sold, not only regain growth from existing customers, we are also experiencing robust growth in new customers to the category, and this is driving both trips and ticket. Our seasonal categories were flat and below expectations. The miss was primarily in June when, as mentioned previously, there were a number of choppy environmental conditions across our markets that resulted in the consumer not being as engaged in the categories we expected. This softer seasonal performance in June had a material impact on our second quarter performance and was the main driver of our miss versus our expectations. Our big ticket sales were down in that high single digits and in line with our expectations. And in fact, our performance in the quarter was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The most significant pressure in the quarter was in zero- turns, generators and recreational vehicles. On the real estate front, we opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 3 petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the cadence of our new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. Our petsense Tractor Supply business is performing well and comps in the quarter were greater than over tractor supply. And the integration of Orscheln is right on track. Today, we fully transitioned and rebrand opened 15 locations. We remain very pleased with the customers' response as we convert to the Tractor Supply brand. Although the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we entered the year, I'm incredibly proud of how the team has come together to navigate the various circumstances and control what we can control. Now transitioning to an update on our Life Out Here strategy. We remain very confident in our long-term growth outlook. We participate in a large fragmented and attractive market. We continue to benefit from numerous structural tailwinds, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. We have numerous substantive competitive advantages and are investing to expand them through our Life Out Here strategy. Since we first embarked on our strategy in the fall of 2020, the team has made remarkable progress on the transformation of Tractor Supply. As a reminder, the 5 pillars of our strategy include: deliver legendary customer experiences, advance our ONETractor capabilities, operate the Tractor Way, go the country mile for our team and generate healthy shareholder returns. And the key initiatives that support this strategy include our Project Fusion store remodels, our Garden Center transformation, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program and the expansion of our omnichannel capabilities. Our Project Fusion store layout is now in over 700 stores, representing greater than 30% of our store base. This program is enhancing our space productivity with improved layout, signage, SKU expansions and improved adjacencies. And for remodels, it also offers an improved customer shopping experience that is much more contemporary. Complementing Project Fusion is the sideline transformation, which is leveraging and expanding our existing outdoor side lot retail to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a Garden Center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omnichannel technology investments. With more than 400 Garden Centers today, we've significantly expanded our assortment of lawn and garden products that are relevant to our customers' lifestyle. Importantly, these 2 projects are delivering on our return expectations. They're providing material sales lift. We're seeing improvement in customer satisfaction and we're seeing higher levels of new customer acquisition in these remodeled stores. Also, our execution on the remodels continues to improve as we're in year 3 now of the effort, and we're reducing project costs and also continuing to shorten construction times. We relaunched our Neighbor's Club program to a points-based structure in April of 2021 and the timing was very fortuitous as it allowed us to lock in the millions of new customers that found us through the pandemic. In total, since the relaunch, our membership has increased by 12 million members, a 60% increase. Additionally, the design of the program has facilitated upward spend migration and driven strong retention rates. Lastly, the program provides invaluable insight into our customer behavior and allowed to personalize our offering tailored to their needs. Look for us to evolve the structure again sometime in the next 12 to 18 months to further enhance value for our members. Underpinning our strategy are substantial investments in our distribution network to support the significant sales increase and store growth. Today, our network is achieving record service levels and the strongest productivity we've experienced in the last 5 years. Our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, and our increased count of mixing centers now up to 15 and the implementation of engineered labor standards, are all contributing to this performance. Today, I'm excited to share with you a new strategic focus area that we've been working on for a little over a year, the transformation of our real estate model, enabled by a number of new capabilities that is designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin rate and reinforce our long-term guidance. First, we're raising our new store growth target. We now believe there is a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion of robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores. And we believe we continue to have significant run rate for growth with high return new stores. Second, we're implementing new capabilities to enable owned and development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allowing for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Third, we're also announcing plans to periodically execute sale-leaseback transactions of our existing ownership of 117 stores. And we're going to have a step-up in our ongoing build of stores back to 90 stores per year starting in 2025. Today's real estate announcement extends our runway for growth and reinforces our long-term financial model. It's a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John, who can share some more color on our real estate strategy.John P. OrdusThank you, Hal. It's an exciting time for the store operations in real estate team as we embark on new ways to capture growth and market share while also driving efficiencies in our real estate process. Over the last year, we've installed new leadership talent in our real estate team. This has allowed us to reevaluate where we are in the natural progression of our store growth plans and our ability to leverage our real estate capital structure. This new approach will allow us to realize cost savings and be more nimble with our store portfolio. Our strong outlook for new store growth is a direct correlation of the millions of new customers we have acquired and our overall sales performance over the last several years. This provides us with nearly a decade of new store growth in the United States. We believe these are low risk, high return, organic growth opportunities. We anticipate accelerating our new store growth from approximately 70 stores this year to 80 in 2024 and 90 new stores in 2025 and beyond. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continued strong new store productivity metrics with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis and our stores are profitable in year 1. As part of our growth plan, let's start with new stores. We have developed a new sales forecasting model to determine new stores mature sales and pro forma results to develop our total market store growth opportunity of 3,000 stores. This was the first update to our modeling process in 4 years. We have infused the process with a machine learning model and insights from our 31 million Neighbor's Club members. This gives us tremendous confidence to raise our outlook by 200 stores for a total of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S.. To capture this growth, the real estate team is ramping up our pipeline to allow us to accelerate our store openings to 90 new stores by 2025. We are on track to open approximately 70 new stores this year with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024. We have a robust pipeline of new stores in our sites over the next 24 months. In fact, our pipeline is at the best level of development since prior to the pandemic. The team is also building new capabilities to optimize our real estate portfolio. For instance, we will start on development of stores this year through a fixed fee developer model and over time, anticipate self-development in new stores. This year, we anticipate 20 to 30 of our new stores will be in our own development pipeline, 2024 new store openings, many of which will begin development in this year. A benefit of these new programs is our ability to have more control and visibility in this development process. The great news is that we estimate these capabilities will result in a 10% to 20% estimated rent reduction as compared to a developer model build. This rent reduction helps us continue to improve our new store returns. Part of the investment and creation of this development model requires more upfront cash. It is exciting that we are able to fund the sale leaseback of 10 to 15 stores this year out of the 117 stores that we own. Going forward, we plan to use the sale-leaseback program on both existing owned stores as well as new store openings. This program will help fund our planned on store development. It will also capture value in currently owned stores. With nearly 2,200 stores, we are also strategically investing in and optimizing our existing store portfolio as part of the lease renewal cycle. All stores will go through an in-depth review to ensure we have the right real estate strategy in place. We will then take action to ensure that all stores have the right location, size, facility, rent structure and format. These factors are critical to the success of our team and stores to deliver legendary customer service. With that, let me now pass it over to Kurt for our financial review.Kurt D. BartonThanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. Turning to our second quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, I commended team on how they have remained nimble and steadfast in our commitment to be the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. In many ways, our second quarter top line results were very consistent with our results in the first quarter with strong CUE growth, flattish seasonal performance and a decline in big ticket sales. .Our comparable store sales growth was the strongest in the Far West, South Atlantic and Texas, Oklahoma. The strength of these regions was offset by pressure in the Northeast and Midwest regions where seasonal trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand. Comp sales in the quarter benefited by about 5 percentage points from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price increases that put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet. Much like the first quarter, the benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by the impact of 3 factors: First, the average ticket was impacted by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Second, we also experienced softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items. Third, on a positive note, we also saw our customers shopping us more frequently, with a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Overall, our customers are buying more units or pounds from us in total. Moving down to income statement. Our gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion. Gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year's second quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs, driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies of our new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate. As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 77 basis points to 22.8%. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&amp;A. The growth in medical claims is due to new benefit offerings that had stronger engagement rates than we anticipated as well as higher program costs overall. We have made some adjustments to the program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024. Approximately 80% of our SG&amp;A growth year-over-year represents investments for growth, such as new stores, the impact of Orscheln Farm and Home, the new DC and the depreciation from our capital investments for items such as Project Fusion remodels and Garden Center transformations. The core SG&amp;A costs leveraged well even in a low comp sales environment. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our cost to our sales performance. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.4%, an 8 basis points decline from the prior year. Consistent with our guidance from the year, Orscheln stores had a modest drag on operating income, principally due to factors unique to the transition. In Q2, we attribute approximately 10 basis points of operating margin decline to activities relating to Orscheln. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $27 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a decrease of 1.7% in average inventory per store. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory we enter the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we strategically issued $750 million in long-term debt, which brings our weighted average fixed rate to 3.4%. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to building on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our real estate portfolio management is another way that we can continue to facilitate strong returns. Let me shift now to share a few financial highlights as a result of the evolution of our real estate strategy. The sale leaseback of 10 to 15 owned stores is anticipated to close during the second half of the year, resulting in a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share. We are under contract on 10 stores and expect to close on those stores in the third quarter. The expected net gain reflects a selective reinvestment of a small portion of the benefit from the sale back into our store infrastructure this year. For modeling purposes, the net gains will be recorded in operating income as an offset to SG&amp;A. Given the migration to our new real estate development strategy, we anticipate that we have about a decade of runway from the sale of existing company-owned stores ahead of us. This increases cash flow over the coming years and is a great way for us to lever the strength of our balance sheet. The more efficient owned development program is expected to drive lower new store rent. As the program ramps, these savings are anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale leaseback of existing stores. In 2025 and beyond, the acceleration of our new store growth to about 90 stores annually should help us capture market share and bolster the high end of our long-term guidance ranges. We continue to have very robust new store economics providing us the confidence to make this shift. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. At the halfway point of the year, we are now forecasting low single-digit comp sales and mid- to high single-digit earnings growth. We continue to believe this will be a year of solid performance for us as we continue to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives. We are carefully watching many leading macroeconomic indicators, consumer behavior and retail trends as well as our own insights to assess the health of the consumer. While our customers remain healthy, we are more cautious about their discretionary spending in the second half of the year. At the same time, we are moderating our expectations for the performance of our seasonal categories based on our trends in the first half of the year, that have been choppy lower expectations. We believe it is prudent to recalibrate our expectations for both the discretionary and seasonal categories based on our year-to-date trends. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, comp store sales growth of 1.3% to 2.5% growth. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.3% with net income of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10.20 to $10.40. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share for the sale-leaseback. We anticipate about $0.15 will be recognized in Q3 and $0.05 in Q4. In the light of the updates to our real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million compared to our prior range of $700 million to $775 million. This increase reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It is important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarters, we continue to believe that comp sales will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Both quarters are modeled to achieve comp sales growth. Please keep in mind that we are lapping a monumental winter storm in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we estimate contributed 200 basis points to comp sales in the quarter. As for retail price increases, our plans continue to reflect a moderation from the impact of inflation. At the same time, we would anticipate a pickup in our comp transaction growth as we experienced this quarter. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, we anticipate continued benefit from transportation and the new distribution center along some pressure from unfavorable product mix. For the third quarter, our SG&amp;A performance exclusive of the sale leaseback is anticipated to be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a modest deleverage given the compare in the prior year. For modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point-of-sale system. We will share more details when we provide our 2024 outlook. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our growth strategy. For Tractor Supply, we expect to end the year in a strong position for the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap this up.Harry A. LawtonThanks, Kurt. Stepping back, Tractor Supply has achieved remarkable growth over the past few years, and the team has done an excellent job scaling our processes, capabilities and organization to manage this growth. .Key operational areas like inventory and payroll grew materially but at a lesser rate than sales and we're always in control. Key philosophies like ELP were reembraced and our marketing media mix shifted fully away from print to digital. And the combination of these 2 enabled our promotional activity to achieve all-time lows, and we remain there. In addition to these efforts, we launched our Life Out Here strategy to continue the ongoing information of our business. This strategy helped lock in new customers, substantiate our market share gains and is a platform for our future growth. The timing could not have been better. At the halfway mark of 2023, it is shaping up to be a solid year for Tractor Supply on top of 3 extraordinary years. Our market is stable and our customers remain healthy. The team is effectively controlling what we control. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary, Tractor Supply remains a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through various economic conditions. As a company, we have a proven ability to manage through dynamic environments, whether that is a macroeconomic or seasonal weather trends. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it. Our customers over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages that are getting stronger every day. Additionally, investment in our Life Out Here strategy has critical mass. The natural evolution of our real estate strategy is furthering our competitive advantages. We see meaningful growth potential in our markets. I remain extremely confident that we have a tremendous runway of growth ahead of us and with the right team and the right strategy, we're continuing to build a strong foundation for the future. With that, let's open up the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse.Karen Fiona ShortWe're going to just kind of roll 2 into one, if that's okay. So the first question and tied into the second was that I think you always had the assumption that your kind of comp would be 1% to 2% above GDP. And that relationship doesn't seem to be holding right now. So I just want to talk about that. And then excluding the benefit of the sale leaseback, you had also kind of indicated '23 would be the peak investment period for you. And then we should start to see operating margin expansion in 2024. Is this still your thinking? And I guess, again, excluding the sale-leaseback development and the benefit.Harry A. LawtonKaren, thanks for joining the call. On your first part of the question, comments earlier. We see this period of time is a bit of an aberration versus our kind of ongoing growth algorithm as you see in GDP and you see where PCE is going and then you see the shift from goods to service right now. Service has historically been 68%, 69% of spend, goods kind of 31%, 32%. As you know, goods kind of shifted up to, say, 35%, 36% during the pandemic, we're kind of halfway back on that march back to 31%. So that, as we said in our prepared remarks, is a bit of a headwind in our business, but certainly expect that we've got maybe halfway to go on that and the level back out in its normal equilibrium and would expect that our growth algorithm would return to that 1% or 2% above GDP growth and the guidance we've given historically. Again, we just view this period of time is a bit of an aberration from that long-term algorithm just given the macro dynamics. And then the second thing is no change to the guidance, so to speak, that we've given on the Out Here. Certainly expect 2023 to still be our peak investment year. As you mentioned, the sale leaseback is really just a $0.20 plus or minus, it will be in every single one of our years going forward as an adder to our EPS, but expect that we'll be at our peak investment period this year, and that will start to moderate down next year with an opportunity for margin expansion accordingly.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.Scot CiccarelliScot Ciccarelli. So I have a question on the real estate changes as well. I mean it makes sense that you guys can improve your cost structure as you take ownership of the build. But if you would expect your stores to remain productive over a long stretch of time. Is this a better model to actually own the stores outright rather than lease in the first place? How obviously, you have some history with that one of your prior shops? Or does this real estate shift suggest that we may see changes to the existing footprint, whether it's changing locations, kind of relocation type scenario or different sizes, et cetera?Kurt D. BartonScot, this is Kurt. And the real estate model, as you think about the opportunity that we have to drive a strong performance of new stores that we've seen since there's a structural shift in the tailwinds into the rural economy into our markets, the new stores are performing well. We -- as John mentioned, we built a real estate team that is ready to begin to ramp back up to a 90-ish new store. .The sale leaseback of existing stores fits right in with that. We're an asset-light model, do not believe owning stores fit, which is why we have over 95% of our stores under lease. And over time, 30 peers, we've accumulated not strategically a number of owned stores, there's a bit of pent-up value in these stores. And it's a great time right now to use those stores to fuel and be able to keep a cash-neutral value to execute on a strategy that allows us to even further drive new stores, bring efficiency in the new store model. So I look at those -- we look at those very much tied in between as a great way to fund a model that drives greater long runway, greater TSR in the overall long-term algorithm, and I really keep both of those very much tied together as part of a key part of our operations.Scot CiccarelliI'll take the rest offline.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.Michael LasserSo you deemed a 2.5% comp in the second quarter was 500 basis points of like-for-like price inflation. You probably got some demand that was shifted out of 1Q into 2Q. And your guys implied you're going to, call it, 1 to 2 comp for the back half year even as you lag some of the big [price inflation] from last year. So can you give us a sense for what is to accelerate or improve in the business to offset the main contribution from inflation? And have you already started to see that quarter-to-date?Harry A. LawtonMichael. A couple of things. First of all, I wouldn't -- I don't think it's a fair comment to say we had a shift in Q2. We don't have any data or insights or customer purchase data that would suggest that there is a pull or kind of deferral into Q2 or weather-related kind of shifting into Q2. So I would say that's not something that we have said as you think about from a sequential perspective. The second thing I'd say is we have seen comp transactions sequentially improve throughout the quarter and continuing into Q3 and expect that, that will indicate throughout the year. And on AUR, as we've talked about all along, we expect that, that will moderate through the year. Big ticket lessons as a percent as we get through the year. So that provides a bit of a kind of mix benefit. And then lastly, on the UPT, we do think we're at close to the bottom of units per transaction. If you go back and look over the last 15 years at our units per transaction trends, we reached an all-time high in the pandemic, people were stocking up and consolidating their trips. We're now much closer to -- where we were during the 2008 Great Recession and kind of reached that bottom. And so we expect that will be a lesser headwind as we move forward. So when you put those things all together, that ends up with the guidance that we shared. And I think we try to be as conservative as possible on the low end and realistic as possible on the high end.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.Charles P. GromThere's some concern out there that as households continue to revert back to pre-COVID behaviors of some of the gains that Tractors enjoyed over the past 3 years when sales per store has moved from, call it, $4 million to $6 million will be given back. Curious how you'd address this concern and highly the key drivers that attract their temp control in the back half and into '24?Harry A. LawtonChuck, thanks for joining the call. As I think we all know on this call, this has been a question for 18, 24 months. And what I'd say is we continue to see a very healthy customer base. Our active customers were at all-time highs this quarter. We saw positive comp transactions in the quarter. And if you look at the categories that are driving the good steps and driving our customers, it's things like pet, animal, and those are based on accounts of population out there in each of those categories. And so -- and then the last thing I'd point out is our share gain. At least half of the volume that we -- that we've grown over the last handful of years has been share related. And so if I point to share active customers, comp transactions, pet, animal and look at those things. It's just a big different business than many of the other companies that kind of had a pandemic benefit reverted, whether it was technology-related companies that have a user base that shifted online and then pivoted back or maybe something that's home related, electronics related, we're just a very different business and don't see any elements of reversion in our customer bank business.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens.Daniel Robert ImbroHal on who that new customer is, how is the retention trending? I think you mentioned they're younger. So I'm curious, is there a difference in spending power between the most recent vintage of new customers and the historical ones? Are we seeing any change in the neighborhood -- Neighbor's Club adoption? I would think the push toward value makes the loyalty program more valuable. Can you provide any commentary or quantification around how that's trending differently?Harry A. LawtonDaniel, I start out by first thing. We're very pleased with the trends we're seeing in new customers. We had record high new customers in '20 and 2021. As we've talked about on past calls, our neighbor -- and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the Neighbor's Club program being relaunched in April of '21, with incredible time as it allowed us to lock those new customers in. We've grown, I think, it's 15 million members over the last 3 years in our Neighbor's Club program and we've had increased retention rates of our Neighbor's Club program each of the last few years, too. So we've locked those cohorts in. They're growing with us and they're remaining active. Certainly, as we got into 2022 and things balance, we saw our new customer accounts on a year-over basis trend down. That is now leveled out and we feel really good about our new customer trends as we move forward. Sequentially, that should be helpful as we look at year-over-year improvements. On the Neighbor's Club program continue to be very pleased with the 31, 32 million members in Neighbor's Club that we have. Our top tier has grown, and we reached a record number of customers in our top tier. Retention rates remain at all-time highs and continue to improve, and our Neighbor's Club members continue to outcomp our overall base and again, that's on 75% of our sales. So as I've said several times, our customer base is very healthy. Record active customers, positive comp transactions, solid trends in new customers and feel really good as we're heading into the third quarter on our active customer base and our strength of our customer.OperatorOur next question goes to the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays.Seth Ian SigmanSo my question is around the second half guidance, the implied margins. It does seem like you're baking in potentially more margin improvement in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Despite potentially lower comps. And I know some of that now is the sale leaseback. But I guess 2 questions. One, can you just remind us and maybe help bridge some of the drivers for the second half margin expansion? And then second, how do you think about potentially reinvesting more of that margin improvement given the sales performance that you're seeing?Kurt D. BartonSeth, this is Kurt. I'll take the first part of that question, and I'll let Estep, answered the second part in regards to the reinvestment of any margin. The performance on an operating margin standpoint for the second half on a gross margin standpoint will be very similar to second quarter. We continue to see and as we signaled and guided at the beginning of the year, we have strong performance from everyday low pricing. We expect to continue to see transportation being the biggest benefit and fueling of the gross margin expansion. .As a reminder, over the 2 years where transportation costs were a pressure, we absorbed most of that. And this is anticipating some of the transitory we're getting the return on that in 2023. On an SG&amp;A standpoint, what really is -- that's really the big difference in, say, the second half, as you're observing, we expect Q3 on an SG&amp;A standpoint, excluding the sale-leaseback benefit to perform very similar to Q2 in that 70, 80 basis points deleveraged, principally from the investments in the business. But Q4 really has the best compares. And so in line with what we expect to go in the year, when you look back at the fourth quarter of last year where while we had robust sales, we had increased cost in repairs from the storm. We had Orscheln acquisition transition, we had higher incentive compensation. We are lapping that, and we expect in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit from any sale leaseback to really still only have a modest level of SG&amp;A deleverage principally on the compares. So if you hold the gross margin, you get a better performance on SG&amp;A, it's really about how well we're managing the spend. And also can't ignore that the team has done excellent job scaling the cost leveraging investments we made, we are seeing significant efficiencies even SG&amp;A on the distribution and supply chain side of the business, driving lower cost and some efficiencies beyond our expectations. With that, Estep, maybe you can address the second part of that question.Jonathan Seth EstepYes. Thanks, Kurt. Yes, in relation to should we reinvest and how we think about that. First, I would just say EDLP remains our true north. And that strategy continues to pay off for us if you look at the success we're having with our cumulated activity, our transactions and our continued record kind of customer accounts that are coming to Tractor Supply. And our plan is to continue to maintain that EDLP focus and not to revert from that. We will reinvest if we decide we need to, but we do not foresee a need for any meaningful type of reinvestment. And lastly, I would just kind of say is that our inventory position continues to be very strong and very favorable. And as we look ahead to the back half, instead of kind of a reinvestment in margin, we put ourselves in a position to really partner with our key suppliers to go out there, get specialized, go after key values and make sure we have meaningful values for our customers to drive the full basket. So I'm very pleased. I think we have an incredible team. We've got a great reactivity coming forward that we can manage the top line -- we can drive the top line, drive market share, while at the same time, really be able to manage the margin structure as well.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.Peter Sloan BenedictSo I wanted to maybe help speak a little bit more about the historical context here. I mean you started to mention some things in answering Mike Lasser's question, but obviously, we're coming off of a period with COVID, you're starting to see this normalization occur, the behavior of your consumer is changing. Maybe just talk a little bit more about what that means to the credit, the basket trends? And then what we think that kind of indicating here over the next kind of 6 to 12 months? I know you're assuming this will continue in the back half of this year, but how are you just thinking about it longer term?Harry A. LawtonPeter, if you look back over 30 years of this company's cost growth, it's been almost equally split, 50-50 between average ticket and comp transactions. And if you look really at our body of work over the last 3.5 years during the pandemic, there's definitely been periods of time of inflation periods of time of UPT increases. When you look at it collectively, it's about 50-50 comp transactions and average ticket. And that's just the formula that has really just kind of always been there in our historical numbers. .And our expectation as that we navigate current economy that we're operating in and the consumer behaviors that, we will migrate back to that historical blend as we kind of exit this year and move into next year. And there's going to be some imbalances we said in the second half of this year where we expect UPT, the headwind there to kind of level out as we get towards the end of the year. And we expect AUR to kind of come down. Those will work a little bit together. Big ticket becomes a lesser portion of sales. And so we get that mix benefit there. That all works out to an okay average ticket. We're seeing comp transactions increase. That kind of balances a little bit right now and ends up delivering on the kind of implied guidance that we have for the for the second half of the year. On the comp transactions, as I said, we had all-time record active customers this quarter. Our active customer base grew this past quarter. They're shopping us more frequently. We're seeing them do a little bit of deconsolidation of their trips, as Kurt mentioned, but we're also gaining significant share in footsteps. And in categories like pet food, where we continue to take substantial share we're really viewed as kind of a value played out a warehouse like model. I mean our average pet food bag size is 35 pounds. And that's very different than, say, pet specialty and others. And if you look at a price per pound basis, I mean we can be as good as 20% -- 25%, 30% advantage on a price per pound basis. And -- so we're just -- that naturally drives split steps in our stores. So the mix will evolve a little bit throughout the balance of this year, but we've certainly bought it all through and expect that over time, it will revert back to its historical performance of kind of a 50-50 blend.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.Peter Jacob KeithI wanted to just follow up on the real estate strategy and just putting in the context of your long-term algorithm. Is it meaningful enough that perhaps some of those targets on an annualized basis be I'm just looking specifically at the sales growth target of 6% to 7% and then EPS growth target of 8% to 11%?Kurt D. BartonPeter, this is Kurt. The new real estate model, one of the many things that we're excited about is not only does it give us a long runway, but to your point, you move from 70 to 90 stores a year is driving incremental sales. Those new stores have been expected to have a consistent tailwind into the comps. We believe this new real estate strategy not only gives us a longer runway, but really strengthens the long-term algorithm, gives us more confidence in that and bolster the higher end of that. Midyear through the year, when we typically don't and aren't adjusting our long-term guidance, we certainly will factor all of that in, along with the outlook for 2024. As we reported on our Q4 earnings, typically refreshing any adjustments to our long-term target at this point. But we're excited about what to do to the long-term algorithm and the overall total shareholder return.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.Brian William NagelSo the question I have, maybe just dig a little bit deeper to the comps around the trends in seasonal sales. What -- you talked a lot about weakness or follows similar to what we saw in Q1. But any geographic differences that you noticed? And then as we move on into Q3, recognizing you have driven guidance a year. Did you see any type of rebound in seasonal sales as maybe some of these weather some not all of historic abate?Harry A. LawtonYes, Brian. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the seasonal business was kind of on expectations in the months of April and May. We talked about that in our earnings calls for Q1, given kind of a quarter-to-date perspective on that. And also just our commentary through the quarter publicly. And then June, as I mentioned, we saw a significant underperforming seasonal business. And that was really the bulk of our miss in the entire quarter with our seasonal business in the month of June. As I mentioned, there was a topsy-turvy quarter particularly in the month of June with all the various environmental conditions that were out there. But to your point, we did see bright spots at moments in time throughout the quarter as well as certain parts of the geography. As an example, the kind of 10 days leading up to Memorial Day were very good from a seasonal perspective and total business perspective. So sun shine out almost across the entire in the country. And we had a really good 10-day run there. Historically, you see something like that for at least a few weeks over the spring, we just only had that kind of short period. But if you look at the Southeast and the South Atlantic, as Kurt called out, we had excellent performance there. From time to time in the both Texas home at Far West, when we had good seasonal performance, we had strong -- I mean, good weather, we had seasonal performance there. And then kurt called out some of our underperforming regions around the Midwest and the Northeast and the Midwest went straight from winter to drought. And in the month of June, it ranged 21 days in the Northeast. And so the -- those were large contributors to the underperformance in the month of June. So anyway, that's just a little bit of more depth and commentary there, Brian.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.Zachary Robert FademHal, you had hinted at another iteration of the Neighbor's Club program at some point in 2024. So first of all, can you talk about the lift -- the comp lift you saw in the last time you updated the program? And is there any info you can share on the types of changes that are on the table that you think could make the program better?Harry A. LawtonZach, very perceptive. First off, I'd say on the comps, it's hard to calculate that, both given the magnitude of the comps that we had in that period. But what I -- given the magnitude, but what I would say is we can absolutely look at the 15 million Neighbor's Club members that we've added over the last few years, and when they started to shop with us and how we lock them in using the Neighbor's Club program, and I spoke to that many times, but we feel great on the cohorts from that first revision of our Neighbor's Club program. .As we move ahead, there's a lot of -- we've been getting a lot of feedback from our customers and how we can make it even better in the next version. Doing some things to uniquely call out certain characteristics of customers if they're say a horse owner or say a military better, what can we do to better tailor that when they self-identify. There's also things we can do on our rewards and maybe bite sizing the rewards at giving some $5 awards instead of always $10 rewards. We're also looking at a way to add, say, [$4], perhaps even the fifth year. As we mentioned, we've got our largest number of highest value customers ever, how do we actually take it up another tier and you get further rewards for those that are in that tier. So looking at a lot of ways that, again, it's the program locks our customers in. It encourages spin, it encourage migration, it really encourages purchasing on big ticket and then redemption on the CUE businesses. We're just looking for ways to reinforce that more and also make it more personable for our customers. And the team is hard to work on it. We have more detail on it. We look forward to sharing it.OperatorOur final question will go to the line of Stephen Zaccone with Citigroup.Steven Emanuel ZacconeSo I wanted to just go back to the sales guidance change. Just to better understand how much of the change in sales guidance is really the seasonal missing expectations versus the discretionary being a bit weaker? In one sense, the first half was really choppy with weather throughout the year as you've discussed. So that would be helpful. And then when you think about getting back to mid-single digit comps, which is the original guidance. What's the biggest kind of drivers to get you back to that trend in the business?Kurt D. BartonStephen, this is Kurt. I appreciate the question. The -- as we talked about when Brian asked the question on Q2 back to the fact that, a bit of Q2's performance you have to acknowledge that as we saw some differentiation between some of the geographies, that indicates weather was a contributor. But even in some of the strong geographies and across all that, we saw a pullback on some of the discretionary. We're going into the second half acknowledging that it's a different seasonal period of time, particularly in the Q4. We plan for base weather. We do not plan for more favorable weather. And at this point, on the seasonal categories, unless we look at it as base and unless there's a strong demand for our product because of a shift in weather seasonal, the consumer on some of the discretionary items is a little bit more prudent on that today. And then also, we acknowledge, as I mentioned, some of the impulse in discretionary categories. So we anticipate that the consumer behavior is in line with the first half of the year. We're taking a reasonable prudent approach there. And then we're also factoring in the strong winter storm that we had in the fourth quarter that we're lapping up against. But underpinning all of that, is a strength in our year-round core business running in the mid-single digits, comp transactions still performing strong at this point, and we've got a really good, healthy customer. Hal mentioned some of the shifts that we've seen, UPT coming some of it ties.As you revert back to the mid-single digits, it's really a matter of UPT, and the consumer coming off of the cycle as we've seen in the last couple of quarters and really having more strength in the size of their basket and the demand for the discretionary, and we could be a couple of quarters away from that, and we factored into our guidance. Our guidance is reasonable. We're not factoring in a favorable shift in the consumer or a strong shift in favorable weather. It's taken all those factors that we've seen year-to-date as well as some of the headwinds in the second half. .OperatorThat will conclude our question-and-answer session. So at this time, I will pass the conference back over to Mary Winn for closing remarks.Mary Winn PilkingtonThank you, Megan. This will conclude our call. I am available for any questions or follow-ups. So please feel free to reach out, and we look forward to speaking to you at our Q3 earnings call in October. So thank you. .OperatorThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful day.]"

In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 10.9% year over year to $955.4 million and beat our estimate of $867.9 million.

I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong broad-based top line growth during the first half of the year. Our strong performance was driven by effective pricing, combined with healthy volume growth in 3 of our 4 regions. Europe was a lone exception due to expected disruption driven by retailer negotiation. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, and we see robust momentum and solid consumer confidence across geographies and categories. We successfully implemented our planned price increases in Europe, closing our customer negotiations in line with expectations. With this behind us, we feel good about the remainder of the year in Europe.We also feel good about continued consumer confidence. We continue to drive robust demand in our core categories across the vast majority of our businesses, resulting in both value and volume growth. Our strong profit dollar growth was driven by cost discipline and pricing to offset cost inflation. We continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and portfolio reshaping initiatives to accelerate and compound growth. And we remain confident that our proven strategy delivered by our world-class team positions us well to deliver another strong year. Based on the strength of our first half performance and our latest view across businesses, we are raising our full year organic net revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook to 12% plus.Turning to Slide 5. You can see that the first half of 2023 showed continued momentum across our entire business. We delivered first half organic net revenue growth of $2.7 billion, up nearly 18% versus prior year and significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full year 2022. This includes a 15.8% growth for the quarter. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of more than $1 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year's pace with 18.9% growth. We're proud of our team's continued focus and agility, which enable us to continue investing to drive further growth acceleration. Our A&amp;C investment is increasing 18% in the first half of the year. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth of close to $600 million, up 23% and again, well ahead of last year's pace.On Slide 6, you can see a few examples of our brand acceleration strategy in action. Our continued investments in creative assets, personalization at scale and innovation, combined with strong in-store execution, are resulting in continued sales growth and brand loyalty increases in our core categories of chocolates, biscuits and big snacks.For example, in China, we launched Oreo Airy Cake in March. Driven by the strength of the Oreo name as the world's favorite cookie, this new packaged cake already has achieved a 3.5% market share and 80% of the velocity of its leading competitor in large stores. And China is one of our most important emerging markets. This is just one example of numerous innovations to expand our key brands into adjacent spaces and formats.We're also continuing to renovate our recipes to stay a step ahead of changing consumer and customer tastes. For instance, we recently launched our first under 100 calories Cadbury treat for adults. This is a great example of our commitment to help consumers snack mindfully. We are offering a broader range of portion-controlled packs and products but also our portion control education campaigns both digitally and on pack.In the baked snacks segment, we continue to accelerate both top and bottom line performance in Clif Bar. We remain focused on improving service levels and supply chain efficiencies while further advancing productivity and effectiveness in our media spend and continuing to strengthen brand equity.We're also continuing to introduce new culturally relevant flavors to strengthen consumer loyalty for our local jewel brands. For example, Lacta has been a leader in Brazilian chocolate for over 110 years. Following the successful launch of Lacta tablets filled with Oreo, we recently rolled out 2 new line extensions filled with additional Lacta products that Brazilians already know and love. The Sonho de Valsa Bomboms made with chocolate and cashew nut filling as well as Ouro Branco candies made with wafers filled with chocolate cream and covered in white chocolate.These are just a few examples of the innovative ways our teams are driving growth in our iconic chocolate, biscuits and baked snack franchises, continuously investing in new formats, pack sizes and flavor combinations that drive incrementality and encourage consumers to experience our brands in new ways.Within the baked snacks segment, we're especially excited about our strong performance in the rapidly growing cakes and pastry space. Let's take a closer look on Slide 7.Earlier, I mentioned the Oreo Airy Cake in China as a great example of our brand acceleration efforts in emerging markets. Similarly, in developed markets, we're making solid progress in expanding our successful cookie and chocolate franchises into chocobakery, cakes and pastries. For instance, in the United States, Oreo Cakesters are continuing to perform well. Since the recent launch of this fan favorite, it already has earned a 3.7% share of packaged snack cakes.Give &amp; Go is another solid success story in our North America baked snacks lineup, where we're continuing to drive distribution and innovation. Share is up 0.5 point year-to-date, driven by solid pricing execution, expansion into adjacencies such as mini donuts and strong category demand.Meantime, in Europe, 7Days continues to advance its position as the #1 packaged croissant, and we have exciting plans to continue to grow its footprint beyond Europe, including recent test-and-learn trials in a number of emerging markets.Turning to Slide 8. We continue to invest in digital commerce and revenue growth management tools and capabilities to support our brands while strengthening our partnerships with leading customers. I'm pleased to share that we have achieved the #1 market share position in digital commerce in our top 5 markets of the United States, China, United Kingdom, France and Brazil, while over-delivering in up-and-coming emerging markets such as India, Philippines, Brazil, Mexico and Poland, which are up 40% year-to-date.We continue accelerating eB2B capabilities to expand distribution and strengthen our partnerships with key customers. Additionally, our increased investments in elevating RGM strategies and actions are driving strong value realization, helping to offset inflationary pressures. We have appointed dedicated RGM leadership and teams in all key markets, supported with new proprietary data and analytics assessments, digital tools and a comprehensive training program. We are confident that these ongoing investments will deliver sustainable improvements in growth, efficiency and ultimately, margin.Along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress in advancing our environmental, social and governance strategy. In May, we published our annual Snacking Made Right report, reinforcing our 2025 goals and documenting our latest performance in priority areas. These include sourcing key ingredients more sustainably, reducing carbon emissions and increasing recyclable packaging. We are also improving performance in social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion, both internally and in partnership with our suppliers as well as helping consumers snack more mindfully through improved portion education and increased focus on single portion packs.We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale across these important areas is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders. We encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report for more details and context on our progress.With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials.Luca ZaramellaThank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q2 marked another strong quarter for our business. Double-digit organic net revenue growth across each region, sound pricing execution, strong profit dollar growth and significant brand reinvestment enabled us to continue driving sustainable value creation.Revenue grew plus 15.8% with strong volume/mix growth in North America, Latin America and AMEA. Overall, volume/mix was flat for the quarter despite the expected customer disruption in Europe. Recall, last year's Q2 total company volume/mix was plus 5%, making this performance even more impressive.Emerging markets grew more than 23% with strong performance across significant numbers of markets, while developed markets grew 11% with balanced trends from both North America and Europe and despite customer disruption.Turning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy businesses all posted another quarter of double-digit increases in Q2. Biscuits increased plus 13.9%. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Give &amp; Go, TUC and Club Social all delivered double-digit growth. Clif, though not inorganic, also posted strong growth. Chocolate grew plus 13.7% with strength in both developed and emerging markets. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta, Toblerone all delivered double-digit increases.We are very pleased with the performance of our core categories of chocolate and biscuits, which, albeit impacted in the quarter by customer disruption, are on a solid trajectory. For both, we expect good volume momentum as we move forward in the year now that negotiations in Europe are behind us.Gum &amp; Candy grew more than 30% with strength across our business units, especially in emerging markets.Now let's review market and share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 70% of our revenue base. The U.S. continues to make service level improvements and ended Q2 with good on-shelf availability and inventory levels.Moving to Page 14. We delivered more than $540 million in gross profit growth or 20% in Q2 driven by top line productivity and cost discipline. This also resulted in year-over-year gross margin expansion in all regions except Europe, which was impacted by expected customer disruption. Now that pricing is implemented, we expect improvements in Europe, too. This growth provides significant fuel to invest behind our brands as well as significant earnings flow-through.Moving to regional performance on Slide 15. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all regions while also delivering volume/mix increases in all regions but Europe that got impacted by pricing-related disruption. This growth translated into operating leverage and OI dollar growth across the board. Europe grew plus 13.1% with double-digit OI growth. Importantly, pricing has now been landing, and we expect that this will lead to a better second half volume and margin performance.Overall, the consumer remains resilient with elasticities holding up relatively well in chocolate and biscuit, while we saw some incremental elasticity in part of our Cheese &amp; Grocery business. North America grew plus 12.4%, with OI dollar growth of more than 29%, driven by higher pricing, volume/mix of 2% and strength from both our base biscuits business and our ventures, such as Give &amp; Go, Perfect Snacks and Tate's. Tate's also posted robust growth and delivered another operating margin increase of double-digit in percentage points in Q2 versus last year. Now profitability is approaching the level of total North America, but we still have to generate material synergies, both on revenue and cost line. So Clif is a business that is growing, has now some margins and still with meaningful synergy potential.AMEA grew 13.2% with solid volume/mix growth of more than 3%. OI dollars increased plus 4.2%. India, China, Southeast Asia all posted strong top line growth for the quarter. Latin America grew more than 37% with OI dollar growth of nearly 65%. Mexico, Western Andean countries and Brazil all turned in robust quarters. Ricolino remains on track in terms of integration, and we expect to begin capturing more benefits towards the end of the year.Next to EPS on Slide 16. In the quarter, EPS grew plus 21.5% in constant currency or nearly 17% on reported dollars. Turning to Slide 17. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion in the first half with $1.7 billion in return of capital to shareholders. We also announced today an increase in our dividend of plus 10%, marking a double-digit increase in 8 of the last 9 years of the history of Mondelez.Turning to our outlook on Page 19. Given the strength of our Q2 and first half performance, the successful conclusion of our negotiations in Europe, the strong volume momentum of our brands, we are raising our full year outlook for both revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We now expect top line growth of 12% plus versus our original outlook of 5% to 7% and most recent outlook of 10% plus. EPS growth is also expected to be 12% plus versus our prior outlook of 10% plus and the original outlook of high single digits. Note, our free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at $3.3 billion given $400 million in cash taxes related to the sell-down and exit of our KDP position.In terms of key assumptions, we continue to expect a double-digit inflation increase for '23 driven by elevated cost in packaging, ingredients, labor and lapping favorable commodity hedges in 2022. With respect to interest expense, we now expect $380 million for the year given recent coffee asset monetization and term loan reductions. We also expect to end the year around mid-2s in terms of leverage based on current conditions. As a reminder, given the liquidation of our KDP position in middle of July, there will be no dividend income recorded in half 2. We now expect $0.11 of EPS of headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.09 in our prior outlook. The outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in the year, ongoing resilience of consumer consumptions in our categories, relatively benign elasticities, continued brand reinvestment and completion of pricing in Europe as well as health of our emerging markets. This current outlook does not consider a material deterioration of geopolitical environment surrounding some areas of our business.With that, let's open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.Andrew LazarAppreciate it. First off, Dirk, we've heard so far from a bunch of food companies that have reported earnings of some maybe very recent changes in things like consumer behavior, retailer inventory destocking, competitiveness and maybe generally greater sluggishness in category volumes as pricing has lapped. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the landscape as it relates to Mondelez specifically and any changes sort of one way or the other that are notable for you?Dirk Van de PutOkay. Thanks, Andrew. Well, based on H1, we obviously feel quite good about how our portfolio is performing. We have brought growth in the different regions, in the different categories across most of our brands. The pricing went through quite well, strong pricing, I would say, compared to others. We have very good volume/mix growth in 3 out of 4 regions. And the only region that was disrupted was Europe, but that was due to customer disruption. And we foresee, for the second half, that we will see solid volume growth in Europe.Our share is increasing. North America is finally recovered. We're gaining share in AMEA. Europe, of course, still a bit of a drag on share, but that's, again, because of this client disruption. You see that our emerging markets are doing quite well broadly in the top and the bottom line. So we are generating good gross profit, so we can continue to invest strongly in our brands and our capabilities. The acquisitions are doing well. I would point to Clif. And yes, we have double-digit growth in adjusted and real EPS. So the whole picture, for us, looks pretty good.If I look a little bit further on the environment, at least in our categories, we see strong consumer confidence. We would say that it's improving in the developed and in the emerging markets. And the price sensitivity seems to be plateauing. Particularly the emerging market consumer, I would say, is very, very solid. If I think about competition, I think the big difference between us and the competition will be that we have a very strong top line combined with some good volume growth.Promo levels, we see some increase in promo levels in biscuits, but it's largely flat and down somewhere else. We even see promo prices going up faster than non-promo prices in percentage. From a pricing perspective, we have done as what was needed. So most of our '23 pricing is taken. North America was already done in December of last year. Europe was closed, in line with expectations in Q2, and emerging markets are exactly on plan. And then the elasticity, we don't see a change in the elasticity, which has been low as you know. We do see consumers shopping around more, hoping to find deals. The quantity bag per shopping trip is the same, but they tend to shop a little bit less frequently, but nothing really that preoccupies us.And so to close, I would say, the volume is strong. Europe will recover in the second half, and this will be the strongest H1. And we believe here that we have delivered as Mondelez. So we think we are quite -- doing quite well there.Maybe a few words on Europe, which is probably the most important thing for us. It obviously has been, for us, a very dynamic environment. Top line demand has been quite good, 13.1% growth, but the volume/mix was down 4.5 points, but that was due primarily through that client disruption. I want to reemphasize that all 2023 client negotiations have closed successfully, and now the pricing was landed in line with plan. We will see some inflationary costs continuing in cocoa and sugar going into 2024. And we are planning to do some strong investments in the second half in Europe. So if you think that through and you say, okay, these pricing negotiations are behind us, we are positive on H2. And so what you could expect for H2 in Europe is that our volumes will grow. We are ready to execute in store. We have planned key promotions because now with this negotiation behind us, we can go full force again.I think as a consequence of that, you will see our share improve. We also start lapping prior year headwinds. And our margins will start to recover as the pricing is now fully implemented. So I think 3 levels of good news, volume, share and margins.Our categories continue to do well. Consumers seem to prioritize them. Also in Europe, elasticities remain low despite some strong price inflation. Yes, if you talk about our cheese or grocery categories, there, we see a little bit of an uptick in elasticity, but that's a smaller percentage of our business. HFSS in the U.K. looks pretty manageable at this stage. The consumer is adjusting to the changes that they see in store. We see a bigger impact on seasonal and gifting, but the impact on standard chocolate seems to be minor. So I would say the main news that we have is that we are expecting a good second half for Europe on top of all the other things. Hope that gives you a picture, Andrew.Andrew LazarYes. No, really, really complete, so I appreciate that. One very quick one for Luca. The company raised constant currency EPS growth expectations to 12% plus from 10% plus. I guess consensus is already relatively close to the 12% mark. So I guess I'm just curious how investors should think about the plus in the guide.Luca ZaramellaThank you, Andrew. Yes. Before I go to the plus part, maybe briefly to provide some color on what underpins the new outlook. I think there are 3 important drivers to point to in terms of our new outlook. One, it is clearly the strong first half and importantly, the quality of the results we are posting. I'm particularly happy with the operating part of the EPS growth. Second, I think it is really the underlying broad-based trends of our business, the resilience of our brands. I'm happy with volume and value growth and the continued investment. And third, as we mentioned a few times, Europe with price fully landing and in line with expectations.So maybe a word briefly by geography. Emerging markets are on a roll. We are quite happy. Some pricing is causing some areas of concern in terms of elasticity, but those are the minority of the market and not really important in the big scheme of things. The U.S. and North America are posting a terrific P&amp;L, and we are very pleased with Clif. And Europe has improved profitability already in Q2, but as we said last quarter, at that time, we had 80% of the price implemented. Now that pricing is 100% secured, we expect volume and revenue growth as well as margin improvement for Europe.So quite frankly, there is a good chance that we exceed the 12% plus guidance, but I prefer having another quarter under the belt and then narrow guidance for Q4. If all things play out as we have in mind, as I said, there are good chances we will exceed the guidance. Bear in mind that we want to start 2024 strong. And so if there is upside in terms of profitability and EPS, we might decide to reinvest selectively some of the upside to get really a fast start into 2024, too.OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneI got 2 questions, 1 on the net interest guidance and the second 1 on Clif. So maybe first one for you, Luca. Net interest expense guidance came down again, I think, by about $20 million versus where we were coming out of 1Q. And I just want to make sure. I think you paid off a $750 million term loan with the KDP proceeds. So is this just simply a function of half a year interest savings on paying the term loan off? Or is there anything else that drove the lower net interest expense?Luca ZaramellaNo, that is it. It is debt coming down. You're going to see a good leverage as we end the year. We plan to be at like 2.5x that, which is quite good. And yes, it is as simple us paying down the term loan.Bryan Douglass SpillaneOkay. And then, Dirk, in your prepared comments, you talked about Clif pretty encouragingly, right, in terms of the margins approaching, I guess, the segment level, and then there's more synergy. And then it sounds like you're also expanding on revenue. So can you just maybe give us a little bit of a progress report on kind of where you stand with Clif today relative to where it was when you acquired it? Is your integration and is the acquisition model kind of running ahead of expectations and just how we should think about maybe how impactful Clif might be as we look forward?Dirk Van de PutYes. So we've seen in the first half very strong double-digit revenue growth, and the margins, the OI margin versus previous year is up more than 1,000 basis points. So we've increased prices, some of the first thing I would say. We've increased prices more aggressively than Clif would have done historically. We increased prices in August, in January and another one later in Q1. And so we see low elasticity, I would say. So that's having a big impact.The second big thing that we are doing is the service has improved. We reduced SKUs. And we started to operate the plants a little bit better, and so that has given to a good increase in the service level. Then we changed the promotional plan. That has successfully kicked off. Fourth thing is that our media buying is more efficient than theirs. So we were able to also get some benefits from that. So those are some of the things we've done. The integration is taking place in a number of steps. Like a big one is the systems integration later on in the year. But so far, where we have streamlined the teams and we've brought more clarity on how we want to operate the business, that is all going well.But as we said in the prepared remarks, that the real benefit of the cost synergies is still largely to come. We've already seen some benefits, but it's in the second half of this year and beginning of next year that we will get the real benefit from it. So I would say you can probably make the calculation. It's close to a $1 billion business. That improves its margin by the amount that I was quoting, so that will have a reasonable impact on the total company.OperatorOur next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.David Sterling PalmerA question on Europe pricing and the impact on volume. You mentioned the pricing is complete. How are you thinking about the volume for that region in the second half given that some of that disruption is behind you and you're lapping some disruption in the second half versus '22?Dirk Van de PutYes. So as I said, we don't really give volume guidance per region, but we would see some solid volume growth in the second half driven by exactly the factors that you were saying. So we have the pricing negotiations behind us. That pricing will be implemented. The disruption is gone. Last year, in the second half, we increased our prices in Europe, and we had more disruption. We will lap that. So that's going to have a benefit for us. We have elasticities in Europe that are relatively benign. So despite the newly implemented pricing, we don't think that that's going to have a major effect on the volume. So without giving you the number, it's going to be a nice solid volume growth for the second half.David Sterling PalmerAnd then I couldn't help but notice, you featured cake and pastries a couple of times in your slides. And it seems like a logical extension to have Oreo have a snack cake, but I wonder how big could your aspirations be in that category. It doesn't seem as big as some of your other categories. So I'm wondering, do you see snack cakes and pastries being an ongoing sizable growth contributor? And maybe give us a sense of how you think about the TAM there, the opportunity there and how you're going to go about it.Dirk Van de PutYes. So well, first of all, cakes and pastries is not a small category. It's not the size of biscuits, but it's not too far away from it. And so it's a big opportunity around the world. It's a very fragmented category with sometimes relatively commoditized products in there. But there is a real opportunity to bring strong brands with high-quality products. And so that's really the play that we're going forward through an Oreo Airy Cake in China or Cakesters here in the U.S. or Give &amp; Go in the fresh section or a Chipita in Europe with prepackaged croissants for instance.So we think that there is a whole play for us there. At the moment, we're around the 3%, 4% market share of the whole category, so plenty of room to go. With that, we are already the #2 player, and so that indicates how fragmented it is. The category itself has been growing quite nicely over the past 3 years. It is a category that exists across all markets. It covers different occasions than our typical biscuits and chocolate, so that makes it very interesting for them.And so we think with these new quality products and our brands, we can really make a significant impact. And I'm not going to give an exact number, but we would expect that our cakes and pastry business in the coming year should double or triple and lift us up to close to a 10% market share. So for us, it's going to be a significant contribution to the growth of the company.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.Kenneth B. GoldmanI wanted to ask, as we look at the futures charts for cocoa and sugar, they might indicate that, theoretically, right, down the road, some additional pricing might be needed to offset more inflation. I appreciate you're not in a position today, right, to talk about pricing that hasn't been announced. But just conceptually, is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able or willing to, if needed, raise list prices again, especially if European elasticities, I guess, maybe aren't that bad and you're -- given your commentary about some improve or improving consumer confidence?Luca ZaramellaThank you for the question, Ken. Look, the increase in sugar and cocoa specifically is material. I mean we are talking about most likely a 30-plus percent if you look at the last 12 months or even more, particularly in cocoa. I think when you look at the quality of the brands, we said the fact that we had invested materially around the world in our brands, the fact that there are strong bonds with consumers, and I believe pricing is -- will be a necessity in chocolate.I'm not going to elaborate on the details. Also, bear in mind that, particularly in emerging markets, we are going to be very mindful about not vacating price point, and so we will use RGM. And then over the last couple of years, I would say we have learned the ins and outs of implementing pricing around the world. And I think it is needed, and we're going to do it most likely.Kenneth B. GoldmanAnd then just one quick follow-up. Are there any peculiarities or cadence issues we should think about that are not necessarily obvious? Just as we model 3Q versus 4Q, any timing or headwinds or tailwinds that might not be apparent at first glance if I could say it?Luca ZaramellaNo. Look, I don't think there is anything that you're going to see in terms of outliers that are going to cause material issues or material opportunities in Q3. You're going to see a volume rebound in Europe. As a consequence, I think, obviously, there is going to be a better situation for the totality of the company.I'm not going to guide you exactly on gross profit, but you're going to see double-digit, most likely, revenue growth and double-digit EBIT growth. Below the line, the items can vary. But I think when you really look at Q3, Q4, you're going to see strong operating gains coming through the P&amp;L.And I didn't talk a lot about cash flow but very happy with that, too. And you're going to see us delivering the cash flow despite the $400 million headwind related to the coffee KDP sales.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareySo just one follow-up and then just a second question around the guidance commentary. But Luca, I think you said that you expected leverage at the end of the year to be in the 2.5x range. That would be a historically low level for the company. At that level, how should we be thinking about deployment of capital at that point? You repurchase more shares. You have too many deals recently. And clearly, you're doing great work on Clif. So is there low-hanging fruit on what you've already added?It just stood out to me that you'll be trending toward a historically low level of leverage. And at that point, I think there's going to be probably some observations around what that capacity could be used for.And then just one other quick follow-up on the EPS upside comment for the full year. There was also a comment just around spending back, right? So like how do you think about, as we get through the year, this concept, okay, there could be some upside, but you're also quite committed to the spending back. Like where does that kind of tension play out, right? Volumes get weaker. You're going to spend back more. If not, there's some upside. Just maybe any context on that as well. So thanks for that on the leverage and just the upside versus investment.Luca ZaramellaYes. No, I think the first thing first is the underlying strength of the EBITDA in the business. So we are converting cash quite well from net income that is coming. And that is the first element of the equation. The second one is the fact that we are going to get $1.3-plus billion of proceeds from the gum sale, and that will further enhance the situation. I'm not going to tell you that we are going to run the company forever at this level of leverage, but reality is absent M&amp;A, I think this is most likely a little bit of a new norm.What you have also to keep in mind is both in the case of Clif and Ricolino, we are doing quite a good job in terms of integration. And I think deployment of capital behind M&amp;A, particularly, has been something that the company has done well. Capital allocation behind fleet, we quoted a few numbers. I think this is a great opportunity, and it shows that we can generate quite a bit of value through M&amp;A.We don't control necessarily time of M&amp;A. But on the M&amp;A, if something comes along, we're going to be on it. Also, bear in mind that there are parts of the portfolio that we might decide eventually to divest down the road. So I think from a leverage standpoint, we are really in a good shape. The EPS upside, the -- one of the things I believe that is delivering volume growth for us, it is the fact that, yes, we price, but we continue to invest in the business not only in terms of A&amp;C but also quality and other things. We talked a little bit earlier in the year about the Milka relaunch in Europe and the improved formula as one example.And what I meant by EPS upside is we clearly have in mind the fact that we might have a little bit of headroom in terms of profitability. And we want to use a little bit of that headroom selectively in some places to really go after incremental distribution opportunities, to really go after incremental investments such as we get a good start into 2024. It will be on a case by case, but we consistently ask around the business, do you have opportunities to accelerate. And we do it on a quarterly basis, and so stay tuned. You'll learn more as we post Q3 results.OperatorOur next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.Jason M. EnglishLook, I want to pull on that thread you just brought up, the opportunity to drive accelerating growth, invest, find distribution. I believe in the past, you've outlined some of the distribution opportunities you see in front of you in Brazil and Southeast Asia and India as well as the opportunity that's coming on the back of the Ricolino acquisition. Can you update us on where those opportunities lie, how much progress you've made and how much progress is to be had?Dirk Van de PutYes. The opportunities typically lie in the emerging markets in the first place. And so the countries that you should be thinking about are India and China where we have been going at the rate of well over 100,000 to 200,000 new stores every year. That is going to continue, that speed at which we continue to grow. We do the same in Southeast Asia, and we're also looking at opportunities to do something similar in Latin America. So that's the #1 driver of what we think. And you should think about it at the same pace as what it has been in the last 2, 3 years.The second one is, we call it going broader, which means that we can start to increase the range of our products that are available in stores, also, again, largely in emerging markets. That's another big driver of our distribution. China has started to do that in the last 2, 3 years. And that's going pretty well for us. And so that's a second sort of front that we are working on around the world.And then the last one is the acquisitions where we are starting to do test and learn with these products in different markets around the world. So we have a number of tests and learns going on in Chipita. We have some Grenade test and learns. We will have some Clif test and learns around the world. And we are expecting that from that, we will learn which countries those would have a big opportunity to start being distributed. So that, you should see as a third front.In the first 2, 3 years, I wouldn't expect that you would see a major impact on our numbers. But later on, as these things take shape, I think that will start to play a significant role. If I think order of magnitude that you should think about it, if I think about in India or in China, I would say 1/3 of the growth is driven by distribution expansion. So that gives you an order of magnitude.OperatorOur next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities.John Joseph BaumgartnerI wanted to stick with the emerging markets, but maybe in the context of local brands. It looks as though the market share growth has stalled out a bit in the last couple of quarters, at least in Europe. And maybe that's a function of the success of global brands sort of crowding out the locals. But if you could elaborate there, just on resource allocation, where you are at this point, what are the expectations for locals across the portfolio going forward and how you think about the ability for globals and locals to grow share simultaneously? Because I think, historically, the largest opportunities you have to recover lost share in locals is Eastern Europe, Asia, chocolate biscuits. So curious about your thoughts there.Dirk Van de PutYes. So well, first of all, I would say Europe, you have to be a bit careful because you have the whole client disruption going through there. So if our share is affected, that has to see with the client disruption. But if I think about the performance of global and local brands, it is true that global brands have started to grow faster, I would say. We have a number of brands, particularly an Oreo, Milka, Cadbury but also Trident as a gum brand, for example, or Halls, which are recuperating post COVID.So you have a number of global brands who -- the Oreo and Milka category is normal, but then you get an extra boost from things like Trident and Halls, which were not growing that much. We, for instance, are also working very hard on our Toblerone premiumization.So yes, at this stage, global brands are growing faster. They're well into the 20s. While local jewels are probably more in the mid-teens growth, still not bad. But that's a little bit the effect as I explained to you.Does that mean that we have changed our resource allocation? No, not at all. And if anything, we're pushing our local teams to make sure that our local jewels get significant resources allocated to it because we believe that the opportunity is there.And so I wouldn't read too much into it. For instance, if you look at the 4-year CAGR, our global brands are double digits, while our local jewels are high single digits, so very close to each other. And that's really what I would point to. So we don't necessarily see anything there that would preoccupy us.OperatorOur last question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.Michael Scott LaveryI just wanted to follow up Dave Palmer's question about bakery. And maybe specifically, just with Give &amp; Go, you mentioned how bringing branded and quality products was sort of the key to unlocking share gains and growth there. But fresh seems less branded and maybe sometimes very little branding. Is it opportunity there? How much can you push that maybe in certain subsegments? And then as far as geographically explaining that, is there an opportunity for that as well?Dirk Van de PutYes. Well, yes, when I talked about the branded part, I was talking more about the packaged cakes and pastries. And so if you think about Give &amp; Go as a fresh business, branded can play a role, and I can explain you a little bit how we think about that. But it's largely driven through innovation, I would say, the growth of the Give &amp; Go business and extra distribution. So you have to think about Give &amp; Go as a player that makes mini cakes and pastries, so mini cupcakes, mini muffins, mini brownies, mini donuts. And that's a very interesting segment. It's a to-buy segment, and they do a great job in offering a quality product.Now we can make those products with some of our ingredients. So you can imagine a cupcake with Oreo on top of it. And so the branding can play a role. They've also started to develop their own brands. So it can play a role in Give &amp; Go, but your observation is correct that it's more in the packaged part of things.Now the in-store bakery is very interesting for retailers in North America, but it's also happening in other parts of the world. We were in Australia, for instance, and one of the retailers there, their main interest was to talk to us about in-store bakery and how we could activate it together with them. The reason being that the other big benefit of Give &amp; Go business is that it saves on labor. So you now get a product delivered to your store that is freeze and thaw, and you can avoid all the labor in store, and so that drives a big interest from the retailer on top. The consumer sees it as fresh. There is high interest. It's a section they want to increase. So I would certainly confirm that there is a growing interest around the world for fresh bakery.Michael Scott LaveryThat's great color. And just a follow-up on emerging markets, too. It sounds like there's strength broadly even in China. But can you just help us understand the Chinese consumer a little bit? Is your performance there doing well a function of a relatively low kind of accessible price point? Is it more food at home that's doing well? Can you just maybe unpack a little bit where the Chinese consumer is and how that fits with your portfolio?Dirk Van de PutYes, yes. So China grew double digit for us in Q2. One of the key effects that you need to think about is that we have a big gum business there. And as we are coming out of COVID, kind of strange. Nobody talks about COVID anymore in China, but the mobility is coming back, and so we have growth coming on our gum business. And on top of that, we have had a continued strong biscuit growth, which is more home consumption.In both cases, we are increasing our share. Biscuits is up almost 1 point in Q2 through very strong brand activations, and we're particularly happy with the success that Chips Ahoy! is having now as our second big biscuit brand next to Oreo in China. And then gum share is up 2.5 points, where we started to do some very targeted activations in lower-tier cities.The other thing that's particular about Chinese that digital commerce is about 20% of sales. And in Q2, digital commerce is starting to -- started to grow quite considerably at a 23% growth rate. So that all points towards -- or on-the-go consumption because in China, digital commerce can be sometimes delivered in a very short period of time but also home consumption of course.The other thing to explain our China growth is that distribution expansion I was talking about in the previous question. So in Q2 alone, we've added 60,000 new stores in the super and mini channels as a part of that go deeper route-to-market strategy.And the last one I would point to is innovation. We launched that Oreo Airy Cake. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. And that's that expansion into baked snacks and cakes and pastries for us.So those are all the elements that are driving our Chinese growth. I think it's pretty solid for the quarters and years to come. We can work on all these fronts. We can continue to add distribution. We still have a huge opportunity. We have some interesting innovations coming up. We're getting better and better on our digital commerce. And I think the gum category will really rebound in the coming months, and that will be a boost to our growth there.As it relates to the consumer, the consumer is clearly -- the confidence is going up. But certainly, they are not yet to the bullishness that they had pre-pandemic. They're not cutting back on volumes, but they are clearly shopping around more, trying to find better deals, and they're also trading up and down as it relates to the pack size. We also see a shift to smaller stores because the quantity that they buy is smaller and they shop with more frequency.So I would say we are very encouraged by our China business. We have several fronts that allow us to grow. We've done that in the previous years. Those fronts have not been affected. And I believe that you will see some very good results coming from China in the second half of the year.Okay. Well, thank you with that. I think we can conclude the call for the second quarter. Thank you so much for assisting, and thank you for the confidence in the company.Luca ZaramellaThank you, everyone.OperatorThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.]"

Contreras said all brands had surpassed pre-pandemic levels, and some were now well ahead.The executives also cited a profit boost from more demand for cold drinks from thirsty customers in parts of Latin America and southern Europe struck by a heatwave.""We are seeing strong momentum in consumption,"" Contreras said, adding that he expects Alsea's brands to expand their market share.While the appreciation of Mexico's so-called ""super peso"" helped lessen Alsea's Euro-denominated debt, which accounts for a third of the total, the firm also suffered lower European earnings when converted to pesos.Alsea also passed its dollar-denominated bond to pesos, Contreras said, eliminating its dollar debt risk. Overall, the exchange rate shaved some 1.5 billion pesos off Alsea's debt, he said.Alsea's total debt shrunk to 45 billion pesos by the end of June.""With the foreign exchange we have right now, we can't do anything to have a better rate in terms of cost of debt,"" Contreras said on the call.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.39%.Factors to ConsiderVertex’s revenue growth in second-quarter 2023 is likely to have been driven by the rapid uptake of its blockbuster cystic fibrosis (“CF”) medicine Trikafta/Kaftrio (Trikafta’s brand name in Europe).This April, the FDA approved the expanded use of Trikafta in children with CF aged between two and five years. This label expansion is likely to have contributed to the drug’s sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Sales are also likely to have been driven by the drug’s strong uptake in international markets and increased drug adoption in the United States in the 6-11 age group. The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.17 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively.Higher Trikafta sales are likely to have caused sales erosion of Vertex’s other CF drugs and existing combinations, namely Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko/Symkevi.Investors will also expect an update on Vertex’s non-CF pipeline during first-quarter conference call.As part of its collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, Vertex developed exagamglogene autotemcel (“exa-cel”), an ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for two indications, namely sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (“TDT”).This June, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics announced that the FDA accepted the biologics license application (BLA) submissions seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications and a final decision is expected by Dec 8, 2023 and Mar 30, 2024, respectively. CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex have filed similar regulatory submissions for exa-cel in Europe, which were validated this January.Last month, Vertex presented positive data on all participants dosed in parts A and B of an ongoing phase I/II study evaluating VX-880 in T1D patients. All six patients treated with VX-880 produced endogenous insulin (C-peptide) and had improved glycemic control while reducing or eliminating insulin use. In fact, two study participants with at least one year follow-up met the criteria for the study’s primary endpoint. Based on these results, Vertex decided to advance the study to part C with concurrent dosing.Story continuesInvestors will also likely be on the lookout for pipeline updates on Vertex’s other pipeline candidates targeting acute pain, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe large-cap biotech’s performance has been impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Vertex has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.51%, on average.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote In the year so far, shares of Vertex have risen 21.9% against the industry’s 11.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Vertex this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Vertex has an Earnings ESP of -2.12% as the Most Accurate Estimate of $3.77 per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85.Zacks Rank: Vertex has a Zacks Rank #2, currently.

428,0f946baa-1ced-336a-a9ca-6ab05157165d,NSC,2023-07-28,NS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailment,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ns-works-move-past-803m-214639591.html,1690494399,STORY,['NSC'],"[Norfolk Southern posted second-quarter 2023 results Thursday morning. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Like the other Class I railroads reporting earnings this month, Norfolk Southern is looking to cut costs and increase productivity in the second half of 2023 to match anticipated market demand. But unlike the other railroads, NS is also contending with bringing both operating costs and rail service back to normal following the Feb. 3 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.Thirty-eight rail cars had derailed that Feburay evening and a fire ensued, damaging an additional 12 cars. No fatalities or injuries were reported, although there was a 1-mile evacuation zone due to the release of hazardous materials. Days after the derailment, NS and officials had decided to vent and burn the tank cars carrying vinyl chloride because of concerns that one of the cars could pose an explosion hazard.NS estimated that the derailment cost the railroad $416 million in the second quarter, with environmental cleanup activities driving much of that cost. Factoring in derailment-related costs from the first quarter, the derailment could cost NS upwards of $803 million.“The single biggest lever we’ve got right now is to absorb volume growth into our current cost structure,” CFO Mark George told investors during NS’ (NYSE: NSC) earnings call Thursday morning to discuss second-quarter 2023 results. “That is really going to provide a bit of peeling out from where we are today. And then I think at the same time … [NS is] working hard on productivity initiatives because … we’ve been growing a lot of costs and resources to accelerate the network.”Regarding the derailment, George noted that the railroad’s 2023 financial results so far don’t reflect potential recoveries from third parties nor any payments coming from insurance coverage. He said NS has started to pursue financial recovery from third parties and it will begin filing insurance claims in the third quarter.NS has been steadily working toward restoring train velocity, dwell and service across its network, as well as getting performance levels back to normal levels in the Midwest and Northeast, according to Paul Duncan, NS chief operating officer, who said to help out with that, the railroad has restored its double-track mainline service through East Palestine.Story continuesNow that performance levels are normalizing, NS hopes to work toward the goals it announced last December during its investor day. Those goals include bringing more reliability, productivity and resiliency into the network.“As the service product has stabilized, it gives us the opportunity to continue to iterate our plan and drive productivity and efficiencies into the base plan,” NS President and CEO Alan Shaw said during the earnings call. “So, it’s not just the elimination of the service recovery cost, we’re going to make the base plan better. And that’s exactly what we’re doing now, and that’s the structure that Paul has built into his organization.”When looking at head count for the second half of 2023, NS, like other Class I railroads, plans to slow down hiring efforts, focus on areas where there is still need for staffing and look to attrition to match resources with demand.“We are now at a point at which the training pipeline has crested and will begin to taper down over the back half of the year,” Duncan said. “We are committed to maintaining an appropriately sized workforce to drive reliability and long-term resilience as part of our strategy.”In terms of the outlook for different segments for the remainder of this year, NS sees opportunities in metals, construction and automotive volumes but continued weakness in chemicals, according to Ed Elkins, NS’ chief marketing officer. International intermodal volumes may continue to grow amid an anticipated rebound in import volumes, but domestic intermodal “will be dependent on the U.S. consumer, retail inventory levels and the truck market.”NS has adjusted its full-year revenue outlook to account for lower revenues in the first half of 2023, Shaw said.“We entered the year expecting to achieve revenues comparable to 2022. The first-half revenue shortfalls require us to modify our full-year outlook. We now anticipate revenue to be down at least 3% in 2023, implying some modest volume improvements in the back half,” Shaw said. “We’re also expecting modestly higher capital expenditures for the year as we accelerate investments in safety, service, productivity and growth.”Q2 2023 earnings resultsNS reported second-quarter net income of $356 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, compared with net income of $819 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2022.Revenues were down 8% year over year (y/y) to $2.98 billion for the second quarter, with revenue from NS’ intermodal segment falling 23% to $745 million. A 1% increase in international intermodal volume wasn’t enough to offset a 14% decrease in domestic intermodal volumes.Meanwhile, operating expenses were $2.4 billion for the second quarter, compared with $1.98 billion y/y. Expenses included the $416 million charge associated with the railroad’s ongoing response to the train derailment in East Palestine.Adjusting for the eastern Ohio incident charge, NS’ adjusted income from railway operations would be $992 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share would be $2.95. This constitutes declines of 22% and 14%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2022, NS said Thursday.If NS takes out the costs related to service disruptions, lost revenue and the $416 million in expense costs related to East Palestine, the railroad calculates its adjusted operating ratio would have been 66.7%, according to George, compared with the reported 80.7% for the second quarter. Investors sometimes use OR to determine the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health.OR for the second quarter of 2022 was 60.9%.“Our financial results were challenged this quarter as we noted in May that they would be. They reflect the decisive actions we have taken to advance our strategy and keep our promises in East Palestine. With every step forward, we are doing exactly what we said we would do when we announced our strategy last December [during NS’ investor day]. We are investing in the long-term success of our company,” Shaw said in prepared remarks on the earnings call. “With our strategy as our road map, we made significant progress in the second quarter, building the foundation for long-term value creation.”Train-the-trainer programIn a separate announcement Wednesday, NS said it and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) would be working on several initiatives to enhance the trainee program for conductors as well as increase compensation for conductors helping out with the training.“Ensuring that every conductor trainee receives proper training is the foundation of running a safe railroad,” Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, said in a news release. “These changes will deliver even greater quality and consistency for the Norfolk Southern conductor training program and ensure that every trainee will have a positive and comprehensive experience focused on safely performing their important work.”The initiatives include developing a train-the-trainer program, creating a standardized process to monitor and report progress and instituting a bilateral rating system to allow trainers and trainees to rate each other.NS is also increasing the pay for conductors who provide instruction to trainees and those conductors to decide to step away from work full-time and offer support and instruction as “craft mentors.”Said Shaw: “We have an obligation to make sure our newest employees — our conductor trainees — have the skills and knowledge to get the job done as safely as possible. We committed to partnering with our unions on safety, and our ongoing work with SMART-TD is another step in fulfilling that promise and investing in the future of our people.”The partnership comes as the Federal Railroad Administration placed a deadline on NS to have its conductor trainee certification program meet federal standards, according to news reports and SMART-TD.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:East Palestine expenses cut into Norfolk Southern’s Q2 net profitsOhio presses Biden for disaster relief for East PalestineWitness testifies freight car involved in NS train derailment was not inspectedNTSB examines communication gaps at East Palestine train derailment hearingColonial Terminals to expand breakbulk infrastructure in GeorgiaNorfolk Southern reaches sick leave agreements with 100% of craft workforceThe post NS works to move past $803M hit from Ohio derailment appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The below-par results naturally disappointed investors, resulting in the stock losing value in early trading.Quarterly earnings (excluding $1.39 from non-recurring items) of $2.95 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 and declined 14.49% year over year. Results were hurt by high costs.Railway operating revenues were $2,980 million in the quarter under review, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,071.8 million. The top line decreased 8.31% year over year, with all key segments including Merchandise, Intermodal and Coal registering deterioration in revenues. Total revenue per unit dipped 3% year over year. Income from railway operations decreased 55% to $576 million including a charge of $416 million associated with the Eastern Ohio incident.Railway operating expenses shot up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $2,404 million primarily due to double-digit increase in costs related to materials apart from the cost of Ohio derailment.Norfolk Southern’s operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated to 80.7% in the second quarter from 60.9% in the year-ago quarter due to higher costs.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Higher expenses and lower revenues ate away at Norfolk Southern’s net profits in the second quarter of 2023.The eastern U.S. Class I railroad reported net income of $356 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023, compared with net income of $819 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2022.Revenues were down 8% year over year (y/y) to $2.98 billion for the second quarter, with revenue from NS’ intermodal segment falling 23% to $745 million. A 1% increase in international intermodal volume wasn’t enough to offset a 14% decrease in domestic intermodal volumes.Meanwhile, operating expenses were $2.4 billion for the second quarter, compared with $1.98 billion y/y. Expenses include a $416 million charge associated with the railroad’s ongoing response to the Feb. 3 NS train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. NS noted that this charge does not reflect any potentially recoverable amounts under NS’ insurance policies or from any other third parties.Adjusting for the eastern Ohio incident charge, NS’ (NYSE: NSC) adjusted income from railway operations would be $992 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share would be $2.95. This constitutes declines of 22% and 14%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2022, NS said Thursday.“During the quarter, we delivered on our commitments to improve service, invest in safety and resiliency, and enhance the quality of life for our craft railroaders. Each of these are foundational to our strategy and position Norfolk Southern well for the future,” NS President and CEO Alan Shaw said in a release. “We are committed to our long-term strategy and are positioning our franchise to take on volume growth and deliver for our customers.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Ohio presses Biden for disaster relief for East PalestineStory continuesWitness testifies freight car involved in NS train derailment was not inspectedNTSB examines communication gaps at East Palestine train derailment hearingColonial Terminals to expand breakbulk infrastructure in GeorgiaNorfolk Southern reaches sick leave agreements with 100% of craft workforceThe post East Palestine expenses cut into Norfolk Southern’s Q2 net profits appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

434,f527be8c-37ca-3f7f-a029-61bdc54bba36,NSC,2023-07-28,Norfolk Southern says cost of fiery Ohio derailment doubles to $803 million as cleanup continues,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-says-cost-fiery-134913361.html,1690465753,STORY,['NSC'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The costs associated with Norfolk Southern's fiery February derailment in Ohio have more than doubled to $803 million as the railroad works to clean up the mess and moves forward with all the related lawsuits.Norfolk Southern recorded another $416 million charge related to the East Palestine derailment on Thursday as part of its second-quarter earnings after previously announcing a $387 million charge earlier this year. Most of the costs are related to the cleanup of the hazardous chemicals that were released, but $222 million is a combination of legal fees and the $63 million of assistance it has offered to the community.The derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border prompted a national reckoning on railroad safety after thousands of people had to evacuate when officials decided to blow open several tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they believed they might explode. The resulting fire sent a towering plume of black smoke over the town three days after the derailment that spilled several other hazardous chemicals when the tank cars carrying them ruptured.The $803 million cost estimate doesn't include funds to compensate the East Palestine community for any long-term health effects, drop in home values or drinking water issues because those are still being negotiated, so the total will grow. But Norfolk Southern also expects to eventually recover some of those costs from its insurance and lawsuits against other companies involved in the derailment.CEO Alan Shaw said he's “proud of the way our team rose to the challenge” after the derailment, and the railroad will continue to help the community around East Palestine recover while also improving general working conditions on the railroad to address' employees' quality of life concerns.“We are delivering on our commitment to recover service quickly,” Shaw said. “We’re delivering on our commitment to make a safe railroad even safer. We’re delivering on our commitment to address quality of life issues for our hard working craft railroaders. And we continue to deliver on our commitment to make things right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities.”Story continuesThe additional charges related to the derailment, combined with a 6% drop in the number of shipments the railroad delivered, more than halved the Atlanta-based company's profit to $356 million, or $1.56 per share. That's down from $819 million, or $3.45 per share, a year ago.Without the derailment costs, NS says it would have earned $2.95 per share in the quarter, still well below Wall Street expectations. The analysts surveyed by FactSet Research generally expected Norfolk Southern to report earnings per share of $3.11.Norfolk Southern's revenue declined to $2.98 billion in the quarter, which also disappointed. Analysts were expecting $3.08 billion revenue. Shaw said that full-year revenue is likely to be down at least 3% because of the volume concerns and tough pricing environment with fuel surcharges declining sharply. At the start of the year, the railroad had predicted revenue would be roughly flat this year.The railroad's traffic was hurt by the derailment because Norfolk Southern had to operate with only one of its two tracks by East Palestine running on a busy corridor. But consumer demand for imported goods has also weakened, and Norfolk Southern's main competitor in the east, CSX, has said it was able to pick up some of Norfolk Southern's business in the wake of the derailment.Shaw said Norfolk Southern's service has improved to levels rivaling its 2019 performance before the deep cuts it made during the pandemic once it reopened both rail lines through East Palestine. The railroad has also been hiring aggressively over the past year to give it enough crews and other workers to handle all the freight.The average speed of Norfolk Southern's trains reached 21.5 mph (34.60 kilometers per hour) this month on average, coming close to the 21.8 mph (35.08 kilometers per hour) it recorded before the derailment in January.Railroad executives expect they'll be able to regain some of their lost business as service continues to improve. But Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said there will continue to be pressure on Norfolk Southern's profits because of weak intermodal shipments, and the sharp decline in fuel surcharge and equipment storage fees the railroad had been charging.“There’s definitely some challenges to work through in the near term,” Windau said. And he said there will continue to be a spotlight on Norfolk Southern's efforts to improve safety in the wake of the Ohio derailment.Shaw said Norfolk Southern has the capacity to handle more shipments when the economy does recover, but with the mix of weaker and stronger demand across different sectors it's not clear when that will happen as companies continue to deal with inflation and rising interest rates.But the railroad's executives said the supply chain congestion that slowed shipments during the pandemic as they moved from overburdened ports over shorthanded railroads and trucks to reach their final destination is essentially gone. So the path is clear for shipments to increase eventually.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 36% to be precise, is private companies. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutions on the other hand have a 30% ownership in the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola Europacific Partners?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Coca-Cola Europacific Partners already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. The company's largest shareholder is COBEGA, S.A., with ownership of 36%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 19% and 2.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 2 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Coca-Cola Europacific PartnersWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own €34m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 36%, of the shares on issue. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 19% of the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable industries, you can go directly to 10 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market Cap.The most valuable companies in the world operate within various industries, including technology, energy, healthcare, financial services, and communication services. It is important to note that some of the technology and energy companies are listed as the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Many of these biggest companies have had to deal with a number of hurdles in the past few years, such as recessionary fears, overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, needs and demands of the employees, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine.In one of our previous articles, 25 largest energy companies by market cap, we discussed how the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly, causing oil prices to surge. However, according to an article published by CNBC on March 3, new data shows that the war in Ukraine has actually helped the US oil and gas industry as the US became one of the biggest energy-exporting countries. The US exported an average ten million barrels a day during the four-week period, which ended on February 24.In addition to the energy sector, the information technology industry also ranks among the biggest industries in the world. In fact, some of the most valuable companies in our list, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), all belong to the technology sector. Let's discuss what the future of  the technology industry looks like before we move on to the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.The Information Technology Sector on Track to Hit $12 Trillion By 2027Previously, the information technology industry had been subjected to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis. While the supply chain disruptions are back due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry is expected to continue growing in the long term. The information technology market was valued above $8.85 trillion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2023 through 2027, to reach a value of around $11.99 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe technology industry has become one of the biggest industries in the world and has also perhaps been the most consequential over the last couple of decades. In the modern day, technology has changed the way we live our lives and consumer demand for more technology continues to rise.As an obvious consequence, technology companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap. According to an article posted by Reuters on July 1, the market cap for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above the $3 trillion mark for the first time. This milestone follows the company’s launch of a mixed-reality headset.Moreover, the rising demand for tools powered by artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing services is expected to help boost the profits for technology companies. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appreciates the potential of both AI and cloud services as they offer their products and services, including Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing platform, to some of the biggest enterprises around the world. Here are some comments from the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call:“We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.”On February 8, Reuters had reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be rolling out an AI chatbot to operate alongside Bing's search results, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to challenge Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in search and browser technology.The AI war got ignited when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company we all know from ChatGPT.While Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google was previously at a disadvantage with regards to generative AI, but favorable demand trends for AI tools caused the company to take a big step forward. On May 12, Forbes reported that Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google had announced that their AI chatbot “Bard” is open to all and that the users will soon experience a completely new “search generation experience”.On July 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) posted market-beating earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $1.44 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.10. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $74.60 billion, up 7.06% year over year and ahead of Wall Street consensus by $1.85 billion.Now that we have discussed what's been happening in one of the most valuable industries in the world, let's take a look at some of the most valuable companies in the world, by market cap.50 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market CapCopyright: yuliufu / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this article, we will be looking at the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.

Now I'll turn the call over to James.Story continuesJames Quincey: Thanks, Robin, and good morning, everyone. After a strong start to the year, we continued our momentum in the second quarter. Our combination of strong love brands and an aligned pervasive distribution system is allowing us to win in many different operating environments. Given our strong first half results and the resilience of our business, we are raising both our top line and bottom line guidance today. To give you the full picture of our results and our raised guidance, I'll start by discussing second quarter performance and provide perspective on the current business and consumer environment. Then I'll highlight our performance across categories, including how we are driving quality leadership throughout our portfolio.Finally, I'll touch on why we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term objectives and then John will end by discussing our results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, competing macro forces were at play across our markets. On the positive side, many supply chain pressures eased, concerns surrounding the stability of the banking sector diminished, and energy prices continued to pull back from record highs. However, global inflation was still elevated and geopolitical tensions continued to exist in some markets. Despite this confluence of factors, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth in this quarter. Volume was flat and after a slower start, it sequentially improved, with June being our strongest month in the quarter.In the first half of 2023, we delivered volume growth that was consistent with our underlying performance since 2019. More broadly, our industry is strong and we believe we have significant headroom to grow both volume and value and we continue to gain share. During the quarter, we gained value share in both At-Home and Away-From-Home channels. As we look towards the second half, the global inflationary environment is impacting consumers and our business differently across geographies. In developed markets like North America and Western Europe, inflation is beginning to moderate and labor markets remain strong. Our elasticities continued to be relatively low. However, we have seen some willingness to switch to private label brands in certain categories.Across the sector, consumers are increasingly cost conscious. They're looking for value and stocking up on items on sale. In these markets, our pricing is largely in place and is expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. It's more important than ever to be consumer centric and to partner with customers to provide affordable and premium propositions which deliver value through basket and incidents growth. In many developing and emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, consumers are more accustomed to persistent inflation. However, the number of markets with intense inflation has expanded. Five of our top 40 markets are currently experiencing over 20% annual inflation. In these markets, it's equally important to leverage revenue growth management capabilities to balance affordability with premiumization to be able to take price with local market inflation, which helps offset the currency pressures.There are, as always, a few markets affected by specific local factors. In China, economic recovery slowed in the second quarter and inflation has declined. Consumer confidence is below pre-pandemic levels and we continue to monitor our leading consumer indicators and take action to win in the market. In India, business was unfavourably impacted by unseasonable rain and cooler temperatures in the quarter. However, the growth outlook remains intact. In a world with a wide spectrum of market dynamics, from inflation to currency devaluation to shifting consumer needs, our business is proving to be very resilient. We have many levers to pull to manage successfully through different operating environments, and we remain consumer centric and focused on growth.coca cola, drink, brandPixabay / Public DomainA Recipe for Success is unchanged. We continue to deliver on our strategy through a combination of world class marketing and innovation, excellence in revenue growth management and strong execution. We are raising the bar and increasing quality leadership across our portfolio. Starting with Coca-Cola. We are growing our base of Gen-Z drinkers, gaining share and leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies across our system. During the quarter, we gained volume and value share by linking Coca-Cola to consumption occasions and engaging consumers through local experiences. A great example is A Recipe for Magic, which was activated more than 50 markets and celebrates consuming Coca-Cola with meals. The campaign was supported by experiences using local chefs, leveraging approximately 750 influencers globally and was brought to life through social media and recipe focused billboards.The Coke and Meals campaign also allows Coca-Cola to strengthen its local relevance. For instance, in the Away-From-Home channel in Italy, Coca-Cola has grown incidence with Pizza, the number one consumed meal with approximately 3 billion pizzas each year from 10% to 20% over the past four years. While the Coca-Cola brand is ubiquitous, we tailor our price pack architecture to consumption occasions and are continuing to drive both affordability and premiumization. During the second quarter, we grew basket incidence and volume per trip by double-digits while increasing price per liter. Moving on to sparkling flavors. We are seeing strong engagement from consumers across our stapler brands, which includes Sprite, Fanta, Fresca and Thums Up. At the same time, we have significant headroom to drive further quality leadership across developed and developing markets.With Sprite, we are driving brand awareness by connecting consumers to passion points and personalized experience at a more granular and locally relevant levels through our global Heat Happens platform. In North America, Sprite celebrated Hip-Hop's 50th anniversary with the launch of Sprite Lymonade Legacy and sponsorship of concert tours, exclusive experiences and collaborations with prominent artists. We partnered with local pop stars and a Grammy producer in China using our global Sprite Limelight music program for Gen-Z drinkers across 1500 college locations. In South Korea, the Sprite Waterbomb Festival similarly generated strong results. In India, the Joke-in-a-Bottle promotion allowed consumers to scan packages and receive customized and localized jokes through WhatsApp to beat the heat.In June, Sprite was awarded Most Resilient Brand by Kantar for adding the greatest number of new households in 2022 of any FMCG brand. Turning to water, sports, coffee and tea. We are segmenting the broader opportunities and using our refreshed resource allocation capabilities to prioritize markets and subcategories that offer the highest return on our investment. We are building our edge through consumer centricity by accelerating the speed to market of our innovation, measuring results in real-time and scaling successes. We continue to build excitement for Fuze Tea through the rollout of Green Tea in Mexico. Some are limited edition in Turkey and expansion of Zero Sugar offerings across Europe. Early results show promising velocities and Fuze Tea grew volume double-digits during the quarter.Vitaminwater is another example. During the quarter, we relaunched Vitaminwater Zero in North America with a new sweetener system of Monk Fruit and Stevia, which generated value share gains. We are capitalizing on consumer needs for rapid hydration, a fast growing sub-segment within sports drinks with the launch of BODYARMOR Flash I.V. in the US and FlashLyte in Mexico. While still early, both saw strong consumer interest during the quarter and have demonstrated promising initial results. Juice value added dairy and plant-based beverages have delivered nine consecutive quarters of double-digit top line growth and gained both volume and value share during the quarter. We continue to innovate and drive premiumization under the Simply trademark, Simply Mixology, which provides consumers with great-tasting mixers and ready-to-drink mocktails.kicked off an experiential campaign that celebrated the start of the summer and its national rollout. Also, Fairlife had another exceptional quarter as both Core Power and Fairlife nutrition plan continued their strong momentum. In May, we announced a $650 million investment to build a state-of-the-art production facility to help drive the next wave of growth. Finally, we are encouraged by what we are seeing across alcohol ready-to-drink beverages. We continue to take a measured approach through exploring and applying our learnings. While it's still early, Jack and Coke has shown promising results. In the Philippines, the combination of Jack and Coke and Lemon-dou delivered strong share gains. The Schweppes Mojito rollout in India is also off to a good start.And these examples illustrate how our marketing transformation is coming to life. The strength of our total beverage portfolio gives us further confidence that we can continue to deliver by providing consumers beverage choices for every occasion. Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference. And we remain committed to building a more sustainable future for our company and the planet as we strive to grow our business. We continue to pursue progress toward our vision of a circular economy for packaging through innovation and partnerships. For example, in the US, we recently partnered with Republic Services to ensure we have an adequate supply of recycled plastic for our packaging. At the same time, we are embracing refillables. We recently kicked off a program with customers in four US cities to test refillable fountain cups with plans to expand elsewhere.We've successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world.With that, I'll turn the call over to you, John.John Murphy: Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the momentum of our business and our strong second quarter results. Starting with the top line, we grew organic revenues 11%. Unit cases were flat. As James said, volume for the second quarter got off to a slower start, but ended on a positive note. Concentrate sales were one point ahead of unit cases for the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of concentrate shipments. Price mix growth was 10% for the quarter, driven by carryover pricing coming into the base from last year, along with some new pricing actions across operating segments, including the impact of hyperinflationary markets. Comparable gross margin for the quarter was up approximately 40 basis points, driven by underlying expansion and a slight benefit from bottler refranchising partially offset by the impact of currency.Comparable operating margin expanded approximately 90 basis points for the quarter. This was primarily driven by strong top line growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. Partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds. Putting it all together, second quarter comparable EPS of $0.78 was up 11% year-over-year despite higher than expected 6% currency headwinds. Free cash flow was approximately $4 billion year-to-date. This was largely attributable to strong underlying operational performance and working capital benefits, partially offset by a $720 million transition tax payment that was made during the second quarter as well as M&amp;A related payments.Our balance sheet is strong and our net debt leverage of 1.6 times EBITDA is below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same and we continue to invest to drive long-term growth. As James mentioned, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in the marketplace. While we continue to spend our strategic flywheel faster to generate top line led growth, we've also progressed on a margin agenda, as demonstrated by our consistent track record of offsetting cost headwinds to sustain steady gross margins. We have numerous levers available to drive top line growth and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our spend over the long-term. Our all-weather strategy, coupled with the great plans that we have in place to continue to create quality leadership across our portfolio give us good visibility to deliver on our raised 2023 guidance.This is comprised of organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, which includes positive volume growth while continuing to be led by price mix. There are a few considerations to keep in mind. We expect pricing in developed markets to moderate through the year as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year. In developing and emerging markets, we aim to take price with local market inflation. To the extent that intense inflationary markets drive elevated price mix. The impact is oftentimes offset by currency, as it is frequently difficult to hedge our exposure. Due to our reporting calendar, there will be one additional day in the fourth quarter. We now expect comparable currency neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11%. Based on current rates and our hedge positions, we are updating our currency outlook of an approximate 3 to 4 point headwind to comparable net revenues and an approximate 4 to 5 point currency headwind to comparable earnings per share for full year 2023.Inflationary pressures are beginning to moderate in some ways, including freight rates that are favorable compared to last year. That said, several commodities that are prevalent in our basket like sugar and juice remain elevated and we have some hedges that we will be rolling off to less favorable rates. Based on current rates and hedge positions, we continue to expect per case commodity price inflation in the range of a mid-single digit impact on comparable cost of goods sold in 2023. Our updated underlying effective tax rate for 2023 is now 19.3%. All-in, we are updating comparable earnings per share growth of 5% to 6% versus $2.48 in 2022. We continue to expect to generate approximately $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 through approximately $11.4 billion in cash from operations less approximately $1.9 billion in capital investments.If you exclude the transition tax payment made in the second quarter and various payments associated with M&amp;A transactions, our implied free cash flow conversion would be within our long-term guidance. This guidance does not include any payments related to our ongoing US income tax dispute with the IRS. As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to build a culture that emphasizes raising the bar in every aspect of how we do business. Thanks to the tremendous ongoing commitment of our system employees around the world, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2023 and drive value for our stakeholders over the long-term. With that operator, we are ready to take questions.See also Top 50 Countries with the Most Beautiful Women in the World and 30 Best Excuses to Get Out of Work Provided By AI Chatbots.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE: MHK) today announced second quarter 2023 net earnings of $101 million and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.58. Adjusted net earnings were $176 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.76, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. Net sales for the second quarter of 2023 were $3.0 billion, a decrease of 6.4% as reported and 9.6% on a legacy and constant currency and days basis versus the prior year. For the second quarter of 2022, net sales were $3.2 billion, net earnings were $280 million and EPS was $4.40. Adjusted net earnings were $281 million, and adjusted EPS was $4.41, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.For the six-month period ending July 1, 2023, net earnings and EPS were $181 million and $2.84, respectively. Adjusted net earnings were $288 million, and adjusted EPS was $4.51, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges. For the first six months of 2023, net sales were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 6.7% as reported and 9.0% on a legacy and constant currency and days basis versus the prior year. For the six-month period ending July 2, 2022, net sales were $6.2 billion, net earnings were $526 million and EPS was $8.17; adjusted net earnings were $527 million, and adjusted EPS was $8.18, excluding restructuring, acquisition and other charges.Commenting on Mohawk Industries’ second quarter performance, Jeffrey S. Lorberbaum, Chairman and CEO, stated, “Our margins across the enterprise expanded sequentially due to seasonal improvements, increased production, productivity initiatives and lower input costs. We generated $147 million of free cash flow during the quarter, further strengthening our financial position.Typical of housing recessions, higher interest rates and inflation are significantly impacting flooring sales around the world. To manage, we are selectively investing to increase sales and reducing expenses by enhancing productivity, consolidating distribution points and improving administrative efficiencies. In the quarter, we initiated restructuring and integration actions that should save $35 million annually at a total cost of approximately $17 million. We anticipate half of the estimated savings should be realized in the current year, partially offsetting weak residential remodeling activity. In addition, we are limiting future capital investments to those delivering significant sales, margin and operational improvements. In all our regions, we are taking actions to increase sales, including promotions, retailer incentives and selective product launches. The integration of our recent acquisitions is progressing as we combine strategies and enhance their manufacturing and product offering.Story continuesAcross our regions, we continue to see stronger results in the commercial sector than in residential. Residential remodeling remains the industry's greatest headwind due to lower home sales and deferred home improvement projects. We believe channel inventories have declined and could be at a bottom. Price competition is increasing with declining industry volume, mix and input costs. In the U.S., the housing market remains under pressure due to limited supply, high interest rates and continued inflation. Existing homeowners are not moving at historical levels to maintain their low mortgage rates. In the second quarter, new U.S. home starts increased to an annual rate of 1.45 million, the first quarterly increase since the beginning of last year. We believe the trend in housing starts will continue and will positively impact flooring shipments in the future. In our other regions, home sales and remodeling are also declining due to inflation and interest rates. In Europe, energy prices have continued to decline, though persistent inflation in other categories is limiting consumer remodeling investments. In the quarter, we benefited from the lower energy prices that flowed through our P&amp;L. Our investments in biomass, solar and wind energy production reduce our operational expenses and carbon footprint, positively impacting our performance. The Italian government provided energy subsidies at a reduced level, and the program will not be continued. While managing lower market demand, we are preparing for the rebound that historically follows cyclical declines in our industry. Our porcelain slab, insulation, premium laminate, LVT and quartz countertop manufacturing expansions should deliver the greatest growth as the markets recover.For the second quarter, the Global Ceramic Segment reported a 0.3% decline in net sales as reported, or a 6.7% decline on a legacy and constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 7.3% as reported, or 8.6% on an adjusted basis, as a result of higher inflation, lower volumes and temporary shutdowns, partially offset by productivity gains and favorable pricing and product mix. Our U.S. ceramic business benefited from a greater participation in the commercial and new construction channels, enhanced designs and more consistent service. We are introducing higher styled products to improve our mix and are focusing on stronger sales channels. We have expanded our customer base, which is helping to offset the weakness in residential remodeling. In our European ceramic business, volumes in the quarter improved sequentially, and our results benefited from sales of premium residential collections, commercial products and exports. We are adjusting to the changing environment and using promotional activities to deliver additional sales volume. As the integration of our acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico proceed, we are realigning the organizations, defining new sales and product strategies and executing cost reductions. The synergies we are realizing are partially offsetting the weakening market conditions, and we have begun to leverage sales of our total product portfolio to expand our distribution.During the second quarter, our Flooring Rest of the World Segment’s net sales decreased by 11.4% as reported or 10.2% on a legacy and constant currency and days basis. The Segment’s operating margin was 11.0% as reported, or 12.1% on an adjusted basis, as a result of lower volumes, transactional foreign exchange headwinds and temporary shutdowns, partially offset by productivity gains. The Segment continues to successfully manage a difficult environment. Consumer spending has not improved as we expected, with confidence remaining low given inflation, higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though our flooring sales are under pressure, our sheet vinyl collections are outperforming as consumers trade down to lower-priced alternatives. We are aligning laminate and LVT production with present demand and introducing new products, merchandising and specific promotions to expand sales volumes. We have begun to transition our residential LVT offering from flexible to rigid cores and are executing the previously announced restructuring to support this conversion. In panels, fewer projects are being initiated and industrial use has decreased due to slower market conditions. While long-term prospects for our insulation business remain strong, demand is presently declining as residential and commercial investments are being deferred. The Australia and New Zealand housing markets have softened, and we are introducing new products and selective promotions to increase sales volume.In the second quarter, our Flooring North America Segment sales declined 8.9% as reported or 12.1% on a legacy basis. The Segment's operating margin was 3.7% as reported, or 6.0% on an adjusted basis, as a result of unfavorable pricing and product mix along with reduced volumes and temporary shutdowns, partially offset by lower inflation. The Segment’s second quarter margins sequentially expanded due to seasonality and lower costs flowing through inventory. To control costs, we have enhanced productivity, streamlined administrative functions and initiated restructuring actions. To increase sales, we are initiating selective promotional activity, enhancing our product offering and introducing more consumer-friendly displays. The U.S. commercial sector has proven more resilient as businesses continue to invest in new construction and remodeling projects, though we are experiencing some mix pressure as customers seek to maintain budgets. The July Architectural Billing Index reflected a stable environment for new projects. We continue to see a broader adoption of our waterproof RevWood products in both the retail and builder channels. We have increased the offering of our revolutionary Signature Technology, which accentuates the richness of our Pergo and Karastan laminate collections. We have enhanced our luxury Karastan and Godfrey Hirst residential carpet collections and are providing retailer incentives to grow volumes. Our expanded solution-dyed polyester carpet portfolio is increasing our position with multifamily developers and single home builders, negatively impacting our product mix. We have integrated our recent non-woven acquisition and are improving its sales and operations. Our new rigid LVT introductions with updated visuals, WetProtect and antimicrobial technologies differentiated us in the market, and our sheet vinyl sales rose as consumers selected more affordable options.Mohawk’s second quarter performance reflected the positive impact of many initiatives we are executing across our business. We are managing the current market conditions while preparing for the rebound in demand that follows cyclical downturns. Central banks have raised interest rates to reduce inflation and are signaling that additional rate hikes are possible. In the U.S., we have seen a rise in builder confidence and housing starts that will increase our residential new construction business. We expect the commercial sector to outperform the residential channel through this year, even with continued weakness in the office category. Though employment remains strong, remodeling and existing home sales are being delayed due to limited housing availability, higher interest rates and inflation. Historically, when the economy recovers, these postponed remodeling projects fuel greater industry growth. Our new restructuring initiatives should save $35 million per year, and our recent acquisitions will add greater benefit to our results as we optimize their performance. In this competitive market, we expect continued pressure on pricing and mix, partially offset by the flow through of lower material and energy costs. Our third quarter seasonally weakens due to summer holidays, lower consumer spending and lower production in Europe. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.62 to $2.72, excluding any restructuring, acquisition and other charges.At Mohawk, we are taking the necessary steps to manage today's challenges while preparing for tomorrow's opportunities. When central banks shift their focus to a more balanced approach, our business will accelerate as the industry recovers. In all our regions, housing is in short supply, aging homes are in need of remodeling and businesses will invest to grow in more favorable conditions. These factors will create higher growth for flooring, and our investments in capacity expansions and our recent acquisitions will further enhance our results.”ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIESMohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world.

with certain non-GAAP financial measures. As required by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the tables above present a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to the comparable US GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures, when reconciled to the corresponding US GAAP measure, help its investors as follows: Non-GAAP revenue measures that assist in identifying growth trends and in comparisons of revenue with prior and future periods and non-GAAP profitability measures that assist in understanding the long-term profitability trends of the Company's business and in comparisons of its profits with prior and future periods.The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP revenue measures because these items can vary dramatically between periods and can obscure underlying business trends. Items excluded from the Company’s non-GAAP revenue measures include: foreign currency transactions and translation; more or fewer shipping days in a period and the impact of acquisitions.The Company excludes certain items from its non-GAAP profitability measures because these items may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company's core operating performance. Items excluded from the Company's non-GAAP profitability measures include: restructuring, acquisition and integration-related and other costs, legal settlements, reserves and fees, net of insurance proceeds, impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, acquisition purchase accounting, including inventory step-up from purchase accounting, release of indemnification assets and the reversal of uncertain tax positions.Contact:James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer (706) 624-2239]"
448,74b3aaf1-adeb-399c-90b2-1259fd5f61bb,INCY,2023-07-28,Incyte (INCY) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-incy-report-q2-earnings-142000419.html,1690467600,STORY,"['INCY', 'NVS']","[Incyte Corporation INCY is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, before market open.The company's earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 10.05%. In the last reported quarter, Incyte’s earnings missed estimates by 56.47%.Shares of the company have lost 21.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry's 11.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet's see how things might have shaped up for the quarter to be reported.Factors to ConsiderIncyte primarily derives product revenues from sales of its lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), in the United States, and its other marketed drugs.Increase in sales of Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor in all approved indications (polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis and refractory acute graft-versus-host disease [GvHD]), is likely to have boosted revenues in the second quarter. Sales increased 7% year over year in the first quarter. This trend might have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Jakafi's sales is pinned at $648.44 million.The company also earns product royalty revenues from Novartis AG NVS for the commercialization of Jakafi in non-U.S. markets. Novartis licensed ruxolitinib for its development and commercialization outside the United States.While Incyte markets Jakafi in the United States, Novartis promotes the same drug as Jakavi outside the country. INCY is expected to have received higher royalties from NVS in the second quarter on higher Jakavi sales. For the second quarter, Novartis reported a strong performance by Jakavi. The drug generated sales of $435 million on constant currency basis.Incyte also receives royalties from the sales of Tabrecta (capmatinib), which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Novartis has exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to Tabrecta.Story continuesWhile Jakafi’s sales and royalties are the key catalysts for INCY’s revenue growth, Iclusig’s sales and Olumiant’s royalties from Eli Lilly are likely to have contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Iclusig’s product revenues and Olumiant’s royalties is pegged at $26.53 million and $36.83 million, respectively.Incremental sales from newly approved drugs like Opzelura and Zynyz are expected to have boosted sales. The adoption of other newly approved drugs like Monjuvi and Pemazyre is also likely to have bolstered the company’s top-line performance.Total costs and expenses increased year over year in the first quarter. This trend is expected to have continued in the second quarter owing to a rise in research and development expenses, selling, and general and administrative costs.Recent Key DevelopmentsIn July, the company announced positive top-line results from the late-stage TRuE-AD3 study on Opzelura (ruxolitinib cream).The study successfully met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that a significantly higher number of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved Investigator's Global Assessment Treatment Success compared to those treated with a non-medicated cream.The positive results from the TRuE-AD3 study highlight the potential of ruxolitinib cream in providing an effective non-steroidal topical therapy for children suffering from atopic dermatitis.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Incyte this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Incyte has an Earnings ESP of -6.51% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 82 cents per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Incyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Its earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark in the other two, delivering an average negative surprise of 2.75%.

This compares to earnings of $1.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 52.38%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Weyerhaeuser shares have added about 10.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Weyerhaeuser?While Weyerhaeuser has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Weyerhaeuser: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock.

Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another successful quarter by focusing on our mission as a critical infrastructure operator. The quarter included the renewal of the .net registry agreement and solid financial results. Additionally, last week, we marked 26 years of 100% availability in the .com, .net domain name resolution system. Throughout the various global challenges over the past 26 years, from the pandemic to natural disasters to evolving cyber threats, our purpose-built network has kept billions of people worldwide continuously connected to what matters most. The work we do to operate, protect and evolve key Internet infrastructure has never been more important than it is today. Reaching this mark is a testament to the ongoing investments made in our platforms, processes and people.On June 30, we announced the renewal of the .net registry agreement with ICANN, as expected, given the presumptive right of renewal in our agreement. The business terms of the agreement such as pricing, the fees paid to ICANN, our renewal rights and the 6-year term of the agreement are unchanged. The next renewal for the .net registry agreement will be June of 2029.In addition to delivering on our mission during the second quarter, I'm pleased with the financial results, which showed the continued strength of our business during this uncertain macroeconomic period. For the second quarter, revenues grew 5.7% year-over-year while EPS grew 16.2% year-over-year. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 174.4 million domain names, up from 174.3 million in Q2 2022 and up from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the second quarter, the domain name base decreased by 0.3 million domain names, offsetting some of the 1 million names we added during the first quarter.From a new registration perspective, the second quarter delivered a 1.5% year-over-year increase with 10.2 million new registrations compared to 10.1 million last year. We believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2023 will be approximately 73.4% compared to 73.8% a year ago. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, the core value proposition for domain names remain strong, and we're seeing broad-based engagement from our registrar channel.However, with these fundamentals intact, low demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth. With this current trend, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 0% and 1% for the full year of 2023. This updated range reflects continued uncertainty, especially the weakness we continue to see related to China. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $936 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $220 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of VeriSign common stock by $1.14 billion to a total of $1.5 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.On .web, as many of you have seen from our statement on May 3, ICANN's Board of Directors dismissed Afilias' objections regarding the .web auction and directed that NDC's .web application move forward. This was a significant finding by the Board, and we're pleased that our role in the auction was proved to be consistent with ICANN's policies. Subsequently, according to ICANN's website, Afilias has filed another IRP complaint, presumably challenging the Board's decision. This filing has not been posted nor has any response from ICANN. ICANN has placed NDC's .web application on hold now. Given the Board's decision, we see no basis for any further delay in delegating .web, but this is an ICANN process, and we're not yet involved in it.Finally, as announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.99 for the annual wholesale price for .net domain names, which will raise the price from $9.92 to $10.91 effective February 1, 2024.And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George?George E. KilgussThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company generated revenue of $372 million, up 5.7% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $249 million, an increase of 5.4% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the second quarter totaled $123 million compared to $123 million last quarter and $116 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $186 million compared to $167 million a year earlier which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.79 for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.54 for the same quarter of 2022.Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2023 was $145 million and free cash flow was $139 million, both of which were at similar levels in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the 6-month period ended June 30 totaled $404 million and $392 million and were up from $352 million and $339 million, respectively, for the same 6-month period a year ago.I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.500 billion. This updated revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base growth rate will be between 0% and 1%, as Jim mentioned. Operating income is still expected to be between $990 million and $1.05 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is now expected to be an expense of between $30 million to $40 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million to $55 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%.In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2023, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission and our objectives throughout the year.Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.D. James BidzosThank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, managed our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and focus.Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird.Robert Cooney OliverJim, my first question is for you. I've got 3 questions total. But first is for you, and it's on .com. I think we all can kind of see real-time some of the sluggishness in the market. And it looks like really domain activity in .com has not kind of come back to sort of prepandemic levels maybe as you guys had hoped. I know in your prepared remarks, and appreciate the commentary relative to China, but would just love to hear a little bit more about your view there on what's happening, whether it be China or if there are other factors? And I know Janet Yellen was just over in China, called for stimulus, sounds like there's some coming. So I just would also love to hear what you think gets us out of this rut.D. James BidzosI wish I knew the answer to that, but let me do my best. I'm happy to share what I can. Well, first, there's the obvious macro factors affecting the economy and extended COVID recovery declining but still high inflation rates, geopolitics and the growth rate of new business starts, which while still improving, are still off their highs. As far as specific factors for our business, I don't know how to put it, Rob, there's China. It's the largest single factor and it continues to remain soft in both new registrations and renewal rates. Stringent registration rules and a challenging COVID recovery seem to be the main factors there.In the U.S., channel focus is a factor. As we've seen before, some channel partners shift their focus to ARPU rather than new customer acquisition in times of slower economic activity. That is cyclical. At some point, they -- you got to acquire new customers. And so they'll return to that. Our revised guidance recognizes the uncertainty that all these factors represent for the remainder of 2023.I'll just add and as far as things we can control, these include meeting our contractual requirements, obviously, but practicing responsible expense management and focusing on our capital allocation strategy. Continuing to focus on those areas that we can control, that's the key for us to deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. So hopes that's helpful.Robert Cooney OliverVery helpful, yes. And I also appreciate that you went into some detail in your prepared remarks on .web. And I think just stepping back now, it's been a 6-, almost 7-year journey now. And I think investors are confused by the landscape and what's going on. And it's very hard to know whether this sort of resets us back to the beginning of the process with the IRP or whether this is now a next step in the process which would circumvent the need to do that. If you could help us perhaps provide a little bit more color as to how you view that currently to the extent that you can.D. James BidzosHappy to do that. I keep a couple of notes here handy, just for that purpose. Let me -- well, first of all, it's easy to get confused. I completely understand that. There's a lot of -- we talk about this every quarter, and there are a lot of terms that we use, acronyms like IRP and CEP that even experienced lawyers wouldn't be familiar with if they didn't operate in the ICANN world. So maybe I can simplify with a little bit of background what's happened. Maybe even define some of these terms.So first, when we talk about an IRP, independent review panel, that's a lawsuit, not in court, but more like an arbitration demand that someone can bring against ICANN. However, the only claims allowed are those based on a violation by ICANN of its bylaws. A CEP, you've heard us use that, or cooperative engagement process, is a discussion between a potential IRP filer and ICANN ahead of an IRP. And all actions associated with the issue behind the IRP are automatically put on hold during the CEP, and that's kind of what we've been in for the last few weeks.You've also heard another acronym, NDC, that's -- that stands for Nu Dot Co, and that's a company that VeriSign entered into an agreement with about .web.So let me try to simplify just how we got here. I don't want to speculate about what's going to happen going forward, not just because it's pending litigation, but much of it is ICANN process that's not ours. But let me just give you a really brief history now that some of the terms are easier to understand with .web.So in 2016, there was an auction for .web. NDC won that auction with our backing. In 2018, a company called Afilias, the plaintiff, filed an IRP seeking to have the IRP panel disqualify NDC and to award .web to them because Afilias objected to the auction and to our, VeriSign's, participation with NDC. A few years later in 2021 after a lengthy legally maneuverings, the IRP panel said, no. The panel said, ICANN owns the issue and the panel tells ICANN to go review and decide the issue. But Afilias doesn't like that answer and files a follow-up motion asking the panel essentially for a do-over. And the panel once again tells Afilias, no. But this time, they call Afilias' request frivolous and they sanction Afilias, ordering Afilias to pay ICANN's attorney fees.During 2022 and early '23, ICANN then followed the panel's recommendation. They undertook a thorough 16-month review process. In early May of this year, ICANN announced that it had completed its review and had concluded, by a Board vote that was without objection, that Afilias' accusations were wrong and the Board -- and then the Board directed ICANN's staff to proceed with processing NDC's .web application. Afilias then filed the CEP, which then automatically paused the processing of .web.So now Afilias has filed another IRP, that's true. But this time, there's something new and substantial. There's the definitive and affirmative ruling from the ICANN Board of Directors, again, without objection, a vote that .web should be awarded to NDC, a vote resulting from a 16-month process that included work by ICANN's staff who reviewed new submissions by VeriSign and Afilias, working with their law firms, who were allowed to use and even supplement the entire legal record from the earlier 2-year IRP, a vote that resulted in a finding that .web should be awarded to NDC. So that's new, and that's not trivial. We believe that Afilias has been and is still litigating for delay.Now in terms of next steps, we'll have to see whether ICANN continues with the hold on .web, the .web delegation or not during the IRP. ICANN could continue processing the .web PLD during the IRP, although that decision could be challenged. We don't believe there should be any further delay, but this is ICANN's process, and we will continue to work within that system.So what happens next? I don't want to comment on, as I said, it's pending litigation, but I hope that bit of background and history was helpful.Robert Cooney OliverYes, it's really helpful. I appreciate that summary, Jim and I'm glad it's on the transcript because I know for one, I'm going to need to look back at that, although I've looked at a lot of it...D. James BidzosYes, there's a lot there, but -- yes.Robert Cooney OliverYes, really. You even have me will through a lot of it. I really appreciate it. I know -- and I'm not the only one anymore, so I'll squeeze in one last question, and that is just on .net. I just wanted to ask, so it's second year in a row where you guys are availing yourself of the opportunity to raise price on .net. And that's coming off for a long period where you did not. What's changed for you guys relative to your view to take price now on .net? What, if anything, in terms of your mindset, mentality has changed there and -- relative to .net pricing?George E. KilgussYes. Thanks, Rob. This is George. I mean if you look back at .net, I mean, we had not taken a price increase for quite a period of time. I think the last price increase we took was in 2018. And obviously, we announced and just took one here in February to $9.92. So as we think about .net, we'll look at the industry, we'll look at where it's positioned within the marketplace and we think the price that we're raising it to that we just announced is keeping .net competitive with the other TLDs within the -- which it competes with.OperatorWe will take our last question from the line of Ygal Arounian with Citigroup.Ygal ArounianI want to come back to the overall growth in domains. Two parts on that. First, I wanted dig to into the comment about China being the kind of biggest piece of this, and China is a much smaller part of your overall revenue base. So I just want to understand like how it's driving that impact. So are you saying that domain growth in the U.S. is relatively healthy? Is there any color you can give to what the growth in the U.S. and other regions might be? So what ex-China looks like?And then the comment on the channel focus and the channel focusing on ARPU versus net adds, that was really interesting. Can you help -- can you just elaborate on that point a little bit? Like how responsible are the channel partners for driving the growth? Is it their marketing and the push for domain registration? Like what is their role and how much of an impact can they have in spurring up demand?George E. KilgussYes. Sure, Ygal. This is George. So your first question was from kind of a domain name base perspective. We have seen growth here in Q2. I would say the regions that we report out on the U.S., EMEA and our all other segments from a year-over-year domain name base have all been growing. But China, we've seen that domain name base segment decline.I think if you want to get some relative terms, you probably can look in our 10-Q that's filed this afternoon and look at the revenue growth rates of those segments. You'll see that China in the quarter was down about 10%, EMEA was up about 1% and the U.S. was up about 7% and all of the category was up about 15%, and that really comprised -- the weighted average of that comprised 5.7%. So we're still seeing growth.As far as new units, I would say China, again, is down. The U.S. was relatively flat here in the second quarter from a new unit perspective. But the other markets that we report on were up. So still seeing some growth here in the market, but China has really been, as Jim mentioned, a drag on new unit growth here and a little bit on revenue growth as well.D. James BidzosYes, Ygal, Jim. Your question about ARPU, let me just say one thing upfront, you can clarify the question after this, if you want, but I just want to say that we -- I think you know, but we have sort of limited visibility into the end user, obviously, sell only through registrars. So I think the point is, is that ARPU is a sort of phenomenon. It's typical of any business. In certain economic conditions, it becomes more efficient for them to focus on ARPU rather than customer acquisition as the cost of those activities vary and the results are different and more advantageous in certain economic conditions. So the observation is based on a phenomenon that affects our channel just like everybody else, not on anything that's particularly unique that we see or understand about it.And we can just observe this behavior, obviously, through our own registrations and monitoring their websites and looking at how they bundle their products. But this is something that every business does, not unique to registries, registrars or the DNS, just to clarify.So there's a limit to what -- I mean there's not a great insight there that -- it's just an observation, a factual observation based on what we see and observe. And it tends to be cyclical. We see that, obviously, they go through cycles, you focus on ARPU for a while and then you go back into new customer acquisition. So we see that -- I think it was in 2014, we had a very visible cycle of this that we went through.Ygal ArounianS Okay. I'm asking because I think it was really interesting comment and just kind of tie from what we've seen from those channel partners like some of the key [levers you've] talked about, marketing efficiencies and to pull back materially on the marketing spend. And then we also saw some consolidation within the space on the (inaudible) space. So I'm not sure if what you think about that, if that has an impact to it, likely tying it to the marketing expenses.D. James BidzosI had some difficulty hearing the last part of that. Marketing spend certainly is another factor in various economic circumstances. Obviously, any retailers are going to vary their marketing spend, and that has an effect on us. And obviously, during the pandemic and recently, we've seen some of that behavior that affected registrations as well. If I missed anything in the last part of your question, I apologize, please ask again. The line is a bit fuzzy.Ygal ArounianNo, that's it. I think you've got the question. It's really helpful and really interesting. I mean I haven't thought about it that way, so interesting to hear.D. James BidzosOkay. Great. I was glad it was helpful.David AtchleyGreat. Thanks, Ygal.OperatorThis concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to David Atchley for final comments.David AtchleyThank you, operator.

Price and EPS SurpriseIngersoll Rand Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIngersoll Rand Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ingersoll Rand Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteSolid underlying demand and higher orders are likely to have driven Ingersoll Rand’s second-quarter performance.Higher orders across the product portfolio of compressors and power tools and lifting are expected to have aided the Industrial Technologies &amp; Services unit in the to-be-reported quarter. Contribution from the January 2023 acquisition of SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business is also expected to have boosted the unit’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect the segment’s revenues to increase 11.4% from the year-ago reported number. We expect the segment’s adjusted EBITDA to increase 9.3% from the year-ago reported figure.The Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment is expected to reflect benefits from last October’s acquisition of Dosatron International, which has expanded Ingersoll Rand’s digital technology portfolio. Pricing actions are also expected to have supported the segment’s growth. Our estimate for the segment’s revenues indicates a 3.1% increase from second-quarter 2022 reported figure. Our estimate for the segment’s adjusted EBITDA suggests a 14.5% rise from second-quarter 2022 reported figure.However, high raw material costs due to inflationary pressure might have hurt IR’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, foreign currency headwinds are likely to have dented its top-line performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model suggests an earnings beat for Ingersoll Rand this time around.

464,7c50d73a-e01a-3179-840c-d3ecc688503b,VMC,2023-07-28,Mexico's president offers to buy US company's coastal property for $375 million to end dispute,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexicos-president-offers-buy-us-192353728.html,1690485833,STORY,['VMC'],"[MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Thursday that he has offered to buy an American company’s Caribbean coast property for about $385 million to end a bitter, years-long dispute.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said a formal offer would be presented to Alabama-based Vulcan Materials. The company operated gravel extraction pits at the Yucatan peninsula site before López Obrador's administration closed them.The company said it had not yet received the president's proposal or responded to the idea. In papers filed for a case before an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion.López Obrador said his much lower offer was fair and based on a government assessment. He said the most attractive part of the property was the freight shipping dock, which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships.As the only significant port facility on that stretch of the Caribbean coast, the dock would also be useful for transporting gravel and cement for the president's massive train construction project, known as the Maya Train.López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded gravel pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an ""ecotourism"" area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator.The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico.López Obrador left open a vague threat of seizing the property if the offer wasn't accepted by the time he leaves office in September 2024.“Before I leave (office), this is going to be resolved, one way or another,” he said, adding that the company would have to agree to drop its damages-seeking cases before the arbitration panel as part of the deal.In 2021, Mexico's environment ministry closed Vulcan’s limestone quarry and forbade the company from exporting stone that was long used in U.S. and Mexican building projects. The president accused the company of extracting rock and exporting it without proper permits. Vulcan said it had the needed permits.Story continuesIn March, the U.S. State Department said it was “concerned about the fair treatment of our companies in Mexico” after Mexican police seized the cargo terminal on Vulcan's property.Police held the port and used it to unload cargo from a Mexican cement and aggregates company, Cemex.The president has publicly sparred with Vulcan for over a year. The dock at Punta Venado would allow cement, crushed stone and other materials to complete the Maya Train project to reach the area. Because there aren’t any local supplies of crushed stone needed to stabilize the tracks, López Obrador has been forced to import the stone, known as ballast, from Cuba.Ships carrying the Cuban ballast have had to dock at the port of Sisal, on the Gulf of Mexico side of the Yucatan peninsula, and have their cargo trucked about 180 miles (300 kilometers) to some train construction sites.The only private freight dock on the Caribbean side that could handle the Cuban shipments, and other shipments of cement and steel, is the one owned by Vulcan.The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites.López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train.]"

This compares to earnings of $2.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of gypsum wallboard and cement would post earnings of $2.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.79, delivering a surprise of 18.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Eagle Materials , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $601.52 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.61%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $561.39 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Eagle Materials shares have added about 42.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Eagle Materials?While Eagle Materials has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Eagle Materials: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.08 on $619.97 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.56 on $2.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates is currently in the top 6% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer, commented: ""Non-GAAP operating income more than doubled compared with last year's second quarter result. Higher insurance underwriting profits drove most of the improvement, supported by a 13% rise in income from our investment portfolio. Cash and invested assets reached $24.6 billion, reflecting higher valuations and new securities purchased with the healthy cash flow from our insurance operations.""Recording an insurance underwriting profit of $47 million compared to a $52 million loss in last year's second quarter, and a $10 million loss the first quarter of 2023, reflects our determination to stay disciplined in our efforts to segment accounts and to charge an appropriate price for each risk. Even as competition in the market heats up, we've managed commercial lines and excess and surplus lines price increases on average at a high-single-digit percentage rate, and personal lines average increases in the mid-single-digit percentage rates.""Storms continued to increase in frequency, impacting policyholders across the country. Our field claims teams and headquarters claims associates have been busy, responding to around 40 declared catastrophe events in the first half of 2023. I'm proud of their efforts as they brought compassion and expertise to our agents and policyholders, quickly resolving claims and helping affected communities to move forward.""Weather-related catastrophes contributed approximately 12 points to both our second quarter combined ratio of 97.6% and first half combined ratio of 99.2%. While these combined ratio results are within our long-term target of 95% to 100%, we believe continuing to stick to our model and focusing on the basics of our business will sustain the momentum we've gained in the second quarter and improve results during the second half of the year.""Disciplined Growth Through All Market Cycles""We believe combining our hallmark of personal service with data-driven analytics will allow us to grow profitably through all market cycles. Through the first half of 2023, net written premiums grew 8%, bolstered by the strategic expansion of our independent agency force, overall insured exposure growth and price increases plus the opportunities we've seen in Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd.SM and Cincinnati Re®, and in our personal lines and excess and surplus lines insurance operations.""For the first half of 2023, new business written premiums for our personal lines operation grew 32%, and excess and surplus lines new business written premiums grew 25%.""Most importantly, we are growing with discipline and precision. The investments we've made in pricing and risk management expertise, along with our geographic and product diversification over the past decade, put us in a strong position to know and take advantage of opportunities for profitable growth.""Creating Value for Shareholders""Our value creation ratio, which considers changes to our book value and the dividends we pay to shareholders, is our main measure for evaluating the value we are creating as a company over time. The board increased our dividend rate in January, and so far this year our book value per share has grown 5% to $70.33. Our results generated a six-month value creation ratio of 7.2% – within striking distance of our 10% or better average annual target for this measure.""Insurance Operations HighlightsConsolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results(Dollars in millions)Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,20232022% Change20232022% ChangeEarned premiums$1,863$1,69710$3,704$3,31512Fee revenues3250550   Total revenues1,8661,699103,7093,32012Loss and loss expenses1,2621,24022,5792,19617Underwriting expenses55751191,0931,0118   Underwriting profit (loss)$47$(52)nm  $37$113(67)Ratios as a percent of earned premiums:Pt.

Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules for insurance company regulation in the United States of America as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segments plus our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re and our London-based global specialty underwriter known as Cincinnati Global.Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.Cincinnati Financial Corporation Net Income Reconciliation(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,2023202220232022Net income (loss)$                  534$                (818)$                  759$             (1,084)Less:   Investment gains and losses, net434(1,154)540(1,820)   Income tax on investment gains and losses (91)242(113)382   Investment gains and losses, after-tax343(912)427(1,438)Non-GAAP operating income$                  191$                     94$                  332$                  354Diluted per share data:Net income (loss)$                 3.38$               (5.12)$                 4.80$               (6.77)Less:   Investment gains and losses, net2.74(7.23)3.41(11.37)   Income tax on investment gains and losses (0.57)1.52(0.71)2.38   Investment gains and losses, after-tax2.17(5.71)2.70(8.99)   Non-GAAP operating income$                 1.21$                 0.59$                 2.10$                 2.22Life Insurance Reconciliation(Dollars in millions)Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,2023202220232022Net income of the life insurance subsidiary$                     21$                     11$                     40$                     28Investment gains and losses, net (2)—(1)—Income tax on investment gains and losses————Non-GAAP operating income23114128Investment income, net of expenses (46)(42)(91)(84)Investment income credited to contract holders30286055Income tax excluding tax on investment gains and losses,   net64119Life insurance segment profit$                     13$                       1$                     21$                       8 Property Casualty Insurance Reconciliation (Dollars in millions)Three months ended June 30, 2023ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           2,150$            1,106$              629$              156$                259   Unearned premiums change(287)(40)(136)(24)(87)   Earned premiums$           1,863$            1,066$              493$              132$                172Underwriting profit (loss)$                47$                 33$               (36)$                11$                  39(Dollars in millions)Six months ended June 30, 2023ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           4,169$           2,247$           1,077$              292$                553   Unearned premiums change(465)(125)(120)(33)(187)   Earned premiums$           3,704$           2,122$              957$              259$                366Underwriting profit (loss)$                37$                 31$               (93)$                24$                  75(Dollars in millions)Three months ended June 30, 2022ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           1,964$           1,072$              510$              135$                247   Unearned premiums change(267)(78)(97)(11)(81)   Earned premiums$           1,697$              994$              413$              124$                166Underwriting profit (loss)$               (52)$               (62)$               (49)$                19$                  40(Dollars in millions)Six months ended June 30, 2022ConsolidatedCommercialPersonalE&amp;SOther*Premiums:   Written premiums$           3,863$           2,168$              884$             259$                552   Unearned premiums change(548)(212)(69)(23)(244)   Earned premiums$           3,315$           1,956$              815$             236$                308Underwriting profit $              113$                14$                16$               35$                  48  Dollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding. *Included in Other are the results of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.Cincinnati Financial CorporationOther MeasuresValue creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules in the U.S., property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.Value Creation Ratio Calculations(Dollars are per share)Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,2023202220232022Book value change per shareBook value as originally reported June 30, 2022$           66.30Cumulative effect of change in accounting for long-duration insurance contracts,net of tax(0.30)Book value as adjusted June 30, 2022$           66.00Value creation ratio:   End of period book value* - as originally reported $          70.33$           66.30$          70.33$           66.30   Less beginning of period book value - as originally   reported  68.3375.4367.0181.72   Change in book value - as originally reported 2.00(9.13)3.32(15.42)   Dividend declared to shareholders0.750.691.501.38   Total value creation $            2.75$           (8.44)$            4.82$         (14.04)Value creation ratio from change in book value**2.9 %(12.1) %5.0 %(18.9) %Value creation ratio from dividends declared to shareholders***  1.10.92.21.7Value creation ratio4.0 %(11.2) %7.2 %(17.2) %    * Book value per share is calculated by dividing end of period total shareholders' equity by end of period shares outstanding  ** Change in book value divided by the beginning of period book value *** Dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of period book value Cincinnati Financial Corporation logo.

Now I'll turn the call over to Lane for opening remarks.R. Lane RiggsThank you, Homer, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss quarterly results, I want to thank Joe Gorder for everything he's done to build upon Valero's 43-year history. Joe steered a repositioning of our strategy and the commitment to shareholder returns through capital discipline, innovation and strong execution. I'm grateful for his leadership and proud of what Valero has accomplished, and I'm honored to build on that foundation as we continue to advance our position as a leading manufacturer of liquid transportation fuels.Moving on to quarterly results. We are pleased to report solid financial results in the second quarter, underpinned by our strong execution across all of our business segments. Our refineries ran well with throughput capacity utilization of 94% as refinery margins were supported by continued tight product supply and demand balances. Product demand was strong with our U.S. wholesale system setting a sales record of over 1 million barrels per day in May and June. We also had a positive contribution from the Port Arthur Coker project, which was started up in early April and is operating well and at full capacity. The new coker has increased the refinery's throughput capacity and enhance its ability to process incremental volumes of heavy crude and residual feedstocks. Our Renewable Diesel segment set records for operating income and sales volumes in the second quarter, driven by incremental production volumes from Diamond Green Diesel, Port Arthur. The Diamond Green Diesel sustainable aviation fuel project at Port Arthur is progressing on schedule. Plan is expected to have the ability to upgrade 50% of the current 470 million gallon annual renewable diesel production capacity through Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF, is expected to be complete in 2025 and has estimated a cost of $315 million, with half of that attributable to Valero. With the completion of this project, DGD is expected to become one of the largest manufacturers of SAF in the world. These projects expand our long-term competitive advantage, and I want to commend our projects and operations team for their dedication and execution. We also continue to evaluate other opportunities, while maintaining capital discipline and honoring our commitment that all projects meet a minimum return threshold. On the financial side, we returned 53% of the adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter. And we ended the second quarter with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 18%. Looking ahead, we expect low global light product inventories and tight product supply-and-demand balances to continue to support refining fundamentals. Global demand for transportation fuels has recovered substantially with gasoline and diesel demand now comparable to pre-pandemic levels and jet fuel demand continues to increase steadily. In closing, we remain committed to the core strategy that has been in place under Joe's leadership for nearly a decade. Our focus on operational excellence, capital discipline and honoring our commitment to shareholder returns have served us well and will continue to anchor our strategy going forward. So Homer, with that, I'll hand the call back to you.Homer BhullarThanks, Lane. For the second quarter of 2023, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.9 billion or $5.40 per share compared to $4.7 billion or $11.57 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2022 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $4.6 billion or $11.36 per share.The Refining segment reported $2.4 billion of operating income for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $6.2 billion for the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating income was $6.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022. Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2023 averaged 3 million barrels per day, implying a throughput capacity utilization of 94%. Refining cash operating expenses were $4.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2023, lower than guidance of $4.60, primarily attributed to lower-than-expected natural gas prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $440 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $152 million for the second quarter of 2022. Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023, which was 2.2 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022. The higher sales volumes in the second quarter of 2023 were due to the impact of additional volumes from the start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Ethanol segment reported $127 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $101 million for the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2022 was $79 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2023, which was 582,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2023, G&amp;A expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $148 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $669 million and income tax expense was $595 million for the second quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was 22%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $1.2 billion in the second quarter and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion. Regarding investing activities, we made $458 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2023, of which $382 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $76 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD, capital investments attributable to Valero were $433 million in the second quarter of 2023. Moving to financing activities. We returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2023, of which $367 million was paid as dividends and $951 million was for the purchase of approximately 8.4 million shares of common stock resulting in a payout ratio of 53% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. Last week, we announced a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.02 per share payable on September 5, 2023, to holders of record at the close of business on August 3, 2023. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $9 billion of total debt, $2.3 billion of finance lease obligations and $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 18% as of June 30, 2023. And we ended the quarter well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and the balance to growth. For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect Refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.77 million to 1.82 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 240,000 to 260,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day. We expect Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be above $145 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $690 million. For 2023, we expect G&amp;A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting, each turn in the Q&amp;A to 2 questions. If you have more than 2 questions please rejoin the queue as time permits to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question is coming from Manav Gupta of UBS.Manav GuptaGuys, I just want to quickly start with and congratulate Gary for the promotion and the new role and all our best wishes are with you. The first question I have for you is that, when we look at DGD, you guys have a track record of bringing projects online before time. So is there a possibility a year down the line, you could take a look at it and say, we would like to have similar upgrades possible at DGD 1 and 2 to make more sustainable aviation fuel on a go-forward basis?Eric FisherYes. Manav, this is Eric. Obviously, that is a possibility because those are cookie-cutter units, and we could do the exact same project at St. Charles that we are currently underway at Port Arthur. It's too early to talk about any numbers or commitment, but yes, so it's definitely something we're looking at and something that we could do.Manav GuptaGood. The second question here is the DOE data is telling us whatever it is, and there are obviously some concerns around demand out there, but the cracks are telling us a completely different story. The cracks are telling us the demand for products is remarkably strong. So just wondered if you could highlight some of the -- what you're seeing in terms of demand in various regions?Gary K. SimmonsYes, Manav, this is Gary. We do believe that the DOE is understating gasoline demand. But even their data is showing on a 4-week average basis gasoline demand up about 3%. But if you look at our numbers, of course, Lane mentioned we had record volumes in both May and June of over 1 million barrels a day. We're seeing gasoline sales in our system up 14% year-over-year, up 22% from pre-pandemic levels. Gasoline inventory year-over-year is down 7.5 million barrels. So it's trending at the low end of the 5-year average range. Typically, this time of year, you have an open arb to ship barrels from Europe into the United States. But with inventory low in Europe, that arb is closed, which is hindering imports, and we see strong export demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast into South America. So the fundamentals around gasoline look very good. Diesel inventory is up 6 million barrels, but continues to trend below the 5-year average range. Diesel inventory is flat, where historically, this time of year, we start to see diesel building. Again, while the DOE reflects weaker diesel demand year-over-year, it looks like the weekly data is continually being revised up. So although we certainly had picked it, we had a weaker heating oil season, diesel demand looks fairly similar to last year. So we moved forward a lot of encouraging signs around diesel, where we saw weaker tonnage index in the second quarter, the June data reflects that the tonnage index is picking back up. We'll start to see more agricultural demand as we get into harvest season and more heating oil demand as we get into colder weather. Continue to see very good export demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast into South America. Some of that has fallen off as we've replaced some supply with Russian barrels, but largely been replaced with more export demand from the U.S. Gulf Coast into Europe. Jet demand also picking up and had a positive impact on overall distillate supply/demand balances. So the distillate demand looks up 10% year-over-year. It looks pretty strong. All the airlines are reporting very strong demand. Jet trading at a $0.10 per gallon premium in the U.S. Gulf Coast on a rent-adjusted basis today. So yes, the fundamentals look very, very good.OperatorThe next question is coming from John Royall of JPMorgan.John Macalister RoyallSo my first 1 was just on the coker. It sounds like you're running full now and the start-up went as planned. But maybe you can just go through any puts and takes around profitability? I know heavy dips have come in, for example, the diesel cracks are improving recently. And -- should we think about there being a structurally higher Gulf Coast capture now? And any way to think about quantifying that?Unidentified Company RepresentativeJohn, this is Greg Bram. So as Lane mentioned, the coker started up in April. And I think it's probably worth noting the project and operating teams did a great job bringing that unit online safely without incident. And that's after we accelerated the schedule last year to be in a position to capture value from that project here in 2023. We've ramped it up to full capacity over the course of the quarter, and it's running well and median expectations. And I think with that, you can take kind of the guidance we've given in the past and think about where the market is today and adjust accordingly. I don't think we have really a new or different view because the project is really doing what we expected it to do.John Macalister RoyallGreat. And then maybe along the same lines, it would be great to get your thoughts on heavy and medium sour diffs from here with OPEC+ cutting and the second round of the STR release is now over. What are your thoughts on whether we'll see a widening from here on mediums and heavies or will we likely stay in the current environment where from a sour diffs perspective?Gary K. SimmonsYes, this is Gary. I think we have seen the discounts widen back out some as we've moved throughout the third quarter. I think there's some reason for optimism as we head into fall turnaround season, had 2 and 3, you'll see some decreased demand for heavy sour crude, which will help the differential some. I think we'll see some more production growth out of Western Canada as they come out of maintenance season, which would put more barrels back on the market. Should continue to see a ramp-up in Chevron production from Venezuela heading into the U.S. Gulf Coast. And then finally, there's some seasonal factors which should help the discounts as well. High sulfur fuel oil for power burn will begin to wind down seasonally, which will put more high sulfur fuel on the market, help the discounts there. And then as we transition into winter weather, you would expect to see higher natural gas prices, which changes the economics for some refineries around the world that have been processing medium and heavy sour crews, which have helped the discounts as well.OperatorThe next question is coming from Theresa Chen of Barclays.Theresa ChenOn the SAF front, would you mind giving an update on the Navigator BlackRock CCS project? And how is the permitting and right-of-way procurement process going?Richard Joe WalshTheresa, it's Rich. I'll start out by saying that the Navigator project is progressing. They've got parallel proceedings in front of each of the state's respective utility boards and/or counties and the regulatory proceedings in Iowa are taking longer than they anticipated. And so Navigator is not expecting regulatory approval until the back half of 2024, which will naturally push their timeline back. And they've not announced -- and they haven't given any update on a new start-up schedule. So...Theresa ChenAnd in terms of additional SAF opportunities in the DGD facilities, Eric, can you just opine a bit more on how would you think about like the key hurdles and it would take to cross to commercialize additional FIDs?Eric FisherYes. I think what I would say about SAF is the airlines are still in very much an educational phase of this. What they're still trying to wrestle with is I think there is a good understanding of it's going to come from RD. They're starting to understand the credit markets and how they work. But as you know, all of these SAF demands, a lot of them are voluntary from the carriers and as well as because it's voluntary, they've got options on, do they want to accept allocation, do they want to accept -- which model do they want to operate under, where in the world do they want to run these barrels? And I think the learning that everyone is working through right now is conventional jet is a fungible product. And so the SAF will naturally move into fungible markets, just like jet fuel does. But as airlines wants the specific molecule at their particular location, particular airport, even at the airports, it then becomes a fungible product. So all of that becomes a conversation of, okay, how do you then take that sort of real-life logistics and apply it into these policies and goals and how do you want to set up a commercial deal with that? So there's still a lot of details being worked through on how this will physically move into the market. And then as a result of that, how it will price. So I think airlines are still -- we're still working through a lot of those details. I don't see any drop in interest or demand. We see demand still growing strongly through 2030. So I think there's still a lot of upside in this outlook. I think it's -- but we have to work through these commercial details and logistical details.OperatorThe next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateGary, perhaps I could pick on you a little bit given your recent good news. Congrats from me as well. But diesel, a couple of months ago, the world was coming to an end in terms of consensus expectations. And today, we're back at winter-tight premiums for distillate cracks. So I know you touched on it already in some of your comments. But can you maybe speak to what you're seeing that's driving that strength? And I want to address specifically what you're seeing in Asia as it relates to trading. Our understanding is Chinese exports are down and maybe that's creating some tightness globally. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any perspective as to why the split is as strong as it is today?Gary K. SimmonsYes. I think you definitely saw as China ramped up and they didn't have the domestic demand keep up with that initially, you saw a lot of Chinese exports. Some of those barrels were making their way into Europe. And then you had some trade flows that needed to rebalance with the Russian sanction. So initially, we saw a decreased demand from Latin America and so diesel was starting to back up in the U.S. But as trade flows have rebalanced, the Russian barrels that are making their way into Latin America that gap has largely been filled by increased demand from Europe. So if you look for -- in our system in the second quarter of last year, our export is pretty comparable to the second quarter of this year. However, last year, 95% of our volume went to Latin America, 5% to Europe. Second quarter of this year, we had 60% of our exports go to Latin America with 40% to Europe. So you're starting to just see a big pull of diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast into Europe. We thought in the second quarter and thus far in the third quarter that's continuing into (inaudible) that's the real difference.Douglas George Blyth LeggateSo I hope this isn't a second question. This is kind of a clarification question. So are you suggesting that Russian exports are starting to -- they're starting to slow, which I think was the expectation. Is that -- am I reading your comments correctly?Gary K. SimmonsYou know what? We have seen Russian exports slow. I don't know if that's just maintenance activity occurring in Russia, what's driving it. But we have seen some of the South American demand that we feel like we lost the Russian barrels that those countries are back inquiring for supply from us again.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. My follow-up is on capture rates. And it seems to us -- I mean, refining looked in line with consensus for this quarter. The (inaudible) with pretty weak capture in the Mid-Con and North Atlantic. So I'm curious if you can walk us through whether that's transitory, if there was anything specific in the quarter and how you see it trending so far in the third quarter? Whoever wants to take that.Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes, Doug, this is Greg. So as you mentioned, overall capture rates were pretty consistent with what we'd expect from a 1Q to 2Q move. I should mention from the earlier question. In the Gulf Coast, the coker was a positive impact, with the new coker on capture rates in the Gulf. As you mentioned in the Mid-Con, lower there, primarily due to turnaround activity, and you can see that in our lower throughput rates in second quarter versus the first quarter. And then in the North Atlantic, we tend to always see a seasonal shift in the value of Canadian distillates up in that market strong in the winter and then coming off in the spring and summer time. So that was one of the effects we saw there. Then the one that was a bit more unique to this particular period was just higher cost for [St crude] coming out of Canada, primarily impacted by some maintenance and also the wildfires they had up there.Douglas George Blyth LeggateAnd how is that trending into Q3?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes, we're starting to see it moderate a bit, but it will take some time. That usually is not just a very short, short-term effect, but we expect that it will start to improve.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Sankey of Sankey Research.Paul Benedict SankeyMy congratulations to Gary. Can you just keep going a little bit with the outages. On the OPEC cuts, can you talk a little bit about the impact that you've been having on markets from your perspective? The Mexican explosion was another obvious one, just a commentary on how disruptive the crude market is from a buyer's point of view right now? And I got you on Russia, you seem to more or less address that already through Doug.Gary K. SimmonsYes. So certainly, the big move in the crude market has been the OPEC+ production cuts, 4.5 million barrels a day off the market. And I think you're seeing that as global oil demand picks up, and those barrels are not yet back on the market, you're seeing flat price trend higher, and you've definitely seen it in the quality differentials as well. But in addition to the OPEC+ cuts, there were a number of other issues that we mentioned. We had maintenance in Canada on the wildfires in Canada, the platform fire in Mexico. You kind of went from a seller out of the SBR to a buyer into the SBR. So all of those things had a significant impact on the quality differentials in the second quarter, and we're seeing some of those things start to reverse as we move into the third quarter.Paul Benedict SankeyGot it. And then on the outages in Refining. Can you talk a bit -- I mean there was reports of lots of different things happening, not least because of the heat in Texas. Could you talk a bit about anything that happened with you guys in the quarter, but also how the industry perhaps was perhaps throughput was a bit distorted by various units being down and stuff?Unidentified Company RepresentativePaul, this is Greg. I don't know that we can speak a whole lot to what was going on elsewhere. Our operations were very good for the quarter. Good mechanical availability in line with kind of our typical first quartile type of performance. So the weather has had just a very modest impact on any of our operations.Paul Benedict SankeyGot it. And then just finally, a quick one. The 14% you talked about wholesale up is obviously you're taking market share. It seems to be driven by your renewable fuels, right? Is that -- how do we explain the difference between your strength of sales versus the overall market being way below that?Gary K. SimmonsNo. That wouldn't include really what we're talking about on renewables. That would be strictly our U.S. wholesale volumes. I think some of it was due to rationalization that occurred in the industry that allowed us to be more competitive, but we've gone through and in many locations, renegotiated terminal agreements that just allow us to be more competitive in some regions, where we haven't been historically and capture additional market share.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.Ryan M. ToddMaybe a question on the renewable diesel side. I mean can you talk -- obviously, a very strong performance in the quarter. Can you talk about sales in the quarter, which were, I mean, stronger than we had expected? Also had a very strong capture rate, which was much improved. And certainly, I think some benefit from [fat] pricing there. But can you talk about sales? What are the drivers there, implications as we look toward the back half of this year, both on sales and the kind of margin and capture on the renewable resource side?Eric FisherYes. We definitely had -- there's always some timing of ships in our numbers for the quarter, but we do also have the unit running above its original design capacity. So we are running higher rates at DGD 3 as well as seeing strong sales throughout the world as we move into a lot of production moving into Canada with its new CFR that went live in July, and then there's other states that are coming on beyond California. So overall, yes, we did see increased sales due to the combination of some timing of ships and then obviously, we're running above design rates.Ryan M. ToddAnd on the on the margin capture side. Any general comments on what you're seeing, I mean, headline indicators have been falling, but your capture was much improved?Eric FisherYes. The margin -- on the margin capture side, we definitely saw fat price is lower in the second quarter. We saw waste oils become advantaged again. So that improves a lot of our capture rate. If we talk a little bit about RINs and LCFS, those have been pretty much as expected. LCF market has been relatively flat. The EPA came out with its new RIN outlook, and it was largely unchanged. So -- but overall, that's mostly a product. Gary mentioned, we've seen strong ULSD demand. That's the basis of the formula plus, I would say, more attractive fat prices, as you already mentioned.Ryan M. ToddAnd maybe on a different note, with the start-up of the Port Arthur Coker and the capital rolling off from that in terms of growth CapEx, you obviously have the SAF projects underway, but what types of projects might compete for growth capital going forward? Is it more likely to be incremental SAF capacity? Are there things on the refining side that you're looking at, whether it's something to increase octane production or anything like that on the margin side that can compete for capital as you think about the next couple of years?R. Lane RiggsYes. This is Lane. So you can really expect us to continue to look to optimize and look at opportunities around our existing assets. We've been doing that. Some of them aren't big or flashy, but in cumulative, they'll have an effect on our overall performance, and we continue to gate those, just like we always have. And then there is other side of the business, our renewable side. We are looking at the potential to always to gain and develop innovative projects that are sort of in the transportation fuel space that leverage our operations excellence and our project execution capabilities.OperatorThe next question is coming from Joe Laetsch of Morgan Stanley.Joseph Gregory LaetschGreat. So I want to go back to capture rate here. So we noticed just on the West Coast Refining margins were really strong during the quarter. Could you just touch on some of the drivers here and how we should think about the setup for the third quarter?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes, this is Greg. So on the West Coast, we had great operations out there. But there really, the thing to note there is Benicia has a very, very high gasoline yield in terms of its product mix. So when gasoline is very strong relative to distillate products out in the West Coast, we see strong capture rates out there driven by Benicia's yield. That's the primary factor you saw in the second quarter.Joseph Gregory LaetschGreat. That's helpful. And then just -- my second one is just on OpEx and just the drivers of higher OpEx in third quarter versus 2Q. Is that on the nat gas side? Or how should we think about that?R. Lane RiggsLet me -- this is Lane. It's really driven by slightly a higher outlook for natural gas in the third quarter than the second quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadYes. Congrats to everybody on there for the new roles here. I'd like to hit the diesel question a slightly different way. Last winter, we saw pretty unusually warm weather throughout Northern Hemisphere. So going back, I think you addressed this on the last call, but what do you think the missing demand was last year from a weather standpoint. And so when we think about the upcoming winter and we always just model normal weather. So what will we potentially be looking at from a demand step up?Gary K. SimmonsRoger, we have modeled that, but I don't have the number in front of me, and I don't want to give you a bad number, but we can follow up with you with Homer and get you the number we had on heating oil demand.Roger David ReadOkay. That's helpful. The other is, we have, I think somebody mentioned earlier, seeing diesel move back up over gasoline. Can you give us an idea of how you've run in terms of being max diesel or I should say, max distillate or max gasoline as we've been coming through this summer?Unidentified Company RepresentativeRoger, we've been mostly in max gasoline mode, but we've been watching that movement between those 2 products. And we'll make that shift when we start to see that kind of swing cut drive us back the other way. One of the things maybe just to keep in mind is on that swing cut, as you keep that heavier part of the gasoline and the gasoline pool, it pulls in more butane into the blend pool. And when you look at where butane prices are currently that's really attractive to get as much butane in the blend as you can.Roger David ReadYes, NGLs are definitely help in or hurt depending on which side of the argument you're on there.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.Paul ChengCongratulations to everyone with a new role. Lane, I have 2. I apologize because I joined late, so if my question has already been addressed, just let me know and I will look at the transcript. Two questions. First, with the heavy oil discount and medium sour, it's also come down [mass discount], it doesn't seem like it's really made that attractive today. Is it really profitable for you guys to run those barrels? And if it is not, is there any way that -- for you to further minimize? What is the minimum that you have to run? The second question is that in the (inaudible) is there any reason why the margin capture drop so severely from -- in the second quarter, I mean not just comparing to the first quarter, but comparing to the last couple of years that you've been running, say, call it 100%, 95% to maybe 120%. And so is there any particular reason or there is some one-off unique circumstances that we are seeing?R. Lane RiggsPaul, Mr. Bram is going to answer that.Unidentified Company RepresentativePaul, I'll start with the first 1 on the different crudes. If I understood your question, we see incentive to run the heavy grades as well as the lights right now. The advantage for heavy crudes narrowed quite a bit as we got into the quarter. As Gary mentioned, those differentials start to move back out that will increase the incentive to move -- to continue to process the heavy grades. The medium sours have probably been the one that have been least attractive, and we would need to see those be -- have a wider discount to the light sweet grades before we would start to make a shift there. On your question -- your capture rate question...Paul ChengActually, before we go into the capture, can I ask that how much that you can maybe further minimize on the medium sour?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes, we can minimize quite a bit. Paul, one thing to keep in mind is there's different parts of the country, different parts of even the Gulf Coast region, where the medium sours particular grades will still be attractive to run it and we'll process those. In the places where that medium grade is not as attractive, the easiest way to think about it is, in a lot of cases, we can -- can run a combination of heavy and lights to essentially kind of mirror what a medium grade looks like, but do that at a lower cost than buying the medium sour crude itself.Paul ChengOkay. That will do. And...Unidentified Company RepresentativeOkay. And then your capture rate, was that around the North Atlantic...Paul ChengNorth Atlantic. That's right.Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. Yes, Paul, primarily, the one thing that was unique about the second quarter was the higher crude cost and again, driven by higher prices for Syncrude out of Canada, both maintenance and wildfire-related, that was probably the thing that caused kind of that region to look different this quarter than it would typically for a second quarter period.Paul ChengBut Syncrude is probably represent 20% at most for your entire North Atlantic input, right?Unidentified Company RepresentativeNo, it's much higher than that, Paul.Paul ChengProbably, it's much higher? So that Quebec city is really winning that much Syncrude?Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes. Our Quebec refinery runs a combination of Canadian crudes and then waterborne crudes that we bring up from the Gulf Coast.OperatorThe next question is coming from Nitin Kumar of Mizuho Securities.Nitin KumarI just want to start with, can you comment on the recent EPA decision to deny RFS favors for small refiners? And how does that look for your ethanol business, I think you mentioned volumes were flat, but can you talk a little bit about pricing for ethanol?Richard Joe WalshThis is Rich Walsh. I can talk of, I guess, a little bit about the EPA decision. And then when it comes to pricing, I'll hand it back off to Eric Honeyman. I mean we don't have any small refinery exemptions in play. And so it's -- it's a bit of a nonfactor for us. I mean really not a lot more to share on it in that regard.Eric HoneymanYes. And then as far as the commercial impact of that, it's a bit -- we see the same thing, a bit of a nonevent and we really don't know the compliance posture of those small refiners. So it's not -- we don't see a big impact to any of our businesses on the small refinery exemption.Nitin KumarSorry, what I was actually referring to is on your commercial side, whether you were seeing any improved demand for ethanol because those guys don't have the exemption. I guess I'll ask a different question as well. Just on the sustaining CapEx, you mentioned $1.5 billion for this year. Are you seeing anything on the regulatory front that could increase that or increase the intensity of your sustaining CapEx in the future thinking of things like stringent particular emission standards or anything like that?R. Lane RiggsThis is Lane. When you look at our history on our sustaining capital and some of these things, we are actually ahead of our competitors looking like flare gas recovery and some of these sort of things. So with respect to regulatory capital, we're in good shape, and we're still willing to stick with our $1.5 billion of sustaining. On average, that doesn't mean it can ebb and flow really with turnaround timing.OperatorThe next question is coming from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaLane, Gary and Joe, if you're on the line, congratulations to each of you. And that's kind of where I want to start. I mean, Lane, that over the last couple of years, the strategic vision has been very clear and consistent. We would just love your perspective as you step into this new role. What are the 2 or 3 things that you're most focused on to take Valero to the next level?R. Lane RiggsThanks, Neil. So I mean, Joe and I really -- I worked with Joe on the strategy for the last 9 years. Obviously, Joe and I go way back before that. So it's not like -- I've been a part of the current strategy that's been successful. I don't think you should expect us to deviate substantially from where we've been strategically. In terms of my areas of focus. I think the first area of focus is just making sure everybody understands exactly that, right? We are -- we have a -- we've been very successful in our execution, maintaining our operations excellence, our ability to execute squarely and be great executor of the projects. And I want to make sure that, that continues. And I want to make sure that we stay disciplined, we stay predictable, and those are all the things that I think I can even make sure that's going on for the foreseeable future. With that, I'm going to inflict Joe, keep working in this innovative project space, look for our opportunities to spend some of our strategic capital and in some of these opportunities that are around our assets, whether it's Diamond Green or SAF or some of the other things that we obviously have done been ahead of everybody else and we think we can continue to be that company.Neil Singhvi MehtaAnd then the follow-up is just around return of capital. And just maybe you could provide an update. It was another quarter where you were able to return cash in excess of sort of the brackets that you talked about historically. And how are you thinking about with the stock having done well here more recently, continuing to lean into the buyback versus reinvest back in the business and talk about the dividend as well.Jason W. FraserYes. I don't think there's any revisiting of our approach to capital (inaudible) really strong performance. And I'm sorry, with regard to like buybacks and dividend, we're going to continue our same approach as well. As far as going above our long-term target of 40% to 50% return to shareholders, historically, to back before the pandemic, we had been at the high end or above our target range pretty regularly. As in last year, we got back to the 45% midpoint of our range, while at the same time getting our debt back down to pre-pandemic levels and building cash. So we got ourselves back in the good posture that we were comfortable with. And we'd also said with that accomplished, we'd be at the midpoint or above going forward. In the second quarter, like you said, we were up above our 50% range. We had a 53% payout. Year-to-date, we're at 52% payout. So this year, we've clearly trended above 50%. And going forward, as in the past, as I said back before COVID, this was an unusual circumstance for us, we won't hesitate to pay out above the upper end of the range for the year, where we think that's the best use of our excess cash under the circumstances. And on the dividend, we continue to have the same approach to it. We want our dividend to be positioned. We want our yield to be positioned competitive versus our peers. We wanted to be growing and sustainable through the cycle. So that continues to be our approach on the dividend. That's how we'll set it and then the buybacks will continue to serve as a flywheel to round out our return to get us to our targets.OperatorThe next question is coming from Jason Gabelman of Cowen.Jason Daniel GabelmanFirst, I want to ask on the renewable fuel standard as well and the outlook for RIN prices and the impact of the business. There's a decent amount of concern that there's going to be an oversupply of RINs next year, and that has implications both for Diamond Green Diesel as well as on Refining and the ability to capture some of the pass-through of the RIN cost in the crack. So I was wondering if you have any comments around your RIN outlook as it relates to impacts to both of those segments given some risk to RIN prices moving lower next year? And I have a follow-up.Eric FisherYes, this is Eric. On the RIN prices, the EPA held the ethanol requirement of 15 billion gallons, which as we've seen over the last several years, is beyond the blend wall, which means the D4 RIN will be used to fulfill that obligation. Given our outlook, we don't see a big change in RINs, RIN prices or RIN supply. We see that as relatively business as usual.Jason Daniel GabelmanI mean, I guess, if I could just push back a little bit. There is a lot of new renewable diesel capacity coming online next year. So it does seem like there's going to be a lot more RIN supply. I don't know if that enters into your thought process as you look out next year?Eric FisherYes. If you -- we're not going to speak on everyone else's projects, but we do see that a lot of the RD projects are taking longer to come up and their projects are being slowed down. So our outlook is the expected growth curve of RD is not going to be as aggressive as a lot of predictions.Jason Daniel GabelmanOkay. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is just going back to the outlook on cracks. And I think a lot of investors have been surprised at the strength we're seeing in cracks and so kind of 2 parts to this one. Do you think the kind of hotter-than-normal weather globally has supported diesel demand at all? You've already mentioned that you're not going to comment on refining operations of your peers in the warm weather. So wondering if there's been a demand impact, though, from the hot weather? And then the second part is, can you talk about just given you mentioned inventory, product inventories are low. The path forward to rebuilding those, given the global capacity seems to be running all out. How does the world restock gasoline and diesel, which are at or below historical levels?Gary K. SimmonsYes, Jason, this is Gary. I don't know that we can see that the warmer weather has caused a significant change in diesel demand. I think where inventories are low in the United States, we're seeing the same thing globally, low diesel inventories and a pull from the United States into -- especially into Europe, very high as a result of low inventories globally.Moving forward, I don't know really where the path is in terms of restocking the inventory. If you look, we're 35 million barrels below the 5-year average. Last year at this time, we were 35 million barrels below the 5-year average. So we really aren't making a dent in it. If you look going forward, yes, there's new refining capacity coming online, but when you look at the stated nameplate capacity of that new refining capacity and you look at the estimates of global oil demand growth, it doesn't look like a significant impact on the supply-demand balances going forward.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairDo you have any thoughts on the expected impact on RD margins in 2025, when the BTC converts to a PTC? As we look at it, it appears the dollar per gallon subsidy would go down with the PTC. But then, it seems like you might be helped out by just less competition from foreign RD imports. Does that make sense on your end and is there anything else you would add there?Eric FisherYes, I think you've got that surrounded. The one thing I would add is when you go to a carbon intensity basis for the PTC, that will advantage Diamond Green Diesel because we run the lowest CI feedstocks. So whatever the PTC becomes, we will still have the highest capture of PTC versus our peers. So there's no doubt that it becomes a fraction of a dollar based on CI, but we'll still have the most advantaged platform.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairGreat. And then on the ethanol side, is an alcohol to jet SAF projects still a long-term possibility? And could you -- if so, could you compare that to what you're doing currently at DGD? Like how did the 2 production techniques compare in terms of capital cost, operating cost, scale and do airlines distinguish between the 2 different types of fuel?Eric FisherYes, I think -- yes, that's a lot of questions there. Well, what I would say is -- so the first question of is there a pathway to take ethanol into jet fuel. The answer is yes, post sequestration. That is -- it does allow ethanol to become a viable feedstock into that market. It's way too early to talk about numbers and capital and all of that from a project standpoint. But if you look at it from the airline standpoint, they do see that the first barrel of SAF that they will get ratably will be RD based. There is -- as that conversion goes through the RD markets, the next barrel could be from an ethanol source. But that's, that like you said, that's much further out there on the timeline. So yes, and then if you look at in terms of is the technology there? And is there a capability there? And will airlines differentiate between the 2? Again, probably too soon to tell. But from a fuel standpoint, there's no difference between an ethanol-based barrel versus an RD based barrel from a SAF standpoint. But a lot of work to be done first on how RD will price SAF into the market, and then these are all much further down the timeline.OperatorAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Bhullar for closing comments.Homer BhullarThanks, Donna. Appreciate everyone joining us today. And please feel free to contact the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thanks, everyone.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.]"

This compares to earnings of $11.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil refiner would post earnings of $7.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.27, delivering a surprise of 14.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Valero Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $34.51 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $51.64 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Valero Energy shares have lost about 0.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Valero Energy?While Valero Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Valero Energy: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

Wagner calls the homebuilder company the ""alpha architect"" in housing buydowns that see homebuyers squeezed out of markets due to mortgage rates.

You also have two names that you're saying that investors should avoid right now. So let's get into that. David Wagner of Aptus Capital Advisors, Portfolio Manager.David, let's start with your first pick, and that's a homebuilder play. Clearly, we have seen the homebuilders get some momentum as some of the inventory constraints within the housing market. Potential buyers are left with new construction almost as the only option right now. Your pick is Lennar. Why does that stand out in the group?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, it's actually more of a whole macro play for the entire group. I think when we started-- when I started looking at these stocks back in May, I was definitely a contrarian. But you know, Seana, you hit the nail on the head from a macro perspective. That resale market that you're seeing out there right now is obsolete. There's nothing there.Story continuesI think the year-over-year number on the resale inventory was down like 21%. So that allows these homebuilders to start taking market share. But not only that, look what Lennar was doing. They were, kind of, the alpha architect of this mortgage rate buy down system, which is definitely, kind of, an industry standard right now.We know that the 30-year mortgage rates are closer to, say, 7%. But they're offering these buyers 4 and 1/2%, 5% right now. So how can people turn that down? So what they're doing is they're basically creating a competitive moat around the entire industry that was once considered to be very commoditized in a way. So even at valuations of 1.8 times book, I'm still very bullish here because I just see the runway for growth continuing for quite some time.AKIKO FUJITA: Another stock you like is UnitedHealthcare. Walk me through your thesis there.DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, with homebuilders there's more macro, and I'm a fundamental investor at heart. And this is straight valuation here right now. If you actually look at UNH last year, they're trading about a 30% premium to the market. Right now they're trading at a 10% discount.Basically, levels that we're seeing is during a period of Medicare for All back in 2013, 2014. So it's one of the cheapest times I've ever seen this stock on a relative basis, and it's far one of the highest quality stocks I've seen in the S&amp;P 500 and obviously, number one in the healthcare industry for me.I mean, look what the management team did to, kind of, diversify their book out of their insurance business into Optum. And now I think that they're starting to look for that third leg of growth that could come through some type of AI beneficiary. I know that's a buzzword, and we don't know when that's going to play out. But I do think in longer term, they have the abilities to utilize that AI, that data to decrease costs and increase volume. So you couple that alongside a valuation, what I think should be trading at maybe a 20% premium instead of a 10% discount, I think this stock is a no-brainer.SEANA SMITH: Well, David, on the flip side, some of the plays that you're saying investors should avoid right now at all costs, one of that is the sector play. You're warning against utilities, a tough environment right now given those higher rates.DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, Seana, I saw a statistic that actually really surprised me today that right now there's only 15 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have a yield higher than the two-year treasury. And only one of them is actually a utility. And we've known historically that utilities tend to be very defensive in nature. They tend to be that yield play. But now there's a competition for income now with treasuries.So there's no benefit, in my mind, for holding utilities for a lot of these dividend or retiree investors because you get a lower dividend yield and you get a valuation that's exorbitantly high relative to the S&amp;P 500. It's almost like it's the most expensive house in the most expensive neighborhood, so I just don't see it showing the exact defensive characteristics that it has historically.AKIKO FUJITA: And commercial real estate.DAVID WAGNER: That's a tough place to be.AKIKO FUJITA: We were talking about new homes, right? We're talking on the other spectrum of it. There's been so many doom and gloom scenarios there. What is your expectation on what's likely to come, especially when some of that debt is due?DAVID WAGNER: Yeah, I mean, you're seeing a lot of default news basically on a daily basis. But what I try to do is I take the macro data but look at it from what is the stocks really pricing in right now? And I think there could be more degradation in the valuation of these securities, because right now there's not a long runway for growth for these companies. And then they have a weighted average cost of capital headwind that's really moving forward, one on the debt side because debt has become so expensive to a point where the debt is more expensive than the cap rates on a lot of these properties that they're trying to buy.So that's a negative IRR type of project. So they're not going to these projects on. So you're not going to have growth from that. But you could also look at it from a valuation perspective. Yes, valuations have come down, but that means when they need to issue equity, because debt is so expensive, they're not going to be able to do it from a creative manner because it's really weird within REITs, especially or commercial real estate. You actually want a higher valuation, not a cheaper valuation because you want to use that as currency to issue equity out there to get basic cheaper weighted average cost of capital.So right now I just see the sentiment in the space just being too heavy against it. So I'm definitely staying away here.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it's tough to find somebody who's positive on commercial real estate right now.DAVID WAGNER: Maybe that's a pro.AKIKO FUJITA: David Wagner, Aptus Capital Advisors Portfolio Manager. Good to talk to you.DAVID WAGNER: Thanks for having me.]"

And with that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CEO, Nick Zarcone.Story continuesDominick P. ZarconeThank you, Joe, and good morning to everybody on the call. I hope you're all having a safe and enjoyable summer. This morning, I will provide some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter, and then Rick will dive into the financial details and provide an overview of our updated guidance before I come back with a few closing remarks. The second quarter of 2023 was a continuation of what we delivered in the first quarter, where, again, the resilience of our businesses shined through with an exceptional organic revenue growth and strong margins in our North American and European segments, which more than offset the impact of the headwinds experienced by our Specialty and Self-Service segments. The nondiscretionary nature of the parts these core segments distribute, coupled with our ongoing operational excellence initiatives highlights the strength of our business model and our ability to generate robust profitability during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, including flat declining economic growth in several of our markets, decreases in commodity pricing, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the broader European markets and the continued increases in interest rates and its subsequent impact on consumers. The strength of our North American and European segments is evidenced by the fact that in the second quarter of 2023, North America and Europe collectively represented roughly 90% of our total segment EBITDA versus 79% for the second quarter of 2022 and just 74% in 2021. The variance in performance across our operating segments this quarter again validates our long-term diversification strategy, both with respect to geography and product and speaks to the true strength of our organization and our portfolio of businesses. Now on to the second quarter 2023 results and year-over-year comparisons. Revenue for the second quarter was $3.4 billion, an increase of 3.2%. Parts and services organic revenue increased 4.8% on a reported basis and 5.4% on a per day basis. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was flat year-over-year and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 0.6% for total parts and services revenue increases of 5.4%. Other revenue fell 23.9% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $281 million as compared to $420 million last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.49, a decrease of 29.5%. The company completed the divestiture of PGW Auto Glass in the second quarter of last year, which generated a pretax gain of $155 million and an after-tax gain of $127 million or $0.45 a share in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income of $291 million in Q2 of 2023 compared to $307 million last year, a decrease of 5.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2023 was flat with last year at $1.09, coming in flat to the prior year is a testament to the strength of our operating performance as we faced headwinds from significantly lower commodity prices and higher interest expense. Rick will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks. Now let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. As you will note from Slide 8, organic parts and services revenue for North America increased 8.3%. North America also reported the highest quarterly EBITDA on record as a stand-alone segment, excluding self-service. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that collision and liability-related auto claims were down 3.1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Similar to Q1, the growth in North America was a combination of price and volume improvements. The pricing impact primarily reflected the year-over-year benefit of increases implemented late in Q2 and Q3 of last year as opposed to further increases in 2023. The volume pickup was particularly evident in the aftermarket product line and was the result of 2 factors. First, having largely worked through the industry supply chain issues and returning to proper levels of inventory enabled us to get back to our historical level of fulfillment rates with year-to-date aftermarket fill rates at their highest level since June of 2020. Second, the impact of the State Farm program continues to unfold nicely and is building demand for aftermarket headlights, tail lights and bumper covers. As previously disclosed, in December of last year, State Farm announced that it would allow the use of these aftermarket part types. Late last month, State Farm announced that they are running yet another pilot, this time in California and Arizona, for the use of a full range of aftermarket collision parts, including sheet metal products like fenders, hoods and trunk lids and other items like side mirrors and grills. As part of this pilot, State Farm requires that these parts to be certified by CAPA, Certified Automotive Parts Association, As many of you know, we are by far the largest distributor of CAPA-certified collision parts in the United States. Importantly, we believe the potential expansion by State Farm into the utilization of these additional aftermarket part types validates both the high-quality standards of our platinum plus private label aftermarket parts offerings and our ability to deliver best-in-class service to State Farm's direct repair network across the country. We will be a beneficiary should State Farm ultimately decide to roll out the use of these additional aftermarket part types on a nationwide basis. This upward trend in our aftermarket sales volumes is consistent with a general rise in alternative part usage or APU, which again approached pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. I am pleased to say that the increase in APU also included an uptick in the recycled parts category, increasing about 140 basis points year-over-year. Combined, aftermarket and recycled parts have witnessed over a 400 basis point improvement in industry-wide APU year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023. Our outperformance is another indicator that we continue to take market share. Noncomprehensive total loss rates decreased sequentially in the second quarter to 20.4% from 20.9% in Q1. With the recent drop in used car prices, we expect total loss rates to slightly pick up for the balance of the year. And then as OEs work through their healthy inventory levels, industry experts believe we will likely see a mix shift to newer vehicles down the road and would expect to see any near-term increase in total losses to reverse course given newer vehicles are less likely to be deemed a total loss. As stated in prior calls, we are generally agnostic as to the small up and down shifts in the total loss rate. Finally, last month, I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with the top-performing general managers and salespeople at an event for our North American business. I must say their enthusiasm regarding the future of LKQ was simply energizing. Now let's move on to our European segment. Europe's organic revenue growth for parts and services in the quarter increased 8.5% on a reported basis and 9.8% on a per day basis. It was a quarter of records for the European segment, which reported the highest quarterly revenue ever at $1.64 billion, the highest EBITDA at $188 million and the highest second quarter EBITDA margin percentage ever at 11.5%. During the quarter, we saw high single-digit to low double-digit reported organic growth in some of our key operating geographies. In particular, our Benelux, Germany and Eastern European operations performed exceptionally well. The revenue growth reflected a combination of positive movements in both price and volume. We are confident we are continuing to take share in these large and highly fragmented markets as witnessed by ECP, our U.K. business, which generated its highest level of per day sales on record. In the second quarter, LKQ Europe entered into a strategic partnership with Mobivia, Europe's largest independent provider of automotive maintenance and repair services operating under 11 brands in 18 countries across Europe. The agreement between Mobivia and LKQ Europe is based on a dual mode of collaboration which includes the procurement and delivery of automotive parts to Mobivia's 530 ATU service branches across Germany. LKQ and Mobivia are both leaders in our respective sectors of the European automotive aftermarket. And thanks to this collaboration, we will leverage our strengths to provide a differentiated solution that is unparalleled in the marketplace. Our European team continues to face cost inflation across all operating markets. And to combat this, the team has taken decisive structural and multiple efficiency actions. These actions resulted in year-over-year improvements in SG&amp;A for the second quarter despite this challenging macro environment. I spent last week in Europe meeting with all the senior leaders across this segment and also with the regional teams in the U.K. and the Benelux region. I am incredibly proud of the performance of the European team in what they are delivering. And I am very excited about all the initiatives they have underway to grow the business and enhance our leading competitive position. The team's focus and drive are outstanding and they are creating a uniquely special and market-leading business. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the second quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 12.9%, which was below our expectations. There were major differences in the demand for various part types with the truck, off-road and marine categories being down less than 2%, while RV and towing related products were off substantially more than the overall segment decline. The RV portion of our Specialty business was impacted by the wholesale shipment and retail sales of RVs, which were down 50% and 20% year-to-date through May, respectively. We expect to see further declines in the RV market as recent industry reports project that full year 2023 wholesale shipments will be down 40% year-over-year. With that, we believe the challenges for our Specialty segment will continue in the back half of the year. Now on to our Self-Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for our Self-Service segment increased 4.7% in the second quarter. Self-service was again challenged by extremely soft commodity pricing particularly as it is related to precious metals. On the corporate development front, during the quarter and recently in July, we completed some smaller, highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions including a U.S.-based remanufacturer and distributor of OE replacement engines, marine replacement engines and high-performance crate engines, a leading independent truck parts distributor in the U.K., a Holland-based automotive aftermarket parts distributor, a Belgium-based business that distributes automotive parts, paint, tools and accessories and aftermarket accessories distributor with locations in Texas and Oklahoma. Additionally, during the quarter, we divested a small noncore business in our Specialty segment. The net annualized revenue impact of these 6 transactions collectively is approximately $240 million. As most of you know, on February 26, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares for CAD 48 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately USD 2.1 billion. The process is on schedule, and we are pleased with our progress. During the second quarter, we received the required approvals from Uni-Select shareholders, the Superior Court of Quebec, the antitrust regulators in the United States and in Canada. On July 21, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom issued its Phase 1 decision on the transaction. And in response, we immediately submitted our proposed undertakings related to the divestiture of Uni-Select's GSF Car Parts business in the U.K. for evaluation by the CMA. In light of those developments, yesterday, we waived the closing conditions relating to regulatory approvals, and I'm happy to announce we plan to complete the acquisition of Uni-Select on or about August 1. The pending divestiture of GSF continues to progress in accordance with our desired time line. After we complete the customary competitive bid sale process, this CMA will complete its suitability review of our proposed buyer. Upon we received an approval of the buyer from the CMA, we will complete the sale of GSF likely in the third quarter. Now turning to ESG. During the order we initiated or expanded various programs that centered around our people - LKQ's most important asset. As part of our response to our employee engagement survey, we identified that ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees is essential to our success. With that engagement data, we took action. We expanded our Inspire to Thrive wellness program globally, which focuses on the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees. We expanded the installation of dash cams across our North America and specialty fleets, a program that enhances the safety of our drivers. And at ECP, our team implemented 2 exciting programs, [25 by 25] and PAVE, which stands for People Adding Value Everywhere. Both these programs are centered around our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Again, we implemented these programs as they are in the best interest of our employees. I could not be prouder of the continued progress on our ESG efforts, which was again validated in June by MSCI maintaining our AAA ESG rating, a rating that very few companies can claim. Lastly, I am pleased to announce that on July 25, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share of common stock payable on August 31, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2023. I will now turn the discussion over to Rick who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2023.Rick GallowayThank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. The second quarter was another solid performance from the business with highlights including record high segment EBITDA margin of 20.6% in North America and at 11.5%, the highest quarterly margin in a decade for Europe, organic revenue growth in the high single digits in North America and Europe, operating improvements countering headwinds from commodity prices and interest costs.Strong free cash flow of $414 million in the quarter and the completion of a $1.4 billion bond offering to secure financing for the pending Uni-Select acquisition. I want to reiterate Nick's thanks to the global LKQ team for delivering exceptional results in difficult conditions. To provide further details on these results, I will start with comments on segment performance.Going to Slide 10. North America continued its strong performance, posting a segment EBITDA margin of 20.6%, a 190 basis point improvement over last year. We saw gross margin improvement of 150 basis points driven by lower freight costs, pricing and productivity initiatives and a favorable mix effect with the sale of the lower-margin PGW business. Overhead expenses were favored by 40 basis points, primarily due to lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses. With the continued strong performance in our North American segment, we believe the full year segment EBITDA margins will finish the year in the low 19% range with some moderation in the second half of 2023 with salvage margins tightening, along with some normal seasonality.Europe also delivered terrific results with a segment EBITDA margin of 11.5%, up 70 basis points from the prior year period. As seen on Slide 11, gross margin improved by 20 basis points, while overhead expenses decreased by 50 basis points with the effect of improved leverage due to the 9.8% per day organic revenue growth and emphasis on productivity initiatives on personnel costs and reduced freight costs. There are some headwinds anticipated in the second half of the year as personnel costs increased due to wage inflation. We intend to mitigate these increases through productivity initiatives, and we remain optimistic about our previously disclosed expectation for full year margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points in 2023.Moving to Slide 12. Specialty's EBITDA margin of 9.5% declined 390 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 370 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors in addition to unfavorable product mix as lower margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions. Overhead expenses were up 20 basis points, primarily from the decrease in leverage driven by organic revenue decline of 12.9% per day. The Specialty team continues to take actions to align the cost structure with revenue trends, and prior restructuring efforts have provided some benefit in the second quarter to counteract the revenue softness.As you can see on Slide 13, Self-Service profitability declined sequentially to 4.1% this quarter from 13.2% in the first quarter and decreased relative to the 15.3% reported in Q2 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results with lower precious metal prices, representing a $15 million reduction in EBITDA and an unfavorable lag effect from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a further $5 million decline. Other revenue decreased by 28.3% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. Relative to Q2 2022, the average price received for catalytic converters in Q2 2023 declined by 39% and scrap steel fell by 20%. While car cost typically move in tandem with changes in commodity prices, we have experienced a stickiness in car costs, which were only down 12% relative to Q2 2022. These trends created a gross margin headwind in the second quarter that could persist in the second half of the year.Now for further details on the consolidated results. As mentioned, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.09 was flat to Q2 last year. Our operational performance showed strong year-over-year improvement with a net increase of $0.11 per share on an adjusted basis, driven by solid gains in North America and Europe, partially offset by the decline in the specialty business. We benefited by $0.04 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. These factors were ex of $0.08 from the impact of metal prices, as shown on Slide 27, $0.05 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases and $0.02 due to a higher effective tax rate. On the tax rate, we applied an annual effective rate estimate of 27.0%, which is 40 basis points higher than the 26.6% in our prior guidance. The rate change is attributable to nondeductible units like transaction costs and other effects related to the Uni-Select financing.As shown on Slide 18, the Uni-Select transaction affected various parts of the second quarter financials. The income statement effects of the pre-acquisition net financing expenses and transaction costs have been excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Once we complete the acquisition, going forward, interest expense will be reflected in adjusted diluted earnings per share. In May, we completed the offering of $1.4 billion of senior notes due in 2028 and 2033. We're happy with the results of the offering as a first-time investment-grade issuer, obtaining financing at 5.75% and 6.25% for the 5- and 10-year maturities was an outstanding outcome. We recorded interest expense on the bonds for the period between the issuance date and the quarter end in the interest expense line on the income statement. The interest earned from the bond proceeds is reflected in interest and other income.In Q1, we hedged the interest rate risk prior to the issuance of permanent financing in the bond market. Upon issuance of the bonds, we unwound these interest rate swaps and settled by making a payment of $13 million. As these swaps qualified for hedge accounting, the loss was held on the balance sheet and will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the bonds. With the completion of the bond offering, we terminated the bridge loan facility and amortized the remaining $6 million of upfront fees in Q2. To hedge the risk related to the movements in the Canadian dollar exchange rates between signing and closing, in Q1, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase Canadian dollars at a specified rate. These contracts had a fair value of $46 million as of June 30. And as we are not eligible for hedge accounting on these contracts, the mark-to-market gain is reflected in the income statement as a separate line item. We incurred M&amp;A advisory costs of $6 million in the quarter, which are presented in restructuring and transaction-related expenses.Shifting to cash flows in the balance sheet. With the $1.4 billion bond offering and CAD 700 million term loan, we have secured the necessary financing for the Uni-Select transaction. By completing the bond offering ahead of the deal closing, we are carrying more cash on the balance sheet than usual at $1.9 billion. If you set aside the roughly $1.4 billion earmarked for the acquisition, we have $519 million in cash and $1.2 billion of available liquidity as of June 30. As of June 30, we had total debt of $4.0 billion with a total leverage ratio of 2.3x EBITDA, which takes into account the additional debt for funding Uni-Select and none of the projected EBITDA from the acquisition. The increase in the total leverage ratio above our target range of 2.0x was expected as we disclosed in our prior Uni-Select communications. We are committed to reducing our leverage ratio below 2.0x within 18 months of closing the transaction. Upon achieving our target leverage ratio, we'll return to our balanced capital allocation strategy, including share repurchases. Our effective borrowing rate rose to 5.3% for the quarter due to global market rate increases. The increase in the leverage ratio above the 2.0x will trigger a 12.5 basis point increase in our credit facility margin going forward. We have $1.7 billion in variable rate debt, of which $700 million has been fixed with interest rate swaps at 4.6% and 4.2% over the next 2 to 3 years, respectively.We produced $414 million in free cash flow during the quarter and at $567 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain on track for our full year estimate of approximately $975 million. Compared to the year-to-date June 2022, free cash flow was down $71 million with higher outflows from income taxes of $39 million, interest of $38 million and capital spending of $37 million. These are the 3 areas we highlighted as headwinds in our February call, and the actual results are playing out mostly as expected. Interest payments will be a larger headwind than originally projected because of higher interest rates and the impact of Uni-Select financing coming on to the books before the acquisition closes. As previously mentioned, we have paused our share repurchase program and directed our free cash flow to paying down debt of $131 million in the second quarter as well as tuck-in acquisitions of $27 million. Additionally, we paid a quarterly dividend of $74 million.I will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2023 results. Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near June levels and the Ukraine Russia conflict continues without further escalation or major additional impact on the European economy and miles driven. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.09 and the pound sterling at $1.25, in line with June rates. We expect reported organic parts and service revenue in the range of 6.0% to 7.5%. Organic growth was 6.4% through June. We decreased the high end of the range in recognition of the ongoing challenges in Specialty, which is down 13% year-to-date. We expect Specialty to reduce the year-over-year decline in the second half of the year, but the lower full year expectation makes reaching 8% at the consolidated level unlikely. Please note, we have 1 fewer selling day in North America, Europe and Specialty in Q3. We expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, which brings in the high end of the range from our previous estimate, while there is no change to the low end. The midpoint is now $4 per share, down $0.05 from our prior figure. We anticipate North America and Europe continue to perform ahead of prior expectations and are mitigating softness in our Specialty segment, resulting in net operational growth of $0.05. However, the negative effects of declining metals prices of $0.07 and higher interest and tax expenses of $0.03 are more than offsetting this operational growth. Slide 5 shows the primary factors contributing to the EPS guidance change. There is no change to our free cash flow expectation of approximately $975 million and 55% annual EBITDA conversion, noting a portion of the Uni-Select transaction fees and pre-acquisition interest costs will have a onetime impact to free cash flow and create a headwind that we expect to overcome. To be clear, the numbers I just quoted do not include operating results for Uni-Select. We expect to close on Uni-Select on or about August 1 and assuming that timing, we are projecting the acquisition will be dilutive to adjusted diluted EPS by $0.02 to $0.04 per share in fiscal 2023. While we believe the transaction will be accretive over the first 12 months, in the early months, it is expected to be dilutive due to the integration costs and the time required to begin to achieve the synergies. Our overall expectation for the businesses have not changed, and we are excited to bring them in as part of the LKQ family.Thank you for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing comments.Dominick P. ZarconeThank you, Rick, for that financial overview. In closing, the second quarter was another solid performance for team LKQ. I am beyond proud of the results we delivered for the first half of the year, particularly how the teams are diligently planning and positioning their respective businesses for the balance of 2023 as we continue to be challenged by certain uncontrollable dynamics.As we move into the second half of the year, let me restate our key strategic pillars, which remain central to our culture and our objectives. First, we will continue to integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, we will continue to focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, we will continue to drive high levels of cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy. And fourth, we will continue to invest in our future. As always, I want to thank the over 46,000 people who work at LKQ for all they do to advance our business each day and for driving our missions and our delivers values forward regardless of the challenges.And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Stember of ROTH MKM.Scott Lewis StemberCongrats on the quarter. In North America, I just wanted to touch on State Farm. I think in previous calls, you had talked about, I guess, based on those 3 SKUs throughout the country, about $100 million in benefit, getting a lot of questions from investors about what the potential is with California and Arizona now going fully live with the whole program.Dominick P. ZarconeSure. I'll take that. Obviously, we are delighted by the movement State Farm is making in terms of utilizing our high-quality aftermarket parts and repair of policyholders' vehicles. You're correct. We previously mentioned that the upside from headlights, tail lights and bumper covers was about $70 million to $100 million on an annual basis once everything gets up and running. We are tracking toward that number. So quite frankly, probably towards the midpoint as there appears to be a little bit of cannibalization on the salvage side in addition to the significant cannibalization on the OEM parts side. .These 3 part types represent the highest volume of aftermarket parts as almost every collision requires the replacement of lights and bumper covers. If you think about 3 equal sized baskets, Scott, of lighting, bumpers and everything else, adding everything else to the bucket would add another 50% or so to our original estimate, which would push you towards somewhere in the $125 million to $150 million on an annual basis over time. Now that's probably a little bit higher than some preliminary guesstimates that some of you have had likely due to the fact that State Farm will only use CAPA-certified parts, and CAPA parts only represent about $1 billion of our overall aftermarket sales. When you add on top of that, that the $1 billion includes chrome bumpers, basically bumpers for pickup trucks that State Farm has been using for the last several years. So if you apply, roughly there is 16% to 17% market share on that lower base, you get back to that $125 million to $150 million on an annual basis of incremental revenue over time. So that's the number that we're comfortable with right now. I would also say that, that's a very nice revenue pickup. And because there's a limited amount of required SG&amp;A to deliver all those incremental parts, we think there will be really good margins on that incremental State Farm business.Scott Lewis StemberSo that $125 million to $150 million, is that an all-in number? Or that's an additional amount just for California and Arizona?Dominick P. ZarconeNo. That's all in. Again, everything else is about 1/3 of the bucket; lights are about 1/3 and bumper covers or about 1/3.Rick GallowayThe pilot, Scott, won't mean much for us as a product to the pilot. So we're -- the numbers that Nick just quoted are assuming they go live at some point in time.Scott Lewis StemberOkay. I'm sorry for blithering the point here, but does that assume that the whole country goes live with all parts 100%?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. Yes.Scott Lewis StemberOkay. Got it. And maybe just walking over to Europe for a second. Obviously, tremendous growth there. It sounds like the volume has picked up nicely. Maybe just talk about some of the things that are really pushing growth there? I know that you guys are taking share and doing a better job. But are you seeing signs of the countercyclical nature of the business to kick in?Dominick P. ZarconeI wouldn't say countercyclical, Scott. I mean the reality is the economies in Europe are in much worse shape than the U.S. economy. If you just look at some of the published statistics, Germany is in a recession, they've had 2 quarters now of negative GDP growth. The U.K. is probably the worst off of any of the economies; the impact of the war, the impact of energy prices inflation. While inflation has come down a bit in the U.S., inflation is hanging pretty high over in Europe. And quite frankly, that's having an impact on the consumer. The fact that we are continuing to grow our business, both from a volume perspective and a price perspective tells us that while may not be countercyclical, we are more than holding our own as it relates to the overall economic backdrop in Europe. Again, good growth. We are highly confident that what this means is, over time, the car park is going to age. And if you talk to anybody in our business, an older car is our friend. So we think that longer term, the soft economic conditions in Europe will actually bode to our favor.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison of Baird.Craig R. KennisonRick, I had a question for you on North American fulfillment rates. Is there any way to quantify the year-over-year increase you saw this quarter? And then how long do you expect tailwinds from that improving fulfillment rate to impact North American organic growth?Rick GallowayYes, it's a good question. Craig, thanks for the question. Fulfillment rates are back to the mid-90s, which is kind of our target, as we've kind of talked in the past, we were low 90s when we think about where we were just a year ago in Q2, actually, we're in high 80s as I'm looking at the numbers. And so we've got about 5 points of improvement. As far as quantification, the difficulty in doing that is that it's a bit of a mixed bag. So I'd hate to quote what the overall benefit was as far as dollars go. As there is a little bit of a movement, and we've talked about this before between the salvage side and the aftermarket, so there's been a little bit of a flip. So when some of the volume went away from aftermarket when the availability wasn't there, it went over to salvage. It's kind of gone back the other way. So we're happy with where we're at. We don't think we need to go much more of where we're at as we're continuing to balance the free cash flow impacts of holding the additional inventories.Craig R. KennisonAnd as you look at like Q3 and Q4 and then 2024, do you still expect tailwinds? Or do you think that has abated from a year-over-year perspective?Rick GallowayYes. I think we're minor improvements, but nothing that's going to be meaningful for us at this time. I mean we're back to not quite where we were pre-pandemic, but I mean it's really, really close.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan of Jefferies.Bret David JordanWith a bit more visibility now, I guess, of the Uni-Select business, could you talk about how you see the synergies having a North American mechanical business in Canada?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. So as we outlined back in late February when we announced the transaction, Bret, we are highly confident that there's $55 million of cost synergies that we will be able to get our hands on over the first kind of 3 years post transaction. Most of that will come in the second year with only a few of those dollars needing a full 3 years to access. We're going to start the process just as soon as we can and trying to deliver the synergies very quickly. And again, there's facility savings. There are some procurement benefits and kind of all the corporate overhead and the like. that we don't need. And so nothing has changed from the presentation that we gave everybody back on February 27, 28 when we announced the transaction. Again, we are highly confident in our ability to do that. Obviously, much of the synergies are going to come in the U.S. That's where the FinishMaster operations and our paint operations overlap. That's where a lot of the synergies come from. We have no plans on eliminating, changing or shutting down facilities up in Canada because we don't do what they do in Canada today, right? They're distributing small mechanical parts. That's the business that we have over in Europe. We do think that there will be benefits -- revenue benefits that we can glean by broadening out their product line, giving them some incremental inventory to cover all car types that are used up in Canada by giving them some capital to grow their business. But none of that is included in the $55 million of benefits that we outlined when we announced the transaction.Bret David JordanOkay. And then you didn't mention (inaudible) in your prepared remarks. Could you give us an update on the third-party diagnostics developments?Rick Galloway(inaudible)Dominick P. ZarconeSo we love our services business. The reality is it's growing about 25% a year, which is obviously significantly higher than any of our other businesses, and it has really strong margins. And so we are very, very happy about that I mean if you look at some industry data, about 75% of all repairs at the MSOs are scanning the car for some of that technology and about 18% of the repairs actually have some sort of calibration work being done on the vehicles. Now the 18% may sound low, but you got to remember that there's only a -- today, there's only a small portion of the car park that has all the technology on it. Average price of a scan is running at about $140. Average price of a calibration is running close to $400. And so it is a really attractive business. And the market is going to continue to grow because every year, there's simply more cars out on the roads with some of that more advanced technology on the car. That's where we got into the business several years ago. We've created what we believe is a market-leading offering, providing a high level of service to our existing customers. by providing some of those services actually in their shops, and we're optimistic about the future.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Butler of Stifel.Brian Joseph ButlerJust when you think about Specialty, it doesn't sound like there's a bounce from the bottom, but do you feel like we've kind of reached the bottom and how to think about where the margins ultimately settle out, maybe kind of back half of '23 and then thinking about '24?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. So it's -- we're not predicting that we're at the bottom yet. The reality, it's been a rough couple of quarters for our specialty business. We have not seen a catalyst that's going to turn quickly. Obviously, as we start to get into 2024, we've got better, easier comps that we'll be working against. And so the numbers from a growth perspective may not look as soft, but from an absolute dollar perspective, we're not anticipating a significant uptick. .The good news is they did some restructuring earlier in the year. They're going aggressively at their cost structure. And so the month of June, they were actually back to double-digit margins even though they weren't there for the quarter. And so I would suggest that margins in and around the 10% range. It's something that we're striving to achieve even though the revenues may be challenged now for several more quarters.Brian Joseph ButlerAll right. That's helpful. And second question, how do you bridge the free cash flow outlook staying the same with the higher interest expense? What is offsetting that?Rick GallowayYes. So if you look at the overall pieces that we've got, the trade working capital for us has been a nice improvement. We continue to see a nice improvement. We saw a really good improvement within Q2 as well. And then the earnings side is the other side of it. So we're really happy with where we ended up in Q2. Overall, trade working capital improved roughly a little less than $180 million, and we expect to continue to drive that throughout the rest of the year.Dominick P. ZarconeOperator, do we have another question?Operator, it appears our phone line had cut off here. I don't know if that's on your end or our end. It appears the operator has a -- provider has a little bit of a technical issue. So if you could please sit tight. Thank you.If the analysts want to send us in an e-mail, maybe send the e-mail over to Joe Boutross, and we'll answer them through e-mail until we get the technical aspect fixed for us.OperatorPardon the interruption. Sorry about that. We now have the next question from the line of Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research.Gary Frank PrestopinoA couple of questions here. With your -- some of the puts and takes on your adjusted EPS guidance, the changes here, which is rather minimal. But in looking at it, it looks like this does not really impact the consolidated segment EBITDA or the consolidated EBITDA that you generate for the year. Is that kind of a correct assumption? It looks like there'll be very little impact from these -- some of these changes.Rick GallowayThe metals will be an impact. But you're right, on the interest side -- on the taxes side, those will be avoided. But the metals impact, you should feather that in.Gary Frank PrestopinoRight. But you're also getting $0.05 from operating results, right?Rick GallowayYes. Yes, exactly. And it's roughly the same, Gary. I mean it's minimal as far as the difference go on the EBITDA side.Gary Frank PrestopinoOkay. And then, Nick, could you -- it seems like Varun has got things really humming over in Europe. Could you maybe talk about some of the actions that they've taken over there that have led to the margin improvement and the segment EBITDA generation in the quarter that were at record levels?Dominick P. ZarconeAs Rick indicated, a lot of the focus came on SG&amp;A. We -- of the 70 basis point improvement, I think we're split 20 basis points in gross margin and 50 basis points in SG&amp;A. So taking a really hard look across all of our platforms to make sure that we're doing the best job possible to control our overhead expenses. Now when you have 9.8% per day organic revenue growth, that helps. But make no mistake, Gary, the inflationary environment, as I indicated over in Europe, is much more intense than it is here in the U.S. And so they've needed productivity gains to offset a lot of that increase and allow us to actually get to a lower SG&amp;A percent as it relates compared to revenues. Rick did indicate that we've got some wage inflation coming at us in Europe in the second half of the year. We know that already. Certain other countries, particularly the Netherlands has another wage increase coming at them. We experienced already a couple of days strike in Germany as the unions over there and the work counsels have their members to use short-term strikes to try and petition for better wages. And so those are all things we're going to have to deal within the second half of the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens.Daniel Robert ImbroRick, I want to start on North American EBITDA margins. Obviously, I think you had guided earlier this year that was stepped down as smaller competitors got inventory and may be used price to get share back, but they've held in much stronger. So I guess what's playing out differently than you thought? Are smaller peers being more rational? Or is there something else driving North American wholesale margin up to offset some of that price competition?Rick GallowayYes. Thanks for the question, Daniel. It's a combination of several different things. One is productivity initiatives have been something that we focused on for a while that are helping to offset any of the risks we're seeing on the pricing side. The other thing is that competition, we believe, has a decent amount of inventory and has been pretty good about holding pricing. So we haven't been looking at a drop in the pricing piece as we were kind of expecting earlier. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, as we think about the back half of the year, there's a little bit more seasonality than anything else and kind of pulling away from the idea of how bad -- how low could the margins go relative to where they're at right now. We're just not seeing it. So I think productivity is one of the biggest things that is offsetting that. And we're continuing to drive it. So we think we'll end up in the low 19s for the full year number as we're coming into the back half of the year.Daniel Robert ImbroAnd then maybe a related follow-up on North America. I think, Nick, you mentioned 400 basis points of APU improvement. That should have been of a guess just a nice tailwind to volume, but could you break out the 8.5% comp? How much was ticket versus like more ticket growth versus more traffic growth? And then are you seeing any change in OEM pricing? I think that's an investor concern out there as OEM production picks up. So how is that side of the pricing backdrop been related to the traffic versus ticket discussion?Dominick P. ZarconeYes. North America, more than half of the year-over-year growth was volume, which is really good to see. Obviously, a lot of that has to do with the aftermarket volume, as we talked about, having the inventory in stock, getting the fulfillment rates up, the State Farm program, all that leads to higher volumes. And the OEs, they've kept -- generally kept their prices steady. They certainly haven't dropped prices. And we don't think that they will. They've never shown a propensity to lower prices, if you will. I mean, there was a period of time where they didn't increase prices for quite a bit. And then they started like everyone else, with inflation and everything else, were taking some prices up. And so we did -- we follow their tracks. So our expectation is that they're going to keep pricing pretty moderate here going forward, and we'll just continue to sell it at a discount to the OE list as we have done forever. People shouldn't anticipate any significant movement on behalf of the OEs or that having an impact on our pricing.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nick Zarcone for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.Dominick P. ZarconeWell, I'd certainly like to thank everyone for your time and your attention this morning. Again, we are very proud of the Q2 results that we were able to report earlier today, and we're looking forward, obviously, to the back half of the year. We certainly look forward to chatting with you again in late October when we announce our third quarter results. And until then, I hope you all have a wonderful end to your summer. Thank you, everyone.OperatorAnd that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the human resources industry, head directly to 5 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Now.Over the past two decades, the staffing industry has seen a rapid change. Gone are the days of aggressively searching newspapers and paper-postings to find employment opportunities. With stratospheric adoption of technology, human resource processes have drastically changed. Given this metamorphosis, businesses now face an unprecedented set of opportunities and challenges. Another major post pandemic change has been the demand for greater work flexibility by employers and employees. Following this, there is a strong expectation for freelance work opportunities to increase. Over the years, freelance platforms have presented a competitive ecosystem where businesses can attract candidates better suited to their needs. Furthermore, as remote work seems to be increasing, experts expect the market for staffing solutions to grow in accordance. With firms looking to outsource more human resource related affairs, competition is only expected to grow in the staffing sector. Don't Miss: 12 Best Staffing Company Stocks To Buy NowAnother major development has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence in various professions. With companies such as Oracle working on developing AI to enhance innovation in business, McKinsey expects staffing companies to take a similar approach by incorporating AI in their cloud-based human resource platforms. A survey by Gartner reported that while only 17% of total staffing companies used AI in 2019, the percentage was set to increase to over 30% by the end of 2022. Although AI can be incorporated in various staffing procedures, it presents a series of challenges as well. The biggest challenge would be the funding costs for development and integration of AI in processes. Safety, security, and privacy are other concerns that are inherently built into AI exploration. Another technical issue could be integrating new features into currently used systems. Needless to say, there is a room for a lot of innovation in the industry.Story continuesIn 2021, the PGC Group reported that the staffing industry in the United States approximately grew by 28% to generate sales in excess of $186.9 billion. It was also reported that the sector had outgrown market expectations by $6 billion. In terms of market size, the US market dominates the industry. As per IBIS World, the total market for the human resources and staffing industry can potentially exceed $760 billion in 2023.  Investors looking to diversify their holdings and benefit from the growth opportunity in the human resources and staffing market can check out stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). Our Methodology We selected the following human resources stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 11 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy TodayRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comBest Human Resources Stocks To Buy Today11. TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 16Focused on small and medium sized businesses, TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET) primarily provides human resources consultancy. This includes services around employee benefits, payroll, and risk mitigation services. TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET) also caters to taxation, healthcare, and retirement related services.

(NASDAQ:ADP), TriNet Group, Inc. (NYSE:TNET) is one of the best human resources stocks to invest in. 10. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) is a global provider of recruitment and hiring services. Be it Europe, Asia, or the Middle East, the company is engaged with all kinds of businesses to scout the best talent. ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) provides services regarding permanent and temporary employment. In addition, ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) also offers employee assessments, reviews and training. On May 5, the company declared an increase in dividend payments by 8.1% to $1.47 per share. ManpowerGroup reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 on July 20, missing Street estimates by $0.03. However, revenue for the period came in at $4.9 billion, beating market consensus by $40 million. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, a total of 19 hedge funds were bullish on ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN), as opposed to 20 in the last quarter of 2022. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $97.4 million. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about ManpowerGroup Inc. (NYSE:MAN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)9. Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Insperity, Inc.

In comparison to the last quarter of 2022, this number remains unchanged. Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Management holds the largest stake in the company, comprising 358,063 shares worth $43.5 million. Lakewood Capital Management had this to say about Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) in its Q2 2020 investor letter:“Earlier this year, the fund initiated a position in Insperity, a provider of outsourced human resources for small- and medium-sized businesses. We began purchasing shares in February as the stock declined significantly following disappointing earnings and guidance related to an unusual spike in employee benefit costs. Subsequent share price declines during the March stock market sell-off, primarily due to concerns about the health of the company’s core customer base, allowed us to purchase additional shares in a high-quality, growing and cash generative business at an extremely discounted valuation.Insperity operates what is called a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), whereby it serves as the co-employer for around 240,000 worksite employees (WSEs) across almost 9,000 companies. Insperity provides a wide range of human resources offerings to its clients and uses its position as a large “employer” to negotiate lower benefit pricing (including health insurance and workers’ compensation) than its clients would be able to obtain individually. This model has proven remarkably successful, with Insperity growing WSEs by 9% annually since 1999, while expanding gross profit and EBIT during the same period by 11% and 15% per annum, respectively. We believe there is a long runway for growth...” (Click here to see the full text)8. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) specializes in providing human resources solutions across the globe. With presence in America, Europe, and the Middle East, the company focuses on three major segments – Contract Talent Solutions, Permanent Placement Talent Solutions, and Protiviti. The first segment focuses on talent engagement in fields such as finance, technology, creative, and legal advisory. The second segment focuses on full-time employment for accounting, finance, taxation, and compliance professionals. Lastly, the Protiviti segment aims to provide business consulting services in finance, regulatory compliance, legal consultation, digital transformations, and internal audits. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is one of the best human resources stocks to buy. On July 25, Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) fell short of Wall Street estimates for Q2 revenue by $50 million and the EPS by $0.12. However, the company paid a $0.48 per share  dividend to shareholders in June 2023. Dividend payments for the quarter amounted to $51 million.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 21 hedge funds were bullish on Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI). Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management holds the largest position in Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI), with over 1.1 million shares valued at $89.9 million.FMI made the following comment about Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) is the market leader in professional staffing for small and medium sized businesses. The company has a premier temporary and permanent placement franchise in the field of accounting (Accountemps) and finance, while its Protiviti business has become a strong domestic and international consultancy. RHI’s reinvestment in technology, including its national database, candidate performance scoring, and proprietary AI and matching capabilities are driving share gains versus fragmented competition. The business model is asset-light and generates consistently strong returns-on-capital, industry leading margins, and free cash flow. The less cyclical Protiviti business accounts for 30% of income. Capital allocation at RHI has been focused on reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases. These factors should result in less overall cyclicality in EPS going forward. The shares are off 40% from its 2022 highs. We feel that the discounted valuation is reflective of current recession worries, which could lower demand for labor. Additionally, there are concerns around AI and the disruption that it could have on accounting. Our view is that the sentiment around the latter appears overdone, as demand for accountants has increased over time despite major advances in productivity tools.”7. Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY) is a global provider of consultancy services.

After exceeding expectations for more than a year, the company fell short in the most recent quarter as strong top line growth finally moderated. With economic conditions deteriorating around the world, investors may also anticipate additional deceleration.”6. Upwork Inc.

Upwork is a global employment marketplace that enables businesses to vet, hire, and manage talent as part of their distributed workforce. Upwork facilitates labor and demand side connectivity on a global scale by providing the infrastructure to create trust and to streamline talent sourcing, contracting, analysis and payment. Freelancers benefit from having a reputation ranking system that feeds their marketing channels, allowing them to have access to quality, flexible work and on time compensation. Businesses on the demand side benefit by having extensive access to specialized talent, enabling faster and more cost effective hiring, and by having the strategic optionality inherent in the ability to flex a portion of their workforce based on changing demand requirements.Labor markets have long had unnecessary frictional inefficiencies driven by regional talent imbalances and long-term trends of increased specialization of labor and declining labor mobility. Meanwhile, innovations in communication and global connectivity have transformed the way work gets done. Knowledge workers seek the flexibility and geographic advantages of on demand work, but the barrier to adoption…” (Click here to see the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Today.  Suggested articles:10 Best Growth Mutual Funds and Their Latest Top Picks12 Best Solar Energy and Battery Stocks To Buy Now10 Sustainable Investing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On Disclosure: None. 11 Best Human Resources Stocks To Buy Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

""The team met or exceeded our going-in plans for sales, earnings, and cash in a difficult operating environment and despite significant cost headwinds. As we look forward to fiscal 2024, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity – each in-line with our long-term growth algorithm, despite continued macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. We remain committed to our strategy – a focus on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority (of product, package, communication, go-to-market execution and value), productivity, constructive disruption, and an agile and accountable organization structure and culture – all in pursuit of sustainable, balanced growth and value creation.""Fiscal Year ($ billions, except EPS)GAAP20232022% ChangeNon-GAAP*20232022% ChangeNet Sales$82.0$80.22%Organic Salesn/an/a7%Diluted EPS$5.90$5.812%Core EPS$5.90$5.812%Fourth Quarter ($ billions, except EPS)GAAP20232022% ChangeNon-GAAP*20232022% ChangeNet Sales$20.6$19.55%Organic Salesn/an/a8%Diluted EPS$1.37$1.2113%Core EPS$1.37$1.2113%* Please refer to Exhibit 1 - Non-GAAP Measures for the definition and reconciliation of these measures to the related GAAP measures.Fiscal Year 2023 ResultsThe Company reported fiscal year 2023 net sales of $82.0 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased seven percent. The organic sales growth was due to a nine percent increase from higher pricing and a one percent increase from favorable mix, partially offset by a three percent decrease in shipment volumes.Story continuesDiluted net earnings per share were $5.90, an increase of two percent versus prior year. Currency-neutral net EPS increased 11% versus the prior year EPS.The Company generated operating cash flow of $16.8 billion and net earnings of $14.7 billion for the fiscal year. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%, which is calculated as operating cash flow less capital spending, as a percentage of net earnings. The Company returned over $16 billion of value to shareholders in fiscal 2023 via $9 billion in dividend payments and $7.4 billion of share repurchases. With the dividend increase in April 2023, this marks the 67th consecutive year that P&amp;G has increased its dividend and the 133rd consecutive year that P&amp;G has paid a dividend since its incorporation in 1890.April-June Quarter ResultsThe Company reported fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter net sales of $20.6 billion, an increase of five percent versus the prior year. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, increased eight percent. The organic sales growth was due to a seven percent increase from higher pricing and a two percent increase from favorable mix, partially offset by a one percent decrease in shipment volumes.Diluted net earnings per share were $1.37, an increase of 13% versus prior year.

Hair Care organic sales increased high single digits due primarily to increased pricing and positive product mix, partially offset by volume declines in Asia Pacific and Greater China. Skin and Personal Care organic sales increased low teens due to increased pricing, positive mix from the growth of the super-premium SK-II brand (versus a prior year period impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns) and volume growth from innovation.Grooming segment organic sales increased eight percent versus year ago primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by volume declines from increased pricing and trade disruptions in Europe.Health Care segment organic sales increased five percent for the quarter. Oral Care organic sales increased low single digits due to increased net pricing, mostly offset by lower volumes due to market contraction in Europe and higher pricing in North America. Personal Health Care organic sales increased double digits due to positive mix from the disproportionate growth of respiratory products and higher pricing, partially offset by volume declines due to market contraction in Asia Pacific.Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased eight percent for the quarter. Fabric Care organic sales increased mid-single digits driven primarily by higher net pricing and positive product mix, partially offset by lower volumes primarily in Greater China. Home Care organic sales increased double digits due to increased pricing and positive product mix, partially offset by market volume softness.Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased nine percent versus year ago. Baby Care organic sales increased high single digits due to increased pricing and positive product mix, partially offset by lower volumes from increased pricing. Feminine Care organic sales increased double digits led by increased net pricing and positive product mix, partially offset by a volume decline. Family Care organic sales increased double digits due to volume growth and increased pricing.Diluted net earnings per share were $1.37 for the quarter, an increase of 13% versus the prior year. This was driven by an increase in net sales, an increase in operating margin and a reduction in shares outstanding. Currency-neutral net EPS increased 22% versus the prior year.Gross margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points versus year ago, 450 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 340 basis points of pricing benefit and 290 basis points of productivity savings. These were partially offset by 110 basis points of contract material price increases net of a modest reduction in commodities, 20 basis points of product and package reinvestments and 50 basis points of negative product mix and other impacts.Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) as a percentage of sales increased 190 basis points versus the prior year, 140 basis points on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was driven by 470 basis points of marketing and overhead investments, largely offset by 190 basis points of leverage benefit due to increased sales and 140 basis points of overhead savings and marketing efficiencies.Operating margin for the quarter increased 190 basis points versus the prior year, 310 basis points on a currency-neutral basis.Fiscal Year 2024 GuidanceP&amp;G expects fiscal year 2024 all-in sales growth in the range of three to four percent versus the prior year. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately one percentage point to all-in sales growth. The Company expects organic sales growth in the range of four to five percent.P&amp;G expects fiscal 2024 diluted net earnings per share growth in the range of six to nine percent versus fiscal 2023 EPS of $5.90. This outlook equates to a range of $6.25 to $6.43 per share, with a mid-point estimate of $6.34, or an increase of 7.5%.The Company said its current outlook estimates a net benefit of around $400 million after-tax from favorable commodity costs net of unfavorable foreign exchange.The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures without unreasonable efforts given the unpredictability of the timing and amounts of discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or impairments, which could significantly impact GAAP results.P&amp;G said it expects a core effective tax rate to be approximately 20% in fiscal 2024.Capital spending is estimated to be approximately five percent of fiscal 2024 net sales.P&amp;G is targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% and expects to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 to $6 billion of common shares in fiscal 2024.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this release, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Gamble CompanyExhibit 1: Non-GAAP MeasuresThe following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter &amp; Gamble's July 28, 2023, earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow and tax rate measures because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results.Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.Currency-neutral operating margin: Currency-neutral operating margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.Currency-neutral gross margin: Currency-neutral gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.Currency-neutral selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense as a percentage of net sales: Currency-neutral SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of net sales is a measure of the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company's operating efficiency over time.Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per common share excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted EPS.Currency-neutral EPS: Currency-neutral EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 (the ""U.S. Tax Act""). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.

491,99c47cd9-a289-31dc-a83e-1de04af3b468,PG,2023-07-28,13 Safe Stocks To Invest In,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-safe-stocks-invest-050937380.html,1690520977,STORY,"['MRK', 'HD', 'JNJ', 'KO', 'PEP', 'HSY', 'PG', 'WMT', 'AMZN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 13 safe stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ are discussed in the safe harbor statement in our earnings press release and in greater detail within the risk factors in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Our past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future performance, and investors should not use historical results to anticipate future results or trends.

MillerThank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. 4 years ago, the leadership team set this organization on a path focused on 5 key business priorities, which include: Quality of revenue; operational efficiency, modernization and innovation; ERP implementation; portfolio optimization and debt reduction and leverage improvement. These priorities have been our true North Star through unanticipated macroeconomic and pandemic-related headwinds. Today, I'm excited to share that we have achieved our targeted debt leverage ratio of below 3x, ending the second quarter at 2.7x, our lowest leverage since 2015. This is a major milestone and reflects our consistent focus on financial discipline. The strengthening of our balance sheet and debt leverage puts us in a position to optimize our debt structure and will afford us greater investment flexibility in the future. This quarter, we also made important progress executing on our portfolio optimization initiative as we completed the divestiture of our operations in 4 countries: Brazil, Australia, Singapore and Korea for combined net proceeds of approximately $84 million. Brazil and Korea were regulated waste and compliance services businesses and Singapore and Australia were Secure Information Destruction businesses. Additionally, earlier this week, we divested our dental recycling business in the Netherlands, and we expect to close on the sale of our Secure Information Destruction business in the United Arab Emirates in the third quarter. Turning to our second quarter results. We delivered our 10th consecutive quarter of overall organic revenue growth, growing 2.3% with regulated waste and compliance services increasing 4.7%, partially offset by Secure Information Destruction organic revenue declining 2.1% as a result of lower indexed fuel and environmental surcharges. In North America, we are encouraged by positive trends in the market with the stabilization of hospital staffing levels and the return of elective surgeries. Internationally, we have not observed similar improving trends, but we stand at the ready to support our customers. Our infrastructure modernization efforts, including existing and additional future treatment capacity in strategically placed geographic areas will allow us to support growth in our customer base. Turning to our operational efficiency, modernization and innovation priority, our multiphase journey to construct, test and ramp up processing of regulated medical waste in the McCarran, Nevada incinerator continues to progress through the construction phase. Based on our current time line, we expect the construction phase of the project to be completed in the first half of 2024, subject to successfully achieving critical milestones, equipment deliveries and passing quality inspections. After construction is complete, we will move into the testing phase, which includes regulatory review. Once testing is successfully completed, we will be able to ramp up the processing of waste and eventually move into full production. In addition to McCarran, we have 20 other infrastructure projects underway, including several autoclave and incinerator improvement projects with many of these upgrade projects expected to be finalized in the third quarter of 2023. Like many logistics companies, we are experiencing higher fleet costs, including repairs, maintenance and vehicle return fees. We expect to continue to manage these higher costs through other savings and productivity opportunities, such as our fleet modernization initiatives. At quarter end, we had received almost 80% of our outstanding fleet orders, and we anticipate receiving the remaining vehicles by late summer. Fleet modernization helps drive fuel savings and driver productivity. Moving to the ERP. We expect to deploy U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services on the platform in the third quarter, subject to successfully achieving the remaining go/no-go decision point. Over the next several weeks, approximately 5,000 team members will be involved in preparing for and launching the system. As I turn the call over to Janet to review our financial results, I'm pleased to share that our first half financial performance came in line with our full year guidance, as she will explain.Janet H. ZelenkaThank you, Cindy. I will start by summarizing our second quarter results. As noted on Slide 5, revenues in the second quarter were $669.5 million compared to $679.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the net impact of divestitures of $24 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $1.2 million, organic revenues increased $14.9 million. Of this increase, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services' organic revenue growth was $19.7 million, while Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $4.8 million. As noted on Slide 6, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services' revenues were $444.7 million compared to $448.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange rates, organic revenues increased 4.7% in the second quarter. In North America, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services' organic revenues increased $16.8 million or 4.8%, mainly driven by our 3 pricing levers, which include pricing in existing contracts, new customer pricing and surcharges and fees. We are also pleased with the year-over-year positive growth in core medical waste collected, which contributed to roughly 1/3 of the organic revenue growth. International Regulated Waste and Compliance Services' organic revenues increased $2.9 million or 3.9%, mainly driven by our pricing levers, partially offset by lower waste volumes compared to the second quarter of 2022. International waste volumes have been impacted by hospital and nursing staffing shortages and intermittent strikes throughout Europe. In the case of the United Kingdom, it was recently reported that the NHS' medical procedures backlog has increased over 200% since 2020 to more than 7.4 million patients needing medical procedures. Secure Information Destruction revenues were $224.8 million compared to $231.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, organic revenues decreased 2.1%. In North America, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues declined $3.3 million or 1.6% compared to the second quarter of 2022, mainly due to the decline in fuel surcharges. In the second quarter, recycling paper revenues were down approximately 4% or $8.1 million due to lower SOP, paper pricing and lower tonnage. The lower SOP recycling revenue was mostly offset by our recycling recovery surcharge, mainly due to the change in the rate table beginning in June 2022. Service revenue was up approximately 2.4% or $4.9 million, mainly driven by pricing levers, which includes the expansion of the recycling recovery surcharge. As a reminder, we have been working to add SOP surcharges to customer service contracts as we continue to renew contracts and win new business. These surcharges are now included in approximately 60% of North America customer contracts and are anticipated to offset approximately 60% of paper price volatility at current review rate. Our service revenue growth was partially offset by lower index fuel and environmental surcharges, which have declined as fuel prices have come down year-over-year. In International, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues decreased $1.5 million or 5.4% compared to the second quarter of 2022, mainly due to lower recycling revenue and fuel and environmental surcharges. Loss from operations in the second quarter was $24 million compared to income from operations of $38.1 million in the second quarter of 2022. The $62.1 million decrease was mainly due to 2023 net divestiture losses of $54.2 million, higher incentive and stock-based compensation of $9.7 million and higher fleet costs of $4.9 million, partially offset by lower bad debt expense of $8.9 million. Although we saw a decline in fuel costs, it roughly mirrored the decline in fuel and environmental surcharges. Net loss was $49.5 million or $0.54 diluted loss per share compared to net income of $10.5 million or $0.11 diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2022. The $60 million decrease was mainly due to lower income from operations of $62.1 million, as I just explained. Cash flow from operations for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, was an inflow of $154.9 million compared to an outflow of $18.4 million in the same period of 2022. The year-over-year increase of $173.3 million was mainly driven by lower FCPA settlement payments of $67.6 million; accounts receivable improvements of $52.1 million, mainly due to an improvement in days sales outstanding; higher cash generated from operating income of $23.3 million; lower annual incentive compensation payments of $22.3 million; and other working capital improvements of $8 million. Adjusted income from operations was $76 million or 11.4% as a percentage of revenues, down from $82 million or 12.1% as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted income from operations decreased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenues due to the following: one, higher incentive and stock-based compensation of 150 basis points; and two, higher fleet costs of 70 basis points. These were partially offset by lower bad debt expense of 130 basis points. As noted on Slide 8, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.43 compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact from divestitures and foreign exchange rates of $0.01, the remaining $0.04 year-over-year decline was driven by: one, higher incentive and stock-based compensation of $0.08. As noted on the fourth quarter 2022 earnings call, we expected to incur higher year-over-year costs in this area, which began in the second quarter; and, two, higher fleet costs of $0.04. These were partially offset by lower bad debt expense of $0.07 and lower tax expense of $0.01. Capital expenditures for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, were $63.7 million compared to $70 million for the same period last year. Free cash flow for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, was an inflow of $91.2 million compared to an outflow of $88.4 million in the same period of 2022. As noted on Slide 9, the year-over-year improvement of $179.6 million was mainly due to higher cash flow from operations of $173.3 million. Our second quarter DSO, as reported, was 55 days compared to a DSO of 64 days in the second quarter of 2022. The difference was mainly driven by the timing of North America Secure Information Destruction customer billing and collections in the prior year. As shown on Slide 10, at the end of the second quarter, our credit agreement-defined debt leverage ratio was 2.7x. Additionally, we reduced our net debt by $174.4 million in the second quarter to approximately $1.28 billion. As Cindy noted, we divested our Brazil, Republic of Korea, Australia and Singapore businesses for net proceeds of approximately $84 million. These proceeds were used to pay down our term loan by $50 million, with the remainder applied to our revolver. These divested entities contributed approximately $56 million in revenue in 2022 and approximately $20 million in revenue prior to divestiture in 2023. On Slide 11, we have removed the divested revenue from our 2022 baseline revenue. The divestitures generated a nominal amount of adjusted EBITDA in 2022, and we're expected to contribute approximately $5 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, with a planned improvement in the second half of 2023. The majority of the anticipated $5 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA is expected to be offset by lower interest expense to using divestiture proceeds to pay down debt. Additionally, as of June 30, we approved plans to divest our dental recycling business in the Netherlands, which was sold earlier this week and our Secure Information Destruction joint ventures in the United Arab Emirates, which is expected to close in the third quarter, resulting in a second quarter pretax charges of $1.5 million. The dental recycling business contributed approximately $2 million in revenue in 2022 and nominal adjusted EBITDA while the joint venture is accounted for as an equity investment. Our results for the first 6 months of the year were aligned with our full year 2023 guidance, as shown on Slide 11. Our guidance ranges remain the same. As we look to complete construction on the new incinerator in Nevada, which is about 1/3 of our planned 2024 capital expenditures, we may pull forward cash outlays from 2024 into the fourth quarter of 2023 based on timing of equipment deliveries. If this occurs, we anticipate that it would put us in the higher end of our 2023 capital expenditure guidance range of $125 million to $145 million, which we anticipate would have a minimal impact on overall free cash flow due to projected working capital improvements. Regarding our free cash flow guidance, it excludes other adjusted litigation items, which we anticipate may be paid in the third and fourth quarters. If paid this year, they would reduce free cash flow by approximately $25 million to $30 million. I will now turn the call back to Cindy.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Janet. The second quarter continues to highlight the strength of our team's ability to execute against our key business priorities while maintaining our ability to achieve our full year guidance. Our team is excited to build on our momentum of our key business priorities as we look forward to the deployment of the ERP to our U.S. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services business in the third quarter. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, team members and the communities we serve and our shareholders for their continued trust in having Stericycle protect what matters.Operator, please open the line for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today goes to Sean Dodge of RBC Capital Markets.Sean Wilfred DodgeYes. And congratulations on the great progress with the leverage ratio. I want to start on the ERP, Cindy. Yes, you said you expect to have the U.S. Regulated Waste Systems all transitioned over by, it sounds like September. If we think about the potential for disruption to the business from this, if all this goes well, by the time we get to October, are the big risks with that pretty much behind you at that point?Cindy J. MillerYes. I think it's very insightful, Sean. A couple of things that we will have when we get ready to share an update in October, we will have gone through a billing cycle or more. We'll be able to do some comparisons to make sure that we're on track in terms of trends and any of the data that we can analyze. So I think those are very big ones. And then I think after that, you still have the nuances of, do all the -- how is it going with all the handheld (inaudible) operations? And how are all the scales transmitting all the material and the data that we need to keep track of for regulatory and compliance reasons? So there's a myriad of things. I just mentioned 2 kind of very simple buckets. But I think we're going to get a really good feel because what you talked about was disruption. And in terms of disruption, automatically, we're going to look at making sure: Number one, are we servicing customers when we should be; our customers taken care of; and then number three, is the revenue flowing through? And are we seeing it in terms of our billing process. So I think that Q3 report, we'll be able to give some pretty good insight.Sean Wilfred DodgeOkay. Great. And then on the margins and all the pricing actions you all have taken over the last couple of years with the service recovery fee, the shifting of the SOP table, are those all now fully reflected in what we're seeing here in Q2? Or are there more levers you pull in or some leg benefits still out there from the -- I guess as we think about margins into the back half of the year, is there any more lift you expect to get from these pricing actions on a sequential basis?Cindy J. MillerI think the lift that we've gotten is pretty much at steady state. I think we would look to provide additional lift if we saw conditions worsen, if anything else had happened. I think we are seeing some relief in portions of the business where costs are becoming more, I want to say, normalized. However, as we called out in an area like fleet, we are still seeing cost pressures being up with reference to maintenance, vehicle repairs. When we return any of our rental vehicles, the fees for returning some of those vehicles have been increased quite a bit. So for us, I think we stay pretty close to it. I don't foresee anything else that would be added in terms of any changes. However, all of those are dictated by what we see in the marketplace, and I know Fed just raised yesterday. So we'll see if that drives anything else. Just as a latest update, Sean, just so you know, the last time we changed the scarf fee, the regulated waste fee was in October of last year. And then the last adjustment that we've made on the recycling surcharge was March of this year, just as a reference point for moving forward, but I don't see anything else at this time.OperatorAnd the next question goes to David Manthey of Baird.David John MantheyYes. Thank you. Good morning. First question related to the question that was just asked, after the inefficiencies that you experienced with the SID ERP rollout, have you factored in any type of disruption or any efficiencies or anything in RWCS in the current 2023 guidance that you've given us?Janet H. ZelenkaYes. David, the guidance that we put out for the year reflected that we were going to go through this. And so that meant that we weren't going to be able to drive significant productivity improvements in the second half of the year as -- in the RWCS space as they will actually be taken off for training, they're actually doing that now, and that will ramp up in this quarter for the go live. Secure Information Destruction will continue to drive operational efficiencies, but that will be offset by what we plan for just this productivity, if you will, from putting an ERP in. And I think you can see that our guidance and outlook for the year is pretty reasonable, and that is reflected in the sales growth as well. So the short answer is yes, we plan for some of that.David John MantheyOkay. And then, Janet, further, based on the free cash flow guidance you've given us in the past and you've sort of given us some thoughts around the magnitude of operating margin improvement that you ultimately might expect in the business, can you give us an idea of what you might be thinking about in year 1 after this? You come out the other side? And again, based on the opportunity that you see out there, BlueSky in addition to the experience that you had and sort of the cadence of improvement coming out of the SID improvement trajectory after you implemented the ERP there. Any thoughts you can give us on that?Janet H. ZelenkaSo we still remain committed to our long-term guidance, which included the 13% to 17% adjusted improvement that we -- that is reflected in improved margin improvement. And what will happen is Secure Information Destruction continues we'll get some momentum into next year as they continue to find opportunities through using the platform to generate productivity improvements from fleet to route to idle time to all the measures that we can see while RWCS will learn the platform and then it will start probably towards the second half of the year to be able to leverage it. So the advantage of sequencing the 2 businesses is one can keep moving and driving on the improvements while the other is taking on the new work and learning it and then can move into driving improvement.OperatorOur next question goes to Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerI'll echo the congratulations on reducing the financial leverage. You mentioned, I think it was Netherlands and United Emirates divestitures in the quarter. Could you just give us an update on where you are on the portfolio optimization process. It seems like you're announcing a few weeks each quarter now. They don't sound too material in size, but I'm just curious how much more meaningful proceeds perhaps can be derived there?Cindy J. MillerYes. Scott, great question. Portfolio optimization remains one of our key priorities. I'm -- I think we've got about 17 -- well, the dental business will be 18 divestitures in the last little bit. The joint venture in the UAE will be, if you will, 19, although certainly different than the others because it's a joint venture. But in essence, kind of pulling out of business, pulling out of operations. But along that same time period, we've had an acquisition, too. So for us, I think if you take a look at the discipline that we've had fiscally in terms of improving the balance sheet, if you take a look at the position that we're in, in terms of overall debt, I think portfolio optimization for us continues to be looking at markets where we believe we have the opportunity to grow at the margins that we believe a company of our size and the value that we can bring would be meaningful. So I think the long answer that I gave you is really, in portfolio optimization, we continue to look from a divestiture perspective as well as a potential acquisition perspective as we've done before and we'll see where that leads.OperatorAnd the next question goes to Tobey Sommer of Truist Securities.Jack WilsonThis is Jack Wilson on for Tobey Summer. Can you give me a little more color around sort of the organic revenue decline in Secure Information Destruction?Cindy J. MillerSure. I think one of the things that I think we need to really take a look at is I like to look at Secure Information more in terms of first half of the year versus last year, first half of the year, simply because things, I think, have the potential to get skewed. Last year, first half, it was early 2022, record inflation, driver shortages, supply chain issues, and we were still dealing, believe it or not, with Omicron with 14-day quarantines if anybody was exposed to anybody that had COVID. And if you recall, Q1 of last year was probably one of the most difficult operating quarters we've ever had. And when you take a transactional business that says you only get paid if you actually make a stop, you've got some difficulties there when you're already in a driver shortage to begin with, and then you have a lot of drivers out based off of different CDC rules. So as a result, Q1 of this year, Shred saw -- our Secure Information Destruction business in North America grew 13.4% over the prior year. So as you can see, that was a pretty big number. What ended up happening and what we believe is we then accelerated, started to get drivers back, put drivers in seats, had ramp-up time to get drivers ready to go, and we made up for an awful lot of those stops in Q2 of last year. So what we're seeing right now is the overall comparison this quarter versus last quarter. We are showing in North America a decline -- a modest decline of 1.6% and -- but I think it's just coming off of that comparison. So our ability to reaffirm guidance this year believes that the fundamentals of what we're seeing in the Shred business still continues to be what we think is good. So for us, it's not a quarter story. We're continuing to monitor the overall business, and we like the position that we're in.Janet H. ZelenkaI just would add that we also have the dynamic of a fuel surcharge that is mostly in the shredded business. And as fuel costs came down, it worked as it should in that index came down at revenue, but costs came down in the core business as well and our cost of revenue. So it sort of did what it was supposed to do at the EBIT level, and we're still okay. So that's a top line dynamic that doesn't filter down to the bottom line.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question goes to you Brian Butler of Stifel. Brian.Brian Joseph ButlerFirst question, just on the Secure Information Destruction business, did the stops increase? And are you seeing a meaningful shift between on-site shred versus off-site?Cindy J. MillerYes. I think on-site versus off-site, we've been making steady progress. And I think it's pretty much been not as -- we made more progress earlier than where we are right now in terms of -- when we purchased the business back in 2015, there was a tremendous amount of shredding on a customer site, which is very difficult, specialized vehicles, a lot of vehicle issues, high maintenance with not as much being brought back to facilities. Over the course of the last several years, there's been a marked effort to now -- the majority of the volume that we pick up is processed back in our facility as opposed to with the specialized vehicles on site. So for me, I think we're in a really good position there. We constantly look to improve that. But I think that's a real good dynamic for us. And in reference, in terms of SOPs, just remember, we continue to win new business, we continue to drive our sales efforts in that space. And I think, unfortunately, we've got 2 quarters with different dynamics in a transactional business for some odd comparisons. But I think overall, we take a look internally at where we are for stops. And I think in terms of how we are trending towards our plan and how that plan fits into our 3% to 5% growth -- organic revenue growth for the company, we're reaffirming guidance which means we believe we're on track.Brian Joseph ButlerOkay. And then shifting back to the ERP. Can you remind us what the duplicative IT costs are? Is there any more cost to be eliminated once the ERP is fully rolled out? And how does that, I guess, flow through the business over the next -- whether that be 6 or 12 months?Janet H. ZelenkaYes, you're right. We are maintaining and we put into full operation, which was about $50 million to $60 million of costs that slipped into our normal operating expenses in August of 2021 for the new system, while maintaining the legacy system of which RWCS is on globally. And that costs around $20 million to $30 million of legacy costs in IT and some other related areas. That is the cost that has the opportunity to go away once we're fully deployed, but we also need to modernize international before we can achieve that. So we're well on our path for that, and we have started to work on the international space, but it needs to come off globally before we can really turn that legacy system over. And that is factored into our long-term guidance as we thought through on the savings that we will achieve on IT costs.OperatorAnd we have a follow-up question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerCindy, with fleet cost being an issue here, and I wanted to hone in on the use of rentals a little bit. What percent of vehicles are you -- it sounds like you're fleeting up a bit and fleet modernizing, but use of rentals, where are you now as maybe a percent of your fleet and usage on a given day. And where are you looking to take that as a goal?Cindy J. MillerYes. That's pretty keen, a good insight, Scott. So for us, we've had -- we've been in the rental business. I think most of last year -- second half of last year, we talked an awful lot about the supply chain being far behind and the actual receiving of our vehicle requests really being delayed. So as a result, you want to continue, you continue to grow, you continue to see organic growth, you've got to be able to service your customers. And rentals not just of tractors, but then also trailers, you've got a rent in order for that growth in terms of your ability to hold on to your trailers and a lot of the other power units. So since the beginning of this year, we've really been modeling an opportunity as vehicles and the fleet orders have started to come in. We've been, this year, going on some pretty massive vehicle returns, so returning those rentals that we have. And what we have seen are some pretty high -- some pretty exponentially high return costs for each vehicle. It used to be a set amount that was quite reasonable. And in some instances, we've seen it be 200% more in terms of an increase. So as you return more, which is a good thing because you're going to get a new vehicle order come in, you're going to have a vehicle that's more modernized and it's better equipped and designed for the job that our frontline drivers do. However, you do take a hit in terms of the rental. So your question is how many do we have? I can tell you, by the end of summer, we're estimating to have 80% of our fleet order completed. Now that's a much better position than we've been in quite some time. We've had -- we've been waiting on quite a few vehicles. So for us, I think we're winding down the last bit of our rental returns on the trailers as well as on the power equipment. But I think the overall fleet strategy, Sean, I think -- or I'm sorry, Scott, the overall strategy that we have is we eventually want to even get out of the leasing business because right now, we've talked before about our fleet strategy has been leasing. I think a longer-term push for us will be to a point where we continue to be fiscally responsible, have some strength in our balance sheet. We're looking for reasons to invest as we continue to generate cash. I think our long-term momentum to be able to start to buy some of the fleet and buy the trailers so that we can really take advantage of that on our balance sheet. I think that's the future of where we'd like to get to.OperatorAnd we have a follow-up from Jack Wilson of Truist Securities.Jack WilsonSo could you just maybe walk through a little bit of the moving parts of achieving full year EPS guidance with sort of the ERP system and the new fleet dynamics?Janet H. ZelenkaSo we have a fairly stable year. But if you look at where we delivered the first half, it kind of is in line with the first half guidance. If you split the guidance in 2, in the second half is kind of in the same boat. The -- you'll probably see some uptick in the fourth quarter just as we get through the ERP and we continue to drive productivity in shred, but -- we are going into an ERP. So the precision of being able to do a quarterly precision on what's going to happen is a little tougher, but we're really confident in the second year and the guidance for the full year that we put out.OperatorWe have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Cindy for any closing comments.Cindy J. MillerThank you, Nadia. So for everyone listening to the call, I just want to share that we -- as always, we appreciate your interest in Stericycle and your shared excitement in our future. So thank you very much. We'll talk to you all soon.OperatorThank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

504,d6dfc3e8-bdb3-3a27-96b4-58737f1df40f,ORLY,2023-07-28,Here's Why We Think O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-oreilly-automotive-102130134.html,1690539690,STORY,['ORLY'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for O'Reilly Automotive O'Reilly Automotive's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that O'Reilly Automotive's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note O'Reilly Automotive achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to US$15b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of O'Reilly Automotive's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre O'Reilly Automotive Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$56b company like O'Reilly Automotive. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$568m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to O'Reilly Automotive, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.O'Reilly Automotive's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$5.5m in the year prior to December 2022. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add O'Reilly Automotive To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that O'Reilly Automotive has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that O'Reilly Automotive is worth keeping an eye on. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for O'Reilly Automotive (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.Jeremy Adam FletcherThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our second quarter 2023 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.Before we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements. And we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.At this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.Story continuesGregory D. JohnsonThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are our Co-Presidents, Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby; as well as Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.I'd like to begin our call today thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to consistently providing excellent service to our customers. Our team's proven ability to execute our business strategy at a high level drove our second quarter comparable store sales increase of 9%, exceeding our expectations on both the professional and DIY sides of our business.For the first 6 months of 2023, we generated a 9.8% increase in comparable store sales, which is the direct result of our team's unrelenting focus on providing the best customer service in our industry. Our team members and our culture remain our greatest assets. I made the exact same statement on our first quarter call, but it warrants repeating.Our commitment to strengthening our culture and investing in our team is paying clear dividends in our continued strong performance. And I want to congratulate all of Team O'Reilly on another outstanding job in the second quarter.Driven by the strength of our top line performance, we're also pleased to deliver a robust 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Our operating cost spend was elevated above our expectations, which Brad will discuss more -- in more detail during his prepared comments, but we remain pleased with the investments we have made in our business to build on the momentum our teams are generating.Our EPS results reflect our ability to produce strong, compounding operating profit dollar growth, and we are committed to aggressively capitalizing on the opportunities we see to provide enhanced value for our customers and earn even greater market share.As a result of our strong top line performance, we are increasing our full year 2023 EPS guidance to a range of $37.05 to $37.55, reflecting our second quarter results and shares repurchased since our last call. At the midpoint of this revised range, we now expect our full year EPS to increase 12% over 2022.As we disclosed in our press releases last night, after 41 years of service to our company, I've made the decision to retire next January. At that time, Brad Beckham will take over my role as Chief Executive Officer with direct responsibility to the Board as the leader of our executive team. We will also be promoting Brent Kirby to the role of company President. As you know, Brad and Brent assumed the roles of Co-President earlier in the year, and they have both taken on increasing levels of responsibility and prominence in the leadership of our business over the past several years.Succession planning has always been a very important and methodical process at our company. In many ways, our upcoming change mirrors the successful leadership transitions we have seen before in our company's history, including when Jeff Shaw and I were elevated to lead the company in 2018 and Greg Henslee and Ted Wise were selected as the first non-O'Reilly family members in the top leadership roles of CEO and COO in 2005. Brad and Brent are both extremely talented and experienced individuals who have the full support of our team, and I have every confidence they will continue to deliver on our company's long-term track record of success. Over the period of now -- from now through January 31, we will complete the transition of the day-to-day operations of the company to Brad and Brent.Finally, Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, will also be continuing in their roles and along with our full Board will support Brad, Brent and our executive team in executing our strategy and driving long-term value for our shareholders.As I finish up in my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for continuing to provide industry-leading customer service every day and generating excellent results in the first half of 2023. I'm extremely proud of all of you, and I'm excited to keep the momentum strong in the back half of the year.I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?Brad W. BeckhamThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another excellent performance in the second quarter. Our continued industry-leading sales performance is the direct result of our team's unwavering commitment to our company's culture of providing excellent customer service, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication.Over the last several quarters, our team has generated tremendous momentum in our business, and that strength carried into the second quarter, driving our outstanding top line sales performance. As we've discussed on our last quarter's conference call, we faced some pressure from the timing of spring weather at the end of the first quarter, but our business rebounded with the onset of normal spring weather in April.Those strong sales trends continued throughout the quarter, resulting in our outperformance versus our expectations in each month of the quarter. From a cadence perspective, our results were very steady in each month of the quarter both in absolute terms and as compared to our expectations.The ability of our team to drive high levels of sustained sales growth month after month is the product of consistent daily execution of our key business fundamentals. And I couldn't be more pleased with how consistently Team O'Reilly has performed in the first half of 2023.Now I would like to provide additional details on our sales performance in professional and DIY. Our professional business was again the outperformer in the second quarter. Our team delivered a mid-teens comparable store sales increase in our professional business in the quarter with incredibly strong growth coming on top of double-digit professional comps in the second quarter of 2022.The compounded gains we are seeing on this side of our business reflect a sustained high level of customer service and execution that has allowed us to translate increased sales gains into future business opportunities. Every chance we have with a professional customer to prove our exceptional value gives us the ability to earn the next call and capture even more of that customer's business.As we have seen our business grow over the last few years, our store teams have made the most of these incremental opportunities, and we continue to see runway to leverage our proven business model and execution to gain market share.Turning to DIY. We continue to be reasonably pleased with this side of our business with our teams delivering steady comparable store sales growth, consistent with our overall trends in the first quarter. As we move past the spring weather volatility we experienced at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, our DIY business has been very steady with consistently positive performance in each month of the quarter.Our comparable store sales increase in our DIY business was driven by increased average ticket values aided by same SKU inflation, but we were also pleased to see flat DIY ticket count comps in the second quarter. Average ticket growth was in the mid-single digits on a combined basis for both sides of our business and drove the larger share of our comparable store sales increase. However, strength in ticket count comps, especially in our professional business, was the larger contributor to our outperformance versus our expectations.Our average ticket growth was driven primarily by same-SKU inflation, which was in line with our expectations, coupled with a modest benefit from product mix and complexity in our professional business. As anticipated, same-SKU inflation we realized in the second quarter ticked down from the tailwind we saw in the first quarter. We continue to expect to see this benefit moderate in the back half of 2023 as we lap impact of 2022 price increases. This dynamic was built into our initial guidance expectations and remains unchanged.To wrap up my comments on sales, I would like to highlight our updated sales guidance and full year outlook. From a macro perspective, we continue to remain bullish on the strength of our industry and prospects for the remainder of 2023. Our customer base has continued to be very resilient and willing to prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles in order to avoid taking on a payment for newer, more costly vehicles.While we still maintain an element of caution with regard to the outlook for the overall U.S. economy and the potential for heightened economic pressures, we believe that current market dynamics combine to provide a strong backdrop for demand in our industry.In light of this backdrop, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 5% to 7% from our previous range of 4% to 6% with a corresponding increase in total sales guidance to $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion. This increase reflects our year-to-date performance through today's call. As I've already discussed, we anticipate moderation in our comparable store sales expectations in the back half of the year as we realize less built-in benefit from same SKU increases.Our expectations also incorporate more challenging ticket count comparisons as we move through the back half of the year. The combined impact of both of these factors is driving the anticipated deceleration in our comparable store sales guidance in the second half of 2023 versus the 9.8% increase we generated in the first 6 months of 2023. However, our teams remain highly motivated to take share in every market, and we remain diligent in delivering a high level of customer service to accelerate our sales momentum.Before I move on from sales, I will add that we are pleased to be off to a strong start in the third quarter as we have seen the robust sales trends in the first half of the year continue with incremental strength from the extreme heat in many of our markets in the first few weeks of July.Now I would like to discuss our second quarter SG&amp;A results, which came in higher than our original expectations for the quarter and were above the long-term growth rate necessary to operate our business model. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was 30.3%, a deleverage of 71 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. This deleverage was driven by an increase in SG&amp;A per store of approximately 10%. This heightened level of SG&amp;A was incorporated in part into our initial expectations for 2023 but ultimately came in higher than anticipated driven by a few key factors I will briefly recap.Coming into 2023, we identified several key initiatives targeted to enhance our long-term operational strength with an intent to capitalize on the considerable momentum we have generated in our business to further separate ourselves from the competition and consolidate the market. We have been pleased with the progress of these initiatives and in a few instances, realized an opportunity to accelerate these investments in the second quarter.A good example relates to our plans this year to increase our spend on refreshing the image and appearance of our stores, which is targeted at both strategic projects as well as improved general maintenance of our existing facilities. We have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic. We have been -- excuse me, as we have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic, we have been working hard to catch up on deferred maintenance needs of our stores that have unfortunately accumulated over the last couple of years.As a result, part of our SG&amp;A pressure in the second quarter was driven by going faster than originally planned to address this issue. The image, appearance and shoppability of our stores is incredibly important to our ability to drive DIY traffic, customer satisfaction and in turn share gains over time. We have also seen good traction in our efforts to enhance our team member experience and benefits.Our initiatives here have reaped better-than-expected team member retention but have also contributed to the overall cost of these enhancements, which coupled with the deferred compensation SG&amp;A headwind Jeremy will discuss in a moment, added to our SG&amp;A growth in the quarter.Outside of these deliberate decisions to enhance our business, we unfortunately also faced pressure during the quarter from a higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure driven by inflation and claim costs. Ultimately, we remain -- we retain control of our most significant driver of our total SG&amp;A spend and the decisions we make around store payroll and appropriate staffing levels within our stores. Ensuring we have the strongest possible team delivering the best customer service in the industry is one of the most important, if not the most important driver of our long-term success.Our total payroll spend in the second quarter was another contributor to the higher-than-normal SG&amp;A per store increase driven by total head count and staffing levels, coupled with higher incentive compensation with wage rates largely in line with our expectations. As we have discussed often in the past, we manage this key component of our SG&amp;A spend with a long-term focus. As we have continued to see our business accelerate over the last year-plus since exiting the pandemic, we have prioritized ensuring that our stores are delivering a high level of service on both sides of our business.When we gain share with new and existing customers as we have seen over the last 2 years, we create an opportunity to prove our industry-leading value proposition as a trusted supplier and in turn earn repeat expanded business. In these situations, we are judicious about how we manage staffing levels to ensure we are delivering the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships.As we look forward to the balance of the year, we now expect to see an SG&amp;A per store increase of approximately 6%, which reflects our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Implicit in this guidance is our expectation that per store SG&amp;A growth will moderate versus what we have seen in the first half of 2023 even as we continue to pursue strategic initiatives in our business.We remain highly committed to expense control as a culture value and have set high expectations for the long-term productivity of the investments we're making today. We have a long track record of diligently managing our expenses to match the business conditions we are seeing in our markets, and we will continue to prudently adjust our operating cost structure to drive long-term value in our business. Finally, we still continue to expect our full year operating profit margin to come in within the range of 19.8% to 20.3% of sales.Before I turn the call over to Brent, I would like to thank our entire team for their unwavering hard work and commitment so far in 2023. I am extremely humbled to have the opportunity to service our next -- our company's next Chief Executive Officer. And I couldn't be more excited to work side by side with our over 88,000 dedicated parts -- professional parts people to provide the best service possible to our customers and in turn drive outstanding performance for years to come.Now I'll turn the call over to Brent.Brent G. KirbyThanks, Brad. And I would like to join Greg and Brad in congratulating Team O'Reilly on the strength of our performance in the second quarter. Our strong top line sales performance and continued ability to outperform the market and gain share is a direct result of our team's relentless commitment to providing excellent customer service. And I want to thank all of our team members for their dedication to our company and to our customers.Now, I will walk through our second quarter gross margin results, what we are seeing in the competitive environment and discuss our investments in inventory, exciting developments in our store and distribution growth and capital expenditures.Beginning with gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin of 51.3% was down just 6 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and at the top end of our expectations. Our second quarter of 2023 represents the first quarter after we have fully lapped the rollout of our professional pricing initiative and atypical LIFO impacts, which provides us a much clearer read on a year-over-year gross margin performance, excluding the noise that these factors have caused in prior quarters.We are pleased with the stability of our gross profit results, especially in light of the pressure we continue to face from the extremely strong performance of our professional business. As this side of our business has continued to outperform, we have faced mix headwinds to gross margin but have been able to offset this pressure with incremental improvements in acquisition cost, solid leverage of distribution expenses and positive shrink results.I would also like to provide some color on the cost and pricing dynamics we are seeing in our industry, both on the acquisition side of our supply chain and across the competitive environment in our markets. The short and sweet answer is that our industry remains rational and cost and pricing continue to be very stable, consistent with what we have seen over the past several quarters. Our supplier partners continue to see some degree of inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we have been able to realize incremental opportunities to reduce acquisition costs across some product categories.These puts and takes are occurring in a much more normalized pattern than what we experienced in 2021 and 2022 and are in line with how we would view normal conditions in our industry from a historical perspective.Pricing to DIY and professional customers in the industry has remained rational. And we have not seen significant changes in market pricing dynamics in the industry in 2023. Where we have seen increases in product acquisition and other costs, we continue to be successful in passing these increases through in selling price and are confident that this will continue into the future. As we have discussed many times on these calls, price is ultimately not always the deciding factor that determines where a customer will take their business.Our team continues to perform at a high level by delivering industry-leading product availability and excellent customer service, and these strengths have enabled us to win share at appropriate gross margins in a competitive industry.As we move into the back half of 2023, our gross margin results can vary based on product sales mix in any individual quarter or the timing of the pass-through of acquisition cost changes. But we are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance and continue to expect the back half of the year to fall within the 50.8% to 51.3% range.Inventory per store finished the quarter at $762,000, which was in line with our expectations, up 12% from this time last year and 4% compared to the beginning of the year. We continue to track toward our planned inventory per store increase of 2% by the end of 2023. Our AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 134%, in line with the beginning of the year and slightly better than our expectations, supported by strong sales volumes and inventory turns.We are pleased with the health of our supply chain and continued improvements in store in-stock position. It is clear to us that our industry-leading inventory availability has been a key factor driving our robust sales results, and we continue to prioritize deploying the right inventory at the optimal position in our DC, hub and store network.Turning to our growth initiatives and capital investment. We are extremely excited to complete the very successful opening of our first new O'Reilly distribution center in Guadalajara, Mexico earlier in July. This 370,000 square foot facility will have the capacity to ultimately service 250 stores in the Guadalajara Metro area and surrounding regions in Mexico.Even more importantly, our new facility will be a game changer for our business model in Mexico. Since our entry into Mexico in 2019, we have supported our inventory strategies by utilizing a network of smaller distribution centers and warehouses that were part of the historical operations of Mayasa. Our new facility gives us the ability to deploy a much more significant inventory investment and leverage this enhanced and highly competitive inventory availability position.It is our goal in Mexico, just as in all our domestic markets, to be the industry leader in putting the right part in the hands of our customers faster than the competition. And our new facility in Guadalajara provides the necessary platform to execute our strategy. We have a long history of successful distribution center openings, but each new facility is a significant undertaking and requires incredible hard work and coordination across our organization.We could not be more pleased with the partnership between our U.S. and Mexico teams that drove the highly successful acquisition, development and opening of this new facility. It is an understatement to say that our store teams in Mexico are very energized by the opportunities that our new distribution center unlocks. And they are dedicated to leveraging all of our competitive advantages as they outwork the competition to grow market share.From a store growth perspective, we successfully opened 42 stores during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 100 net new store openings. Our team is on pace to hit our plan of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. Our openings in the first half of the year were very well balanced across our store footprint with new stores coming online in 34 different states, Puerto Rico and Mexico.Our ability to spread our growth across many markets positions us to be highly selective in hiring and training the outstanding teams that drive the success of our new stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and view our organic store growth as a key priority for our use of capital.Total capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2023 were $461 million, up substantially from the first 6 months of 2022, but in line with our ambitious plans to deploy capital against projects and initiatives that will drive long-term growth and operational gains for our business. We remain on target to hit our capital expenditure guidance range of $750 million to $800 million.To close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeremy.Jeremy Adam FletcherThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued hard work and exceptional professionalism. Now we will cover some additional details on our second quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023.For the quarter, sales increased $398 million driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales and a $75 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base.Brad covered our SG&amp;A expense in the quarter in detail, but I did want to provide some additional color on our deferred compensation plan expenses given the nature of how this plan runs through our income statement. For many years, the company has sponsored a nonqualified deferred comp plan for team members whose participation would otherwise be limited in our qualified 401(k) plan. Since this is a nonqualified plan, the company maintains a liability for the obligation to pay the value of the deferred compensation to team members in the future, adjusted to reflect asset performance and also holds a corresponding asset for the fully funded and participant-directed assets in the plan.However, market value changes in the plan are reflected on different line items on our income statement with an increase in value driving an increase in SG&amp;A expense and an offsetting benefit below the line in other income. Historically, the net impact has not been significant to either line item, but given the increased size of the planned assets and the more significant market value changes both in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, we wanted to highlight the difference so that you will be able to update your models.The year-over-year swing in the market values of planned assets drove a $9 million increase in SG&amp;A expense or 24 basis points with a corresponding $9 million year-over-year favorable change in other income and expense.Our second quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 1.8% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter 2022 rate of 23.8% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by 0.5% benefit from share-based compensation. Our second quarter base tax rate was in line with our expectations with the total effective tax rate below our expectations due to the higher-than-planned benefits from share-based compensation.For the full year of 2023, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.5% comprised of a base rate of 23.4%, reduced by a benefit of 0.9% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the totaling of certain tax periods. Variation in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2023 was $1.2 billion, in line with the first half of 2022, with growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits, offset by increased capital expenditures in 2023 versus the prior year and a lower benefit from a reduction in net inventory this year versus 2022. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow at a range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, up $100 million from our previous guidance range based on operating cash flow performance in the first half of the year.Moving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.92x, which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 0.8 million shares at an average share price of $904.37 for a total investment of $680 million. Year-to-date, through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average share price of $855.22 for a total investment of $1.9 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price, inclusive of the current excise tax cost, is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.As a reminder, the updated EPS guidance outlined by Greg earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.Finally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success.This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanIt's Simeon Gutman. Congratulations to Brad, Brent and Greg. My first question is market share. It looks like the spread with O'Reilly in the industry is accelerating, at least it has in this calendar year. A question as to what do you attribute it. The only thing that we could put our finger on is a year ago, the PPI initiative. So maybe it just took a year for those investments to rue. So curious what you're take on the market share acceleration is due to.Brad W. BeckhamYes. Simeon, thanks. It's Brad. Yes, I think the PPI is a little bit easy to point to because it's a little bit more tangible for everybody who looks into our company. But I would say that if you talk to our operators like we do every day, the biggest thing we're seeing is just a huge opportunity starting with our team, our culture. The things we've done to stabilize our team to rebound from kind of the COVID hangover in terms of some of the turnover and maybe what was subpar for us from a service standpoint is we just feel really great, first and foremost, about the teams we build, what we're doing with our human capital and the service that our store teams, our distribution teams and our corporate offices are providing.Second thing I would say is that, especially from operations and sales, the first thing they point to when we talk to them about what we're seeing in the market, Simeon, is the position we're in from a supply chain standpoint. As you know as good as anybody, our immediacy of need in nondiscretionary business, it's all about -- on both sides of the business, it's all about who has the right part at the right place at the right time. And I just couldn't be more pleased with the job that Brent and the merchant team, the inventory management purchasing team and our distribution teams are doing for our store operators. They have just got us in a better position than we've been in a long time. And we feel like we're playing from a position of strength from the team side, from the supply chain side and all the work we're doing with our professional customers out in the field every day making sales calls. And then obviously, we still feel good about everything we did with PPI.Gregory D. JohnsonYes. Simeon, if I could maybe add to what Brad said there, first of all, thanks for the congrats. And Brad did a nice job of expressing confidence in the supply chain team and our inventory position. Obviously, as we've said over and over again, we've got to be competitive on price, which we are and continue to be and will continue to be. But what outweighs price is inventory availability and service level. And Brad and his teams in the field have just done an outstanding job of making sure we're positioned to provide the highest level of service in the industry.Simeon Ari GutmanYes. And maybe the follow-up on that point, this year, you're investing it sounds like a little more at stores to get the experience improved. Service was part of it. Is there a case that you should continue to lean in given that you have transitions happening at competitors? Might we see that the flow-through be a little weaker, as you should just lean into the business especially given how strong it is? Is that a thought that investment mode may continue?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. Great question, Simeon. And I think you've picked up, I think, the key thesis behind this. As we've talked about it, really all year, they're coming into 2023. We've just identified areas that we felt really from a long-term perspective allow us to invest within our business and continue to really double down on the momentum that we've seen.For us to have, I think, such a sustained expense control culture within our organization for such a long period of time, that's a substantial undertaking to think about it in those ways and to move forward. And absolutely, as we've done that, that has been very focused and targeted towards a strong return on those dollars that we're spending in. And we've thought about that from a long-term perspective.We -- here we are, we sit in July halfway through a year, and I think we've given clear expectations around where we think we'll finish out the year. And funny, we don't really provide guidance for 2024 until later on and we get closer. So I think it's a little bit premature for us to, I think, talk too specifically about that.For sure, 2023 has been a high year for us. But at the same time, to your question, I'm not going to say that as we move forward, we won't find other opportunities for us to invest in our business, and we'll continue to do so aggressively where we feel like that's appropriate.Having said that, we have an expense control focus. We're diligent in how we manage to that. And it's our expectation that we'll continue to see the levels of productivity on a long-term basis and improvements in how we think about the returns on our operating cost spend that is consistent with what we've seen over the long course of our business.Simeon Ari GutmanWell done. Good luck in the second half.Gregory D. JohnsonThanks, Simeon.Brad W. BeckhamThanks, Simeon.OperatorYour next question is coming from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.Gregory Scott MelichMy first question is on the same-SKU rate of disinflation. I think you said it's coming in as planned. Could you just update us on what that actually was in the quarter and what you expect it to be in the back half?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, Greg. We -- I think we had said that it was mid-single digits in the quarter. We think that moderates in the back half of the year. It won't get all the way to flat. But we would expect it to -- by the time we kind of exit this year, at that stage, you're really just talking about kind of what we've seen in the current year from a year-over-year perspective.And we've kind of -- as Greg mentioned in -- or I'm sorry, as Brent mentioned in his comments, we've kind of normalized to what we think are more kind of historical long-term rates there. So that would -- that puts you kind of in the low single-digit range. But really, as Brent mentioned, that's all falling -- almost directly in line with what we would have anticipated for this year.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. And then maybe you talk a little bit about the category mix that you're seeing in both pro and DIY. It sounded like some of the bigger-ticket stuff with some of your competitors got a little softer, maybe some trade-out happening in those categories or batteries, how some of these things are doing on both sides of the house.Brent G. KirbyYes, Greg. Well, I'll speak to a little bit of that in terms of categories at a high level. I mean we always are looking for -- we have complete lines across good, better, best product offerings. We're always looking, is there any trade-down, trade-across, trade-up, depending on where the consumer is.And similar to what we saw in the first quarter and how we answered this question on the call a quarter ago, we actually saw a little bit of a trade-up from better to best and good kind of stayed where -- at the normal baseline that we've seen historically there. So we're not seeing trade-down with the consumer at this point.I mean in terms of categories where we have seen strength, I would attribute a lot of that strength to better in-stock position in categories like radiators and, in some case, brake components versus where we were a year ago on a comparable basis or even where we were in first quarter on some of those categories. So we continue to see our store in-stock position improve. And as we talked about in our prepared comments, we really believe that's a huge contributor to our share gains.Gregory D. JohnsonYes, Greg, this is Greg. I just might add one comment there. In addition to what Brent said, we continue to also see strength and growth in our proprietary brands as well. They currently make up over half of our sales overall.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. That's great and good luck.Brad W. BeckhamYes. Thanks, Greg. Appreciate it.OperatorYour next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversCongratulations to everybody on their updates. My first question is as you -- can you talk about what you're seeing from a national accounts versus the ""up and down the street"" business perspective? Is one of relative strength? Are you seeing any pricing differential in those 2 businesses? It sounds like the answer is no. And then lastly, I think it would be helpful maybe if you could size how much national accounts contribute to the overall business.Brad W. BeckhamChris, it's Brad. I'll start this one, and a couple of others may want to jump in. But great question. I think, as you know, us growing our company over the last few decades from humble beginnings here in the center part of the country and growing out toward the coast through acquisition and greenfield expansion. We founded our company on the independent garage, the -- what you call the ""up and down the street"" accounts, the small everything from a shade tree mechanic to the larger independent garages that compete very well with the larger players.And then obviously, as we've grown over time, you have your small accounts, you have your midsized accounts. And then obviously, we do have a sizable book of strategic account business that's made up of both national players and regional players.Part of that, as you know, Chris, is we still have that gap in footprint. We have kind of in the upper Mid-Atlantic and going up into New York in those markets that doesn't always match up with some of the biggest national players. So that's still an opportunity for us as we build out the U.S. But really from what we've seen from your direct question about kind of what we're seeing in our share gains and momentum and how that relates to pricing on the street, we're seeing every bit of our business grow very consistently from the small shops, the larger independent garages, our strategic accounts, all that is very consistent in what we're seeing.And we've never quantified the exact how that splits out between our strategic and our other book of business. But I would tell you that our -- by far, the foundation of our professional business is the independent garage in the way that we built that from the ground up.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. Chris, I'd just add one thing to that, maybe in respect to your size question. Brad talked about it, those are -- the national and regional account, they're very important customers to us. They're an important part of our business. But we may differ from others in that the relative size of that business for us is not so significant that it's a huge need to move into our overall performance.It's important, as Brad mentioned. It's grown consistently well along with the rest of our business. But it's not a dynamic that has caused our results to be significantly different than the broader base of business.Christopher Michael HorversGot it. My follow-up question is for you, Jeremy. I mean, if you look back historically, gross margin seasonality is pretty flattish over the year, ex periods where you have inflation or deflation -- I'm sorry, like -- yes, inflation or disinflation in the business. And you talked about things getting back to normal. So I guess, does that -- would that suggest that the back half of the year is maybe in the sort of the upper half of your guide sort of consistent with the year-to-date level?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes -- no. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the question. And you've been around our story for a really long time to go back to those periods when you could say that the quarter-to-quarter wasn't impacted by some of the noisy items. The LIFO story itself has been a long history. But I think you're appropriate to identify that, generally speaking, seasonality, it has some impact on our gross margin results. Product mix in any quarter can have some impact as well. But they're going to be, I think, much less muted moving forward than some of the larger variances we've seen.I'd tell you, we'd be cautious in saying the guidance would be in the back half of the year -- or is it in the top half of the range in the back half of the year for no other reason than we've seen our professional business continue to perform well.And we give a guidance range for a reason. There's going to be some degree of volatility around product mix and the timing of pricing, and Brent called those out in the script. But we feel comfortable with the guidance range that we've had and really with the strength of our gross margin as we've seen our business accelerate and be successful. It's important for us to be able to grow those sales in the right way, and we've seen that with, I think, the steadiness of our gross margin results.OperatorYour next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist.Scot CiccarelliIt's Scot Ciccarelli. We're hearing from the field that services facilities are seeing slower tire sales. Presumably, that would stem from increased economic pressures. So the questions are, a, are you hearing similar from your customers? And then, b, even though you guys don't sell tires, you would presumably sell parts on a car being brought in for service. So how much exposure to such a trend could O'Reilly have just from a customer standpoint?Brad W. BeckhamScot, it's Brad. As you said, we don't sell tires. And I want to be careful not to speak for the professional customer installer base. But what we see generally is kind of good and good, meaning if our shops are selling a lot of tires, then they have wheels off, they have -- they're looking at -- they're doing inspections, they're looking at brake parts, they're looking at the chassis, they're looking at a lot of different things.But then if they're not selling tires, they have a little bit more time on their hands to spend a little bit more time with customers and diagnose better and potentially get ahead of some of the DIFM jobs. So I just want to be careful to answer that too pointed versus that population. But we haven't really seen anything with softer tire sales the way business comes to us. We really haven't seen anything on that front.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. I think maybe just more broadly, Scot, the consumer that we engage in and interact with continues to be resilient and healthy. We -- as you know, we benefit from just the nature of our industry and the immediacy and need and the key value of that transportation demand being so high that we always tend to be a little bit lagging to others that start to see pressure there.We're cognizant that in short periods of time, you could see customer reactions. But we still have a lot of confidence in what we see as we interact with our customers. They're valuing the proposition of keeping the cars on the road. There -- it's a good return on their investment. I think we'll continue to see that as we have in past economic cycles. But at this point, we haven't seen any of those types of things that you would point to that would indicate the customer -- or our customers suffering.Brent G. KirbyAnd maybe Scot, just maybe to add one other point to the points that Brad and Jeremy have already made. Interestingly enough, we've continued to see strength in undercar, ride control, chassis, a lot of those categories that are getting looked at when the car is up on the rack. So just throw that in as well for color.Scot CiccarelliI appreciate that. And then just a quickie on accounts payable if inventory stays pretty elevated. Jeremy, is there any reason that should shift by the time we hit year-end? Or is it just the accelerated sales pace and we should continue to see kind of like 125%-, 130%-type ratio?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, we would expect it would it would stay at reasonably elevated levels there. Sometimes it can moderate a bit just on seasonality of how some things flow through in the back half of the year within our free cash flow expectations. We've got a little bit of that built in. But we continue to see strong productivity out of existing inventory even as we've added over the course of the last year and the ability to turn that inventory helps us to maintain that negative net investment that is still nice to have.OperatorYour next question is coming from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.Brian William NagelI would like to add my congratulations to the promotions all around. So the question I have -- the first question, just with respect -- I guess looking to the back half of the year, and you talked about sort of say, the waning benefits of, I guess, inflation from a sales perspective. But as we think about that then, should we also expect on the other side potentially -- at least the potential for more benefits on the gross margin front with potentially easing sourcing costs?Brent G. KirbyYes. Brian, I can start on that. I mean I would just tell you, and I mentioned it in the script, a lot of suppliers are still under some pressure from increased cost of capital, increased raw materials, increased labor cost. I mean we do see that.We also, though, are always aggressively looking at price and cost of goods and doing everything we can to drive out cost of goods and purchase the best we can. Greg talked a little bit earlier about proprietary brands and our continued strength we see in growth in those proprietary brands. That gives us an opportunity to shop that with multiple suppliers and be multi-sourced in those categories, which is certainly a strategic strength for us and an opportunity on the cost side.But I would tell you, in general, the -- a lot of our suppliers would tell you, they're still under cost pressure, as you would expect them to report that. But we feel like we're in a very good position to mitigate that through this period and have done that in many cases.Brian William NagelGot it. That's helpful. So my follow-up question, just with respect to June. So we've heard others in your sector talk about weaker June, and others in retail talk about a weaker June. I mean it sounds like your business was pretty steady. So I guess the question is, I mean, did you see anything in the month of June to suggest weakness? And if you didn't, can you -- is there an explanation of why O'Reilly performed so much better than others in that month?Jeremy Adam FletcherTo answer the question directly, right, we didn't see weakness in June. We were pleased with our results for the month. The compares obviously are different month-to-month. But relative to our expectations, it performed as strongly as in the other months, actually a little bit higher. The actual comp, they were all within a really tight band. So we feel positive.We obviously week-to-week, month-to-month evaluate all of the individual drivers of our business. And I think it's tough in such a time period to be able to parse out too much what we see versus what others in the marketplace might see. But we saw solid demand really across regions, across categories throughout the quarter.Brian William NagelI appreciate it. Congrats again.Brad W. BeckhamThanks, Brian.Brent G. KirbyThanks, Brian.OperatorYour next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneWe just wanted to make sure that aside from the moderating inflation and some of the challenging ticket count compares, if there was anything else driving the sequentially lower comp outlook for the second half of the year.Jeremy Adam FletcherNo, Kate. I mean, I think you've identified what really we've talked about since we established our guidance at the beginning of the year. Most of the cadence differences as we move quarter-to-quarter throughout 2023 in the actual math that pushes out our comp, it relates to the way volumes flowed in, in 2022. So for sure, there's a waning same-SKU benefit.'22 is also a unique year for us, really on both sides of our business where from a transaction perspective, the back half was stronger than the first half for different reasons. The DIY, we faced some pressure in the front half of last year for just volatility in the overall macro economy and then responded better. And then on the professional side, we've continued to see ramp growth there from a transaction perspective.Really, as we think about the balance of the year, nothing has changed about where we would expect on a sequential volume basis to be our overall business when we think week-to-week from a dollar standpoint. We're anticipating to remain consistent and strong. We're excited about the trends that we've produced in the business.OperatorYour next question is coming from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.Michael Allen BakerReal quick, can you just talk about the heat that we're seeing throughout the country and how this impacts your business? And specifically, I think you said -- I hate to put -- to have 2 short term, but you said that July was continuing the strength that you saw in June with incremental benefit from the weather. So does that actually mean that July was better than June?Brad W. BeckhamThanks, Mike. It's Brad. Yes. As you know, heat -- we like heat, we like extremes, and we work in enough markets, especially where the hot weather really contributes to failure and weather be immediate. One thing to remember about heat is a lot of time, something like a battery, heat kills batteries, but then it fails in the winter. So we want to be a little bit cautious.But overall, we're really excited about where our business is. We're excited where we ended the quarter, and we're really excited about how we started July. We're always a little bit careful with a 3-week period, but there's no doubt in our minds that what we're seeing in the market and -- relating to weather that the heat is good for us, and we're doing everything we can to capitalize on it.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, Mike. Brad said it right. We don't ever overreact to 3-week periods of time. But it should come as no surprise, you walk outside, you know that, that hot weather is good for us. And that's how we would, I think, frame Brad's comments in the prepared comments around that is, yes, we've seen the benefit that you would expect to see with the weather we've had.Michael Allen BakerGreat. Excellent. One more quick follow-up. The deferred compensation impact in the second quarter that you talked about, that $9 million shift, do we -- does that continue into the third and fourth quarter? I presume if it does or doesn't, that's in the guidance, but just trying to think about how to think about that in terms of our models.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. We don't -- you know we don't do a lot of forecasting within our guide there. We hate to even talk about it, but it does create noise on that other income and expense line. It just really kind of depends on the broader market activity that impacts those accounts. And in normal periods, it's not a needle mover, but it just happened to coincide in the second quarter that it creates noise.Michael Allen BakerUnderstood. So in other words, it wasn't a catch-up in the second quarter. It has to do with, I presume, the increase in the stock price during the quarter.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. When the market recovers, we see the liability go up, the assets go up. It's a net nothing. It literally -- it perfectly offsets, it just creates noise.Michael Allen BakerRight. It's important, though, because it makes looks like your SG&amp;A is higher than expected and that the only reason why you beat earnings is because of below-the-line items. But -- so I think it's important to understand it's just a change in the geography.Jeremy Adam FletcherYes, agreed.OperatorYour next question is coming from Seth Bashman (sic) [Seth Basham] from Wedbush Securities.Seth Mckain BashamSales productivity on a per employee basis was very strong, reaching on a new record by my calculation. I mean, first, do you see this as sustainable? And then second, can you provide more color on wages and benefits in the quarter and how you expect them to trend going forward on a year-over-year growth basis?Jeremy Adam FletcherYes. So maybe I can start there and then others can chime in, Seth, and probably answer the second question first. Overall, from a workforce perspective, continuing to see pressure from a wage rate standpoint there. I'd tell you, it's largely in line with what we're seeing with the inflation benefit that we've seen on our top line. And all of that were within our expectations.I know Brad talked about the SG&amp;A as we've seen the opportunities to invest. But none of our spend outside of our original guide was driven by wage rates. Those were in line with where we had expected.And we continue to anticipate that we'll have opportunities from an investment perspective in the team member experience enhancements that we've had. We felt very positive about those. I talked about those at length. Those start to moderate just on a comparison basis as we move throughout the year for the things that we've been executing.In terms of where that's driven us from a productivity perspective on the sales per team member, absolutely. We're seeing a very robust top line. And Brad talked about it at length in the sense that we really believe that we're winning business based upon the strength of our team and the service and value that they're providing. And we think that our ability to double down on the strength of our team is really going to help us continue to sustain that and improve it as we move forward.Seth Mckain BashamGot it. Congrats to Greg, Brad and Brent.Gregory D. JohnsonThanks, Seth.Brent G. KirbyThanks, Seth.OperatorWe have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks.Gregory D. JohnsonThank you, Matthew.

Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a prolonged low interest rate environment; the elimination of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""); the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience for insurance and annuity products could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC asset and other actuarial balances may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends, make share repurchases and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends or other distributions Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; the company’s hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient; international business risks; risks arising from participation in joint ventures; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its ""Closed Block"" assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; risks related to administering reinsurance transactions; a pandemic, terrorist attack, military action or other catastrophic event; global climate change; technological and societal changes may disrupt the company’s business model and impair its ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain its profitability; damage to the company’s reputation; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in information technology, infrastructure or other internal or external systems used for business operations, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees; and the company’s enterprise risk management framework may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating all of the risks to which the company is exposed.Use of Non-GAAP financial measuresThe company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.Earnings conference callOn Friday, Jul. 28, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. (ET), Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dan Houston and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Deanna Strable will lead a discussion of results and the impacts on future prospects, asset quality and capital adequacy during a live conference call, which can be accessed as follows:Via live Internet webcast.

511,aac36883-a110-3b75-a3e7-85797a7437c6,AFL,2023-07-28,Allstate (ALL) to Report Q2 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allstate-report-q2-earnings-heres-162500236.html,1690475100,STORY,"['ALL', 'AFL']","[The Allstate Corporation ALL is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.What do the Estimates SayThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share is pegged at a loss of $3.83. Notably, a loss of 76 cents per share was reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark witnessed six downward revisions against none in the opposite direction in the past week.The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $13.8 billion indicates a 6.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Allstate beat the consensus estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 18.5%. This is depicted in the graph below:The Allstate Corporation Price and ConsensusThe Allstate Corporation Price and ConsensusThe Allstate Corporation price-consensus-chart | The Allstate Corporation QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it is worth looking at ALL’s first-quarter performance.Q1 Earnings RewindThe Property and Casualty insurer reported an adjusted loss of $1.30 per share for the previous quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.94 per share. The quarterly results took a hit from significant catastrophe losses, escalating expenses and lower contributions from the Protection Services and Health and Benefits segments.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Factors to NoteRevenues of Allstate are likely to have benefited on the back of improved premiums in the Property-Liability segment in the second quarter. Higher average premiums resulting from frequent rate increases in its auto insurance business coupled with policy growth in the homeowners’ insurance business are likely to have aided the Property-Liability segment. However, escalating loss costs resulting from persistent inflationary pressure are expected to have affected both the auto and homeowners’ insurance businesses in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect premiums earned for the second quarter to be $10,970.7 million, implying a 0.9% year-over-year increase.Story continuesALL’s top line is expected to have received an impetus from the rising net investment income due to growing market-based investment income. This, in turn, is likely to have been aided by increased yields from fixed-income securities.However, the continued incidence of catastrophe losses is likely to have dampened the underwriting performance of Allstate in the second quarter. We expect catastrophe losses to increase 59.2% year-over-year in the second quarter.Softer underwriting results are expected to have led to a deteriorating combined ratio. Increasing loss costs are expected to degrade the overall efficiency of ALL’s operations, signaling a deteriorating combined ratio. However, our estimate for the combined ratio stands at 107.1% for the second quarter, suggesting an improvement of 80 basis points year over year.Improved Allstate Protection Plan revenues might have contributed to the sound performance of the Protection Services segment of Allstate in the second quarter. We expect premiums earned for this segment to be $523 million in the second quarter, implying a 7.2% year-over-year increase. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its protection services through new products and geographic locations as part of its strategy to improve results.Meanwhile, the Allstate Health and Benefits segment is likely to have gained on expanding premiums from group health products coupled with an improving benefit ratio in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite prudent cost-curbing initiatives, margins of Allstate are expected to have suffered due to elevated property and casualty insurance claims and claims expenses in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Allstate this time around.

You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AFL carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, the results of Aflac Japan are likely to have received an impetus from the launch of an enhanced cancer insurance product, thereby leading to increased persistency rates and higher sales. An improved expense ratio is expected to have contributed to the segment’s results. However, limited pay products attaining paid-up status and the execution of a global reinsurance strategy are likely to have been roadblocks for AFL’s Japan unit in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect adjusted revenues of Aflac Japan to be $2,614.8 million in the second quarter, which hints toward a year-over-year decline of 17%.The prospects of Aflac U.S. are expected to have gained from improved adjusted net investment income, which in turn, is likely to have stemmed from expanding floating rate income. Additionally, strong dental and vision sales, new product launches and tie-ups are expected to have driven the unit’s quarterly results. However, an elevated expense level in relation to pursued investments across emerging growth businesses is likely to have dampened the performance of the unit in the second quarter.Our estimate for adjusted net investment income in the segment stands at $195.7 million in the to-be-reported quarter, suggesting 1.4% growth year over year. We anticipate adjusted revenues of $1,616.8 million in Aflac U.S., which indicates a 0.7% dip year over year.Multiple cost-curbing initiatives are likely to have provided some respite to Aflac’s margins in the second quarter.  The company continues to undertake investments to upgrade core technology platforms or digital capabilities in order to save costs, bring about automation in processes and boost operational efficiencies. Our estimate for total acquisition and other operating expenses stands at $1,262.3 million, which implies a decline of 5.4% year over year.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies from the insurance space, which according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank of 2, currently.

This compares to earnings of $0.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this holding company for Riverview Community Bank would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of -26.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Riverview Bancorp , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry, posted revenues of $13.64 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.13%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.79 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Riverview Bancorp shares have lost about 27.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Riverview Bancorp?While Riverview Bancorp has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Riverview Bancorp: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

516,0622fb03-1d29-333d-ba20-7172530c5c0a,UHS,2023-07-28,The one-year decline in earnings might be taking its toll on Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) shareholders as stock falls 6.6% over the past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-decline-earnings-might-taking-142841116.html,1690468121,STORY,['UHS'],"[These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) share price is up 27% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 11% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Looking back further, the share price is 26% higher than it was three years ago.In light of the stock dropping 6.6% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive one-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Universal Health Services There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year, Universal Health Services actually saw its earnings per share drop 2.7%.Sometimes companies will sacrifice EPS in the short term for longer term gains; and in that case we may be able to find other positives. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We doubt the modest 0.6% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. We think that the revenue growth of 5.8% could have some investors interested. We do see some companies suppress earnings in order to accelerate revenue growth.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthUniversal Health Services is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsStory continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Universal Health Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 27% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 3% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast within the accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I will now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.Aaron MusgraveThank you, Sasha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of second quarter and year-to-date results and thoughts on our affirmed 2023 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our successful financing activities in the first half of the year, cover our financial results in more detail, and we'll close with an update on our acquisition activity. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, regulatory updates and will conclude with a review of our recently published sustainability report and other new disclosures. We'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.Story continuesM. Susan HardwickThanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter compared to $1.20 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the same period of 2022. The results were in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong compared to last year due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in '22 and early '23 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. We continue to execute on our regulatory strategy, which continues to be the key driver of our results. Revenues in the second quarter were also higher due to increased usage from warm and unusually dry weather in several of our states. Tempering results were higher operating costs, which John will elaborate on further. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. We invested nearly $1.2 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. Also, as you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2023 includes approximately $400 million for acquisitions, including 2 sizable transactions we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for future acquisitions remains strong as we have over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement, including those 2 sizable deals. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. And as we announced last month, we completed a convertible debt issuance of just over $1 billion that achieved the other key element of our 2023 financing plan. Finally, earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report. Cheryl will share a few highlights of the report, but at its core, it tells the story of how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable way to American Water customers. And this has been our mission for over 135 years. Turning to Slide 6. We are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 per share to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. And once again, we are affirming our long-term targets. I continue to believe that our regulatory -- our strong regulatory financing and operational execution is the differentiator from our peers. Our track record of executing on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover some second quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?John C. GriffithThanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I'll start by reviewing the successful completion of our 2023 financing plan. As Susan mentioned, and as I covered on the last call, earlier this year, we completed an upsized equity offering for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan, as we've previously communicated. Then last month, we issued just over $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes due in 2026 with an annual interest rate of 3.625%. As we previously disclosed, this exchangeable debt issuance supports our long-term growth as a diversified, low-cost funding source that benefits customer affordability and shareholder value. Upon any exchange of the notes, the principal amount will be settled in cash, with flexibility to settle any remaining value above the principal amount in cash, shares or a combination thereof at our election. We used the proceeds from both of these transactions to bring our commercial paper balance to zero by quarter end with almost $800 million of cash yet to be utilized, that is earning interest. With our 2023 long-term financing needs now complete, our balance sheet is well positioned to fund our robust water and wastewater investment growth. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition, our total debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash on the balance sheet, remains at 54% as of June 30, which is well below our target of 60%. We believe our current debt maturity levels, in conjunction with future debt needs, are very manageable. And I would remind you, as shown on this slide, of the [$720 million] of no proceeds that we will receive in 2026 from the sale of HOS completed in 2021. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk. And finally, on liquidity, we remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 10, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter of $0.24 per share versus the same period in 2022 and up $0.17 per share on a weather-normalized basis. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in the quarter by an estimated $0.07 per share due to weather in 2023, due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But we did see unusual weather in the quarter resulting in higher throughput, which we typically don't see during this time of year. Our investments in resiliency and our proactive communications to customers around water conservation ensured that we did not experience any significant operating issues during the quarter. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.04 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.03 per share, including inflationary pressures, were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Based on the current outlook, we are not expecting the cost of chemicals to decrease in the near term as demand remains elevated. Our operating costs in the second quarter also increased due to a higher employee headcount to support growth in the business. As we've said, our proactive strategy last year to seek rate recovery of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023. This approach continues in our recently filed cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.06 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.11 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided interest expense in the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well, based on the current outlook. Turning to Slide 11. Earnings increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.23 per share year-to-date, which, as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Before we look at our expected full year 2023 EPS details, I should note that, as you would expect in the year of an equity issuance, our quarterly EPS results may not sum to equal the year-to-date EPS results each quarter. This is simply due to a different amount of average shares outstanding used in the EPS calculations as the year progresses. Turning to Slide 12. I'll echo Susan's comments that our results remain on track to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Here, we provide some updated details related to 2023 guidance that reflect results so far this year, including the completed 2023 financing plan. You can see, for example, that our implied revenue growth for the second half of the year will be strong, though somewhat less than the first half growth as new rates became effective in New Jersey last September. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our strengthened balance sheet, to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. Turning to Slide 13, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We closed on 10 acquisitions, totaling $33 million, across 5 states in the first half of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of June, totaling $555 million and includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We now expect to close both of these transactions near the end of 2023, pending regulatory approvals for each. Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we expect to purchase for $104 million, as announced back in March. We continue to expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving all of these customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. With our track record of closing on acquisitions and executing on our CapEx plans, we are confident that we will achieve our capital investment plan of $2.9 billion for 2023. And when you combine that with the financing we have already completed to fund growth, we believe our outlook for 2023 and beyond is very attractive for investors. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?Cheryl D. NortonThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by commenting on our continued focus on investing in our systems. Slide 15 shows a recap of our capital investment so far in 2023. As John said, we remain on plan to meet our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of total capital spending for the full year. Our state teams continue to execute each quarter on the multitude of projects that improve our systems. Two examples of the types of projects we're working on are improvements to the lime softening system, chemical facilities and filters at the Jerseyville, Illinois water treatment plan and enhanced [ariation] capabilities and other digester improvements at the Coatesville water treatment plant in Pennsylvania. These renewal and improvement projects are typical examples of how the capital we deploy is essential to our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable drinking water and wastewater services. And finally, as John mentioned, our larger acquisitions in 2023 are expected to occur in the second half of the year as compared to 2022, when the first half of the year included our largest acquisition for the year, over $200 million for the City of York's wastewater system. Let's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases, with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Sharing with our -- starting with our general rate cases in California and Indiana, both are progressing as expected. In Indiana, hearings are expected in early fall, which follows testimony filed by all parties in July and August. In California, we expect hearings in the fall as well. At the beginning of May, we filed a general rate case in West Virginia, reflecting $340 million in water and wastewater system investments, covering 2020 through 2025. We are seeking $45 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges. We would expect an order in February of next year. At the end of June, we filed a general rate case in Kentucky, reflecting $330 million in water system investments since the last rate case order in 2019. We are seeking $26 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges, to support continued, safe and reliable service and recovery of increased production costs. We would expect an order in this case in February of next year. In Missouri, we were pleased to receive a final decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission in May. The negotiated settlement reflects the increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. Though not specifically noted in the order, our view of the return on equity allowed is 9.75%, and the equity ratio is [50%]. Outside of general rate cases, the California Commission issued a decision on June 29 on California American Water's 2021 cost of capital application, authorizing an 8.98% ROE, with an equity component of 57.04%. The decision was not retroactive and will be effective through the end of 2024. The following day, we filed an advice letter, as authorized by the state's water cost of capital mechanism, seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, increasing the return on equity to 9.50% effective July 31. As Susan mentioned, our regulatory execution is a key driver of our results and our team continues to do an excellent job. As we previously discussed, we submitted written comments on the federal EPA's proposed [PFAS] rule in May. The key concern that we voiced is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our internal and preliminary estimates show that capital investments in excess of $1 billion will be needed by American Water, along with nearly $50 million of annual operating expenses in order to comply with the rule as currently proposed. We are still evaluating the potential impact of our 5-year capital plan, including whether PFAS will drive incremental CapEx in the plan or if some currently planned projects will be completed later beyond the 5-year horizon or both. We expect to have more to share on that in the third quarter earnings call. Related to ongoing PFAS litigation and the announcement of some settlements with manufacturers of PFAS , we are a long way from knowing what these settlements mean for our customers, including if, how and when funds from these settlements or other litigation may ultimately be distributed. We will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the cleanup of these contaminants should fall to the polluters, and we will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities, balanced with affordability. Another topic that's been in the news recently is around certain telecommunication companies and their historical usage of lead-insulated cables. While these stories don't relate to American Water, we'd remind you to review the disclosures we've had for many years in our Form 10-K around the replacement of lead service lines in our regulated service territories. We are in great shape related to that replacement program. Finally, on Slide 17, earlier this week, we released our latest sustainability report, covering the years 2021 and 2022. This report highlights our commitment to excellent water quality, customer affordability and continued investing in water and wastewater infrastructure and our sustainable business practices and values that align with these commitments. To demonstrate our ESG leadership and commitment to transparency, we also continue to expand and update disclosures related to how we operate the business, some of which we've referenced here. And we're pleased to continue to be recognized by leading ESG rating services such as MSCI for our actions and our disclosures in this space. One final comment before I wrap up. As you know, there have been several weather events this quarter, including the severe flooding in New York State. While we no longer have regulated utility operations there, we do operate the water system and 2 wastewater treatment plants at U.S. Military Academy, West Point through our Military Services Group business. Our teams there went above and beyond to ensure West Point could continue to operate and have continued access to safe and reliable water and wastewater services, and we did so safely. Our teams across the entire business are experts at what they do every day. We thank them and are grateful for their commitment and expertise in delivering to those we serve and doing so in a safe and sustainable way. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&amp;A and take any questions you may have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.Paul Andrew ZimbardoGreat. The first question I had was, I know there was a good number of changes on the drivers within full year '23 guidance, if you could just unpack like where were you seeing that better revenue net O&amp;M strength in the year-to-date or second half, wherever it lands?M. Susan HardwickYes. Let me comment first, and certainly, John can add to it. I think really it's -- you can look on the revenue side, primarily, timing of rate cases and the resulting revenue increases and then also additional costs that we have built into those rate cases. We've been talking quite a bit about inflationary impacts and higher chemical costs and production costs, and we've been successful in getting those higher costs built into a number of the cases we did last year. And as those cost increases have gone up, the associated revenue recovery has gone up. So I'd say, those are the primary drivers. On the sort of financing cost side, those changes really driven by just the timing of primarily this long-term debt issue we just did and then higher costs associated with short-term debt financing. I think, John, that probably covers the main ones. Any other items to add?John C. GriffithYes, I think it does. That's right. Paul, we started to pick up New Jersey revenue last September, so that moderates year-over-year growth. And I'd say on -- from an inflation perspective, we're starting to see production costs moderate as we've come through the second quarter here.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Great. And then on the balance sheet side, I know a great job cleaning up, taking out all that short-term debt. On the long term, one question I had was, I noticed you changed the language slightly to equal to or less than 60% debt to total cap versus before it's just less than 60%. Does that mean you anticipate that trending up closer to 60%? Just overall thoughts on kind of where you stand on that going through the long-term plan.John C. GriffithYes. Paul, no real change there as we're thinking about it. As you know, we're raising financing in a periodic sort of manner. So we do expect to trend up over time until we reset again with equity, but no significant change there.OperatorThe next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiSo first, maybe -- you mentioned the rainy July in New York State. I mean it's -- for us living in the Mid-Atlantic, it seems like it's been the weather pattern in New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well. So is there any sense how -- if there's an offset to that $0.07 weather benefit from the second quarter thus far in the third quarter?M. Susan HardwickYes, Angie, we don't have any sort of prediction so far on impacts in July. I'd just remind you again that our outlook for the year remains on track to hit our expectations, again, on a weather-normalized basis. So just a bit early to tell what impact July may have across the entire territory.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. Secondly, the exchangeable bonds that you guys did, I mean they came at a low coupon likely -- I mean, probably not something that you have considered in your guidance. So should I think that it's actually a benefit to guidance? And also, how does that tie up to the financing of those 2 big acquisitions that you expect to close later this year? Were they always planned to close still in '23? Again, I'm just trying to see if there's any benefit from an interest expense perspective.M. Susan HardwickI'll answer the second part first and then ask John to sort of come the financing impacts. We continue to look very closely at the timing of those 2 transactions. And we've always expected them to be sort of at or close to year-end. That's still our expectation. That's been built in our plan all along. The regulatory process is a bit unpredictable, but we feel confident about the ability to get those wrapped up right towards the end of this year. John, you want to comment on the financing piece?John C. GriffithAngie, I would just say on the financing piece that we set our plan last fall at a time when we can't predict interest rates. And I think where we've come out on the convert is consistent with our guidance and our affirmation of 2023.Agnieszka Anna StorozynskiOkay. And my last question on the municipal M&amp;A. So you've been very successful at those very large acquisitions, even though some other companies have stumbled on those. Is this very much sort of a deal-specific issue, so there's no -- any deterioration in the regulatory environment or the receptivity of municipalities to sell large assets? I mean, again, we're trying to see if there's a trend, you seem to be way more successful than others in large municipal M&amp;A.M. Susan HardwickYes. I think, Angie, I'll say what I always say here, I think we are very good at it. I think we spend a lot of time in these communities cultivating the relationship. Our teams are very much embedded in these communities. I think they work closely with communities to define the need and to come up with the best solutions to meet those needs. I think that is continuing to be our strongest asset as it relates to acquisitions. I think the prospect for deals also continues to evolve. And I'd say, these larger deals have come about, I think, because circumstances warranted. It doesn't signal a change in our strategy. It doesn't signal a change in what I believe to be the environment, either for opportunity or regulatory acceptance or enthusiasm for deals generally. So I'd just say, they're circumstantial. And our expertise, I think, continues to be a real advantage we have here.OperatorThe next question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS.Gregg Gillander OrrillRegarding the Indiana rate case proceeding on schedule, are you expecting revenue recommendations from interveners? So is that coming up?M. Susan HardwickWell, I think the normal process would be to have testimony filed with all the parties in the case sort of later this summer, early fall. So I think the normal process, we would expect to see sort of full recommendations or positions taken by the various parties through that process.Gregg Gillander OrrillOkay. Sort of traditional process like other places?M. Susan HardwickYes. Yes, really nothing different.OperatorThe next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.James KennedyIt's actually James on for Shar. I guess, just -- first question was just on the [PFAS] figures, so the $1 billion. I guess, could you just speak to maybe the puts and takes as it relates to your ability to update with the capital plan on the third quarter call?What -- I guess, a little bit more color on how we should think about what of that $1 billion can roll into the forthcoming plan?M. Susan HardwickYes, it's a good question, and it's something obviously we're continuing to work on. And Cheryl alluded to this in her comments, we would expect to have quite a bit more visibility on our [third] quarter call, partly because our evaluation is certainly ongoing and our continued analysis of our various facilities to see where we may have exposure and what sort of treatment may be necessary. So that process is continuing. But I'd also just say, this is the time of year where we're doing all of our work relative to our financial plan. All the various updates throughout the business, and our capital planning is certainly a big part of that. So our normal cadence would be to continue to work through that planning process and be complete with it in the early fall, with the expectation that we would roll out our guidance and expectations for the next year and then the next 5-year and even 10-year outlook relative to capital when we get to that third quarter call. So we're just on sort of a normal cadence from a planning perspective. And then, as I said, on the evaluation of potential exposure, we're just still in the process of doing that work. And Cheryl, anything to add there?Cheryl D. NortonNo. I would just say that we also continue to collect samples at all these locations to just verify what the levels are and look for any seasonal kinds of variations and such as that. So we're still drilling into the details, but as Susan said, as we go through our regular planning process, we're using our prioritization models and deciding what could we move out or not move out. And so it's a lot of work and the teams really dug into the details right now.M. Susan HardwickYes. And I think that is the key. We just need to complete that risk analysis piece, and we'll see how much of this $1 billion ultimately results in incremental capital expansion of the plan versus just shifting to later periods -- shifting other work to later periods.James KennedyAnd I guess just the follow-up to that, too, is just the -- so we've got a few different regulations, EPA, a little uncertain over the [circular] designations. But has any of this changed your near-term approach to wastewater M&amp;A?M. Susan HardwickNo, I don't think so. We're continuing to look at that as a very important part of our strategy and continuing to look at those opportunities. We think there's a good set of opportunities in that space, largely driven again by just the aging infrastructure and how many of those systems were built initially and then many of them coming to sort of the end of their useful life. So we think the opportunities are plentiful. I would say, it doesn't change our strategy relative to that. But I do think, as we think about sort of total capital allocation and from a risk perspective and a growth opportunity perspective, we'll manage all of those opportunities within our capital financing capabilities.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

An underfollowed mid-cap utility with a history of strong operations is Alliant Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:LNT).The utility holding company provides regulated electricity and natural gas services. Interstate Power and Light Co., a subsidiary, primarily generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to retail customers in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. Another subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and Light Co., generates and distributes electricity and transports natural gas to retail customers in Wisconsin.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with LNT. Click here to check it out. LNT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LNTIt serves retail customers in the farming, agriculture, industrial manufacturing, chemical and packaging and food industries. The company owns and operates a short-line rail freight service in Iowa, a barge, rail and truck freight terminal on the Mississippi River and a rail-served warehouse in Iowa.Incorporated in 1981, the company is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. It currently has a market capitalization of $13.7 billion.Clean energy strategyAlliant has created a roadmap to achieve a resilient, affordable and clean energy future. The company plans to replace coal generation with a balanced mix of renewable and flexible energy. It is also adding approximately 1.5 gigawatts of solar between 2022 and 2024 and adding roughly 350 megawatts of battery storage by 2025. Part of the plan is to reduce coal and emissions by retiring or fuel-switching nearly 1.6 GW of coal generation between 2020 and 2026.There are additional plans for more renewable and other generation sources to strengthen the portfolio, improve seasonal reliability and help meet customer demand.There are also efforts to explore future technology solutions, including long-duration storage and sustainable fuel sources, investments in fault detection, self-healing, fiber and an advanced distribution management system, which supports reduced operating costs and a better customer experience.Story continuesFinancial reviewFor the first quarter ending March 31, revenue increased approximately 1% to $1.07 billion and operating income decreased 10.4% to $222 million. The primary drivers were lower retail electric and gas sales due to the effects of warmer than normal temperatures on customer demand in 2023, which compares to an increase in sales in the first quarter of 2022 due to the impacts of colder than normal temperatures on customer demand. In addition, higher interest expense and timing of income tax expense affected net earnings.The balance sheet remains strong with shareholders' equity of $6.3 billion and net property, plant and equipment of $16.4 billion.In a statement, Alliant CEO John Larsen said, We had a solid start to the year and are well positioned to deliver on our long-term growth objectives. With the exception of the mild weather, results were in line with our expectations, allowing us to reaffirm our 2023 earnings guidance. Guided by our purpose-driven clean energy transition, we are on track to place 840 MW of utility scale solar in service by the first half of 2024.ValuationThe company recently reaffirmed its earnings per share guidance for 2023 in the range of $2.82 to $2.96. There are a lot of notable assumptions in this guidance, including the ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return, a stable economy and the subsequent implications on utility sales, normal temperatures in utility service territories, execution on cost control measures, execution of capital expenditure and financing plans and a consolidated effected tax rate of 2%.The Wall Street consensus estimate is $2.89, which puts the company selling at a price-earnings ratio of 18.8, which is roughly in line with the sector average. The 2024 ratio drops to 17.6 based on 2024 estimates of $3.09.Further, the GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator creates a value of approximately $43 when using earnings per share of $2.89 as the starting point and a 6% long-term growth rate.The company currently pays an annualized dividend of $1.81, which equates to a 3.26% dividend yield. The payout ratio is 0.62, which is not too far out of line for a utility stock.There are four analyst currently covering the company with an average price target of $53.88, with a high target of $58 and a low target of $49.Guru tradesGurus who have added to their positions recently include Mairs and Power (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio). Investors who have reduced or sold out of their positions include Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio)'s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies.SummaryThe company has produced 5% to 7% earnings growth for the 13th consecutive year and, if earnings estimates are correct for 2024, it will deliver again next year. Dividends have also grown consistently at a rate of approximately 6%.With an above-average dividend yield and mid-single-digit growth, the stock could be an attractive opportunity for investors seeking both high yield and decent levels of growth.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

To skip our detailed analysis of current recession concerns in the US and more, you can go directly to see the 5 Safe Stocks To Invest In.The Federal Reserve's July interest rate hike of 25 basis points that came on July 26 has brought inflation in the US up to levels of 5.25% to 5.5%. This is the highest inflation levels have been in the US in over 22 years, making the markets and investors worry about what more may lie ahead for them. Recession fears continue to plague the markets, with many investors worrying for their portfolios and rushing to pile their money into what is known as ""safe stocks,"" that is, those stocks that manage to stay in the green despite overall market conditions being far from ideal.What To Focus On After The Rate HikeWhile traditionally, the sectors that have managed to perform well in colder market conditions have included those like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, another trend we are seeing this year is an ongoing tech rally led primarily by large-cap tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). There are many reasons for this development, which include the rampant popularity of artificial intelligence for one. Considering this, investors should rest assured that while inflation may still be running high, they are not suffering from any lack of safe haven stocks that are continuing to battle on in a challenging financial environment.Stock performance in these sectors is also not the only thing to count on at this moment. After the Fed's decision to hike interest rates yet again, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also noted in a following press conference that the Fed will do everything in its power to bring inflation down again. Here are some comments Powell made at this press conference:""We're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. We're going to use our policy tools to get inflation under control. The implication is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down. In principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is that financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing and ultimately over time, we get where we need to go.""Story continuesThe Fed's Commitment To Lowering InflationIn a statement at the beginning of this press conference, Powell noted that the Fed remains committed to its long-term goal of bringing inflation down to 2%. While he did not offer any definitive statement on whether the markets should expect to see further rate hikes ahead in the year, he did note that US policymakers will be taking a ""meeting by meeting"" approach toward interest rates moving forward. All in all, Powell's statement and the following press conference indicate that while inflation is not expected to go down any time soon, the Fed is doing its utmost to bring it back down to more optimistic levels.In the meantime, investors are advised to focus their savings on safer options, such as high-risk, low-volatility stocks that have consistently performed well over the past few years. These include many large-cap companies that have made it to our list below and notably also include tech companies that have seemingly become more defensive investment options in 2023 in light of a sustained tech rally all through 2023. Names like the ones below can be considered to be safe stocks to buy for beginners in particular, and they most certainly are some of the top low-risk stocks to buy in the market this year. As such, our list below may act as a helpful guide for beginner investors looking for some of the most stable stocks out there today.13 Safe Stocks To Invest InOur MethodologyWe have selected stocks from sectors like consumer staples, healthcare, and technology since these sectors have proven to be safe historically and in 2023.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”7.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the most valuable industries, you can go directly to 10 Most Valuable Companies in the World by Market Cap.The most valuable companies in the world operate within various industries, including technology, energy, healthcare, financial services, and communication services. It is important to note that some of the technology and energy companies are listed as the biggest companies in the world by market cap. Many of these biggest companies have had to deal with a number of hurdles in the past few years, such as recessionary fears, overcoming the COVID-19 crisis, needs and demands of the employees, and the consequences of the war in Ukraine.In one of our previous articles, 25 largest energy companies by market cap, we discussed how the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused the global supply of fossil fuels to fall and demand to rise significantly, causing oil prices to surge. However, according to an article published by CNBC on March 3, new data shows that the war in Ukraine has actually helped the US oil and gas industry as the US became one of the biggest energy-exporting countries. The US exported an average ten million barrels a day during the four-week period, which ended on February 24.In addition to the energy sector, the information technology industry also ranks among the biggest industries in the world. In fact, some of the most valuable companies in our list, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), all belong to the technology sector. Let's discuss what the future of  the technology industry looks like before we move on to the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap.The Information Technology Sector on Track to Hit $12 Trillion By 2027Previously, the information technology industry had been subjected to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis. While the supply chain disruptions are back due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the industry is expected to continue growing in the long term. The information technology market was valued above $8.85 trillion in 2023, according to Research and Markets. The industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2023 through 2027, to reach a value of around $11.99 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.Story continuesThe technology industry has become one of the biggest industries in the world and has also perhaps been the most consequential over the last couple of decades. In the modern day, technology has changed the way we live our lives and consumer demand for more technology continues to rise.As an obvious consequence, technology companies rank among the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market cap. According to an article posted by Reuters on July 1, the market cap for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reached above the $3 trillion mark for the first time. This milestone follows the company’s launch of a mixed-reality headset.Moreover, the rising demand for tools powered by artificial intelligence as well as cloud computing services is expected to help boost the profits for technology companies. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appreciates the potential of both AI and cloud services as they offer their products and services, including Microsoft Azure which is their cloud computing platform, to some of the biggest enterprises around the world. Here are some comments from the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call:“We continue to focus on three priorities. First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas and expanding our TAM. And third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure.Azure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10x quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API and we are pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI's models.More broadly, we continue to see the world's largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all in on Azure this quarter in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra and Wolverine Worldwide, all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we are extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks.”On February 8, Reuters had reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be rolling out an AI chatbot to operate alongside Bing's search results, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) seeks to challenge Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google in search and browser technology.The AI war got ignited when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a hefty $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the company we all know from ChatGPT.While Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google was previously at a disadvantage with regards to generative AI, but favorable demand trends for AI tools caused the company to take a big step forward.

At the beginning of 2023, there was a resurgence in interest in AI stocks, overshadowing the previously favored dividend equities. However, the situation is about to change. Following the Federal Reserve's recent announcement about possible interest rate increases, investors are once again turning their attention to dividend-paying stocks as a means of generating cash.According to Refinitiv Lipper, dividend-paying stocks are experiencing investor interest as the $11.7 billion ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF received $33 million in net inflows during the two weeks ending on July 19. This marked the ETF's highest two-week gain since January. The fund tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more and has returned 7.5% so far this year. Fund managers are also giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks this year. In a recent poll conducted by BoFA Global Research, 44% of global fund managers expressed their expectation that high-dividend stocks would outperform low-dividend stocks. This figure indicates a significant nine-percentage-point increase compared to the previous month.Jurrien Timmer, a director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has now shifted his focus more toward financial and energy stocks. He believes that both sectors will experience positive outcomes due to what he anticipates will be an economic soft landing, avoiding a severe recession. Both the sectors are also showing a stable performance. This month, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector has risen by 5.7%, while the financials sector has increased by 5.6%. In comparison, the broader index has only gained 2.5%. In addition to this, the energy sector has paid steady dividends to shareholders over the past years. In one of our articles on dividend stocks, we reported that dividends in the energy sector have experienced significant growth, increasing by 401% since 2018. In contrast, the rest of the US market saw a dividend growth of 86% during the same period.Story continuesAlso read: 12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $25Though growth in dividend payouts has slowed in 2023, investors are turning to dividend-paying stocks as a means of achieving a total return.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) shareholders have enjoyed a 88% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 53% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 28% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 28% over one year. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity.

Reported EPS is $2.93, expectations were $2.75.Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's website. At this time, it's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and CEO for Union Pacific. Mr. Fritz, you may begin.Lance Fritz : Thank you, Rob, and good morning and welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today in Omaha are Kenny Rocker, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales; Eric Gehringer, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Jennifer Hamann, our Chief Financial Officer. We're also joined by our newly elected Independent Chair of the Board of Directors, Mike McCarthy, who will take a couple of minutes to address the announcements we made this morning regarding my successor and our Board. Mike, the floor is yours.Michael McCarthy : Thanks, Lance. This morning, the Board of Directors announced that Jim Vena will be appointed the next Chief Executive Officer of Union Pacific. The Board has also appointed Jim to the Board of Directors. Jim brings a strong rail operations background at Union Pacific with over 40 years of experience. This includes two successful years as our Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2020. After a comprehensive search process, it was clear Jim's track record of operating excellence was unparalleled and he was the right candidate for the job. Jim will start as CEO on August 14, and we look forward to welcoming him back to Union Pacific. The Board also announced that Beth Whited will be appointed President of Union Pacific.Beth has over 35 years of experience at our company and has held leadership roles across multiple departments. Recently, she has led our strategy, sustainability and workforce resource teams with great success. Going forward, the operations, finance, marketing and sales, supply chain and technology functions will report directly to Vena. Whited will report to Vena, and her responsibilities will include the strategy, workforce resources, sustainability, law, corporate relations and government affairs functions. In addition to these management changes, the Board is appointing two new Board members: Doyle Simons, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Weyerhaeuser; and John Wiehoff, former Chairman, President and CEO of C.H. Robinson.Story continuesBoth bring to our Board a wealth of skill sets, including operational expertise from leading large industrial public companies. As Lance indicated, as part of these changes, we are adopting a corporate governance best practice by splitting the role of company CEO and Board Chair. With my election, the Independent Chair, Director, Sheri Edison, will take over leadership of the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee. In addition, the Board has created a new committee, Safety and Service Quality, which will have responsibility to review, evaluate and monitor compliance with safety programs and provide oversight of the company's service performance. Director Jane Lute will lead this committee. The Board is very pleased to make these announcements today, which represent a continued commitment to Board refreshment to ensure that we have the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the company.We are confident that these new appointments set Union Pacific up for long-term value creation. Before I turn it back over to Lance, I would like to thank him for his leadership these past eight years. His accomplishments are many. And over the next few weeks, we will properly celebrate them. Most importantly, though, his leadership has set our company up for great success for the years to come. Thank you, Lance. And I'll turn it back over to you.Lance Fritz : Thanks, Mike. We appreciate your leadership throughout the process. And I'm pleased to welcome back Jim to Union Pacific, and I'm confident that the company has the right leaders to advance the hard work that's underway. Now let's turn to the business of the call and second quarter results. This morning, Union Pacific reported 2023 second quarter net income of $1.6 billion or $2.57 per share. This compares to 2022 second quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.93 per share. Our second quarter operating ratio of 63% was up 280 basis points versus 2022 primarily driven by lower revenue, inflationary pressures and the previously disclosed onetime ratification bonus payment. Throughout the quarter, we provided our customers with a more consistent and reliable service product while generally meeting the demand that was available to us.Eric will discuss in more detail the progress we've made, but the bottom line is that the actions we've taken to strengthen our crew resources are improving the railroad. We also acted during the quarter to increase the efficiency of our network by rightsizing our locomotive fleet using crews more efficiently and making sequential improvements in train length. We finished the quarter with our resources better aligned with current volumes. As you'll hear from Kenny, while several of our markets showed growth, consumer-facing markets remained soft and drove the volume decline. However, the strength of our business development efforts enabled us to mitigate the macro impact and outperform our peers. So let me turn it over to Kenny to provide more color on the business environment.Top 15 Railroad Companies in the Worldankush-minda-7KKQG0eB_TI-unsplashKenny Rocker: Thank you, Lance, and good morning. For the second quarter, volume was down 2% driven by weak market conditions in our premium and bulk business groups. Freight revenue declined 5% driven by lower fuel surcharges and a [2% decrease in volume. However, we generated solid core pricing gains in the quarter to help offset some of those challenges]. Let's take a closer look at each of these business groups. Starting with bulk. Revenue for the quarter was down 3% compared to last year, driven by a 2% decrease in average revenue per car due to lower fuel surcharges and a 1% decline in volume. Grain and grain products volume was up 1% due to increased demand and business wins for renewable diesel feedstocks, coupled with strong shipments of domestic grain.A soft U.S. export grain market partially offset these gains. Fertilizer carloads decreased by 9% in the quarter due to an outage at a customer facility that reduced export potash shipments. Food and refrigerated volume was down 8% due to reduced beer imports early in the quarter, but those shipments eventually improved by June. In addition, drought conditions from the prior growing season negatively impacted both fresh and can shipments. And lastly, coal and renewables volume was flat year-over-year. Low natural gas prices and reduced electricity demand from mild weather negatively impacted shipments, but that was offset by a favorable comparison to 2022. With our service improvements and additional resources, we are currently meeting available demand.Moving on to industrial. Industrial revenue was flat for the quarter driven by a 1% improvement in volume, offset by a 1% decline in average revenue per car. Core pricing gains in the quarter were offset by lower fuel surcharges and a negative mix in volume. Industrial chemicals and plastics volume was up 2% year-over-year, driven by increased plastic shipments, partially offset by lower industrial chemical shipments due to challenged industrial production levels and reduced housing demand. Metals and minerals volumes continue to deliver year-over-year growth. Volume was up 2% compared to last year primarily driven by growth in construction materials and increased frac sand shipments along with new business development wins. Forest products volume declined 13% year-over-year driven by challenging market conditions in housing and repair and remodel, coupled with lower corrugated box demand.However, energy and specialized shipments were up 2% versus last year driven by strong business development and increased demand for LPG and petroleum products. Turning to premium. Revenue for the quarter was down 11% on a 4% decrease in volume compared to last year. Average revenue per car decreased by 8%, reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenues. Automotive volumes were positively driven by continued strength in OEM production and inventory replenishment for finished vehicles and auto parts. Domestic intermodal wins were offset by a weak freight and parcel market driven by higher inventory and the shift in consumer behavior as people spend more towards services than goods. International shipments were down due to decreased imports on the West Coast.So turning to Slide 7. Here is our outlook for the rest of 2023 as we see it today. Starting with our bulk commodities. There is uncertainty in our second half coal outlook as the inventories have been restocked, but extreme heat is driving up near-term demand and starting to push up natural gas prices. We expect near-term grain shipment to be challenged with tighter U.S. grain supply impacting volumes. However, with improved operations and recent rain improving new crop supply forecast, we remain optimistic about our opportunity to move incremental grain carloads in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect our forecast for biofuel shipments of renewable diesel and their associated feedstocks to remain strong. We see solid market demand and continue to capture new business as production expands.Moving on to industrial. The forecast for industrial production is down in the back half of 2023. Demand for forest products will also remain below 2022 levels. And despite some good business development wins on the metal side, it has been offset by a weaker-than-expected market. However, we expect to see continued strength in construction with new business wins. And finally, for premium. We expect challenges in the intermodal market from continued inventory destocking, inflationary pressures and ongoing shift in consumer spending from goods to services. However, on the international side, we continue to outpace U.S. West Coast import market as customers shift more business to IPI. For automotive, we expect growth to continue driven by strong OEM production and high shippable ground count.So to wrap up, it's hard to say when the economy will begin to recover in certain sectors, but our diverse portfolio allows us to see positive momentum in many of our commodities. The team remains focused on winning new business and has a strong pipeline of opportunities with a great track record for closing deals. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric to review our operational performance.Eric Gehringer : Thank you, Kenny, and good morning. Starting on Slide 9. As always, safety remains job #1 at Union Pacific, and we are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities that we serve. Freight rail is the safest way to transport goods over land, and Union Pacific is doing its part to be even safer through ongoing investments in our network, employees, technology and communities. That is evidenced by our safety performance, which continues to show improvement. Through the first half of the year, our reportable derailment rate and personal injury rate both improved, a direct result of our enhanced training programs and strong safety culture of ownership and personal accountability.Now let's review our key performance metrics for the quarter, starting on Slide 10. This quarter, through the team's hard work, we made improvements both year-over-year and sequentially across key metrics that drive the customer experience. Freight car velocity improved 8% to 202 miles per day compared to the second quarter 2022. This improved fluidity and resiliency was on display as we exceeded 200 daily car miles for 10 consecutive weeks during the quarter. While the current business mix is a headwind, there remain opportunities for continued improvement. Trip plan compliance cites sizable 17 and 8-point year-over-year improvement in intermodal and manifest and auto TPC, respectively. Improved network fluidity as evidenced by faster freight car velocity, train velocity and lower terminal dwell drove those improvements.Turning to Slide 11 to review our network efficiency metrics. With the demand picture weaker, the team is taking action to right-size resources to align with current volumes. For example, beginning in April, we took actions to remove locomotives from our active fleet, storing around 200 units through the quarter. While there is still room for progress, locomotive productivity improved 2% both sequentially and year-over-year even as our gross ton miles declined 1%. Although greater crew availability is supporting solid service metrics, the impact of our hiring can be seen in our workforce productivity. To date, we have graduated approximately 1,200 TE&amp;Y employees and have a strong pipeline of nearly 775 in training. These higher workforce levels, coupled with weaker volumes, resulted in a 5% decline in workforce productivity.However, with more crew resources, we were able to lower recrew rates and reduce our borrow-outs by roughly half during the quarter. We continue to drive productivity with train length as evidenced by our sequential improvement of 2%. While down 1% year-over-year, this is good progress when you consider the headwinds soft intermodal was presented to our train length initiatives. There are many more opportunities ahead for improved efficiency of our railroad. From redeploying brake persons to improving fuel efficiency, growing train length and rightsizing our locomotive fleet, there is productivity to be captured. Wrapping up on Slide 12. The well-being and quality of life for our employees remains a top priority, and we continuously collect feedback, collaborate and look for solutions with our workforce.The historic agreements listed on Slide 12 represent results of our work together. Let's talk through each one of them in detail. Starting with paid sick leave. We now have ratified our tentative agreements with all 13 of our labor unions and this important quality-of-life initiative. The employee benefit is evident as they receive more paid time off to take care of themselves and their families. For the company, this definitely improves the attractiveness of our jobs but is additional labor expense that will need to be offset. Next, our crew consent agreement with SMART-TD provides greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to redeploy break or switch persons to work either in or outside the yard. More specifically, for our employees, it provides an expedited path for brake persons to become conductors and ultimately engineers if they so desire.For the company, it allows us to now reduce brake persons where the work does not require the third person, allowing us to partially offset short-term hiring demand. It also sets the stage to establish ground-based enhanced utility positions with fixed days off and greater certainty about their weekly assignments through scheduled shift work. Finally, TE&amp;Y work rest provides engineers and conductors with a more predictable work schedule, which enhances the quality of life for our employees and their families. Currently, we have a ratified agreement with our engineers that provides an 11 days on, 4 days off work schedule, and we are currently negotiating work rest with our conductors. For the company, this enables the railroad to better manage staffing levels as we receive a more predictable, available workforce.That reduces labor and failure costs, which combined support more consistent and reliable service, enabling long-term growth. We also believe it will improve our retention rate, reducing hiring expenses and loss productivity. Now these agreements come with a cost, which Jennifer will detail more later. As we implement them, we expect a larger training pipeline in the near term as well as elevated workforce levels in the future. When fully implemented, our current forecast is an additional 400 to 600 employees. Ultimately, the long-term benefit of these agreements is the positive impact on our employees and the service we provide for our customers. That enhanced service product will allow us to win in the marketplace. So to close, I would like to express my appreciation to both our customers for their support and the marketing and sales team for their continuous work to capture available demand and win in the new -- win new business.With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to review our financial performance.Jennifer Hamann : Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Let me start with a look at the walk-down of our second quarter operating ratio and earnings per share on Slide 14, where we've outlined the major drivers. In the June 13 8-K, we disclosed a onetime ratification payment related to our SMART-TD brake person agreement. That $67 million bonus increased our operating ratio 110 basis points and reduced our EPS $0.09. Falling fuel prices during the quarter and the lag on our fuel surcharge recovery programs positively impacted our operating ratio 200 basis points and added $0.04 to EPS. While improved operations generally allowed us to meet demand during the quarter, that demand was softer and the combination of an elevated training pipeline, inflation and negative mix, all impacted our core results.Below the line, we net to a $0.07 EPS reduction from lower Nebraska State tax rates in 2023, as was noted in that same June 8-K, and a large 2022 real estate sale. Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15. Operating revenue totaled $6 billion, down 5% versus last year on a 2% year-over-year volume decline. Included in that is a $34 million reduction in accessorials related to lower intermodal volume and faster equipment turns. Operating expense of $3.8 billion was flat resulting in second quarter operating income of $2.2 billion, which is down 12% versus last year. Other income decreased $70 million driven by the 2022 real estate sale I mentioned earlier. Interest expense increased 7%, reflecting higher debt levels. Net income of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 2022, which when combined with share repurchases, resulted in a 12% decrease in earnings per share to $2.57.Now looking more closely at our second quarter revenue. Slide 16 provides a breakdown of our freight revenue, which totaled $5.6 billion, down 5% versus 2022. Lower year-over-year volume reduced revenue 175 basis points. Total fuel surcharge revenue of $707 million was $269 million less versus last year. The impact of falling fuel prices as well as the lag in our surcharge programs reduced freight revenues 425 basis points. The combination of price and mix in the quarter increased freight revenue 150 basis points. This gain reflects the strong pricing we secured while also recognizing some headwinds from certain coal and intermodal contracts where the pricing is more reflective of current market conditions. Mix in the quarter remained negative as fewer lumber shipments and more short-haul rock shipments outweighed the positive impact of lower intermodal.Turning now to Slide 17 and a look at second quarter operating expenses, which totaled $3.8 billion. Compensation and benefits expense increased $177 million versus 2022 with nearly 40% of that amount reflecting the brake person agreement. Second quarter workforce levels increased to 4%. Although total transportation employees were up 7%, the active TE&amp;Y workforce is only up 1%, which is a result of our robust hiring and elevated training pipeline. Excluding the impact of the onetime bonus payment, cost per employee increased 5% in the second quarter, and we expect it to be up 3% to 4% for the full year. Both second quarter and full year cost per employee reflect the impact of that larger training pipeline as well as better crew efficiency, which are partially offsetting wage inflation.I'll provide more details on the impact of our new agreements here in just a bit. Fuel expense in the quarter increased 29% on a 29% decrease in fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% driven by inflation, partially offset by decreased subsidiary drayage expense and more moderate locomotive repair expenses as we stored locomotives in the quarter. Equipment and other rents was up 8%, reflecting higher lease expense for new freight cars secured to support business volumes and lower equity income, slightly offset by lower car hire as we improve cycle times and move less volume. Other expense grew 6%, primarily related to increased environmental remediation accruals as well as persistently elevated casualty costs. Turning to Slide 18 and our cash flows.Cash from operations in the first half of 2023 decreased to $3.9 billion from $4.2 billion in 2022. The primary driver was $445 million of payments related to labor union agreement. These payments also impacted free cash flow and our cash flow conversion rate. Year-to-date, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 200 -- excuse me, to 2022 levels at 2.9x as we continue to be A-rated by our three credit agencies. Wrapping up on Slide 19. As you've heard from the team, we're pleased that the service product is enabling us to meet available demand. Unfortunately, as you heard from Kenny, consumer-facing markets like intermodal and lumber remains soft.Additionally, the outlook for coal has weakened since the start of the year but with some near-term opportunities given the extreme heat. Although we still expect to outpace industrial production in certain markets, weak demand for consumer goods has pushed our full year volume outlook below current industrial production estimates, which are slightly positive. Unchanged is our expectation to generate pricing dollars in excess of inflation dollars. To date, we've made great progress repricing our business to reflect the impact of higher inflation, and that momentum will continue. As it relates to fuel prices, I should point out that the tailwind we've experienced these past 24 months is now expected to shift to a headwind both on the operating ratio and EPS front.Assuming fuel prices remain relatively stable, this will likely represent a negative second half impact of around $0.50 per share. Eric provided some great context on our labor agreements. And although they clearly come with some upfront cost, we see opportunities as well. Starting with the sick leave agreements. Our current forecast is that they will add roughly $50 million to labor expense in the second half of 2023, which is reflected in the cost per crew numbers I quoted earlier. We view these costs as added inflationary pressures that we will reflect in our pricing. For the brake person agreement, we've already seen the impact of that upfront payment. Our expected payback period is roughly two years as it allows us to redeploy crew personnel, save on costly borrow-out positions as well as reduce our current hiring needs.Implementation of the BLET work rest agreement will start over the next month or so with completion likely in 2024. For this year, we estimate the work rest implementation will cost upwards of $20 million. The challenge in putting a finer point on that estimate is both timing and forecasting employee behavior. We don't yet have an agreement with SMART-TD, and we are still working through some technology and logistics before we start the rollout. And while we certainly expect better availability, better service and more flexibility with our crew boards, providing more access to time off likely adds employees and expense. The exact math depends on how employees utilize this greater flexibility as well as how we translate better predictability into increased levels of productivity and service that ultimately drive profitable growth on our railroad.Looking at our 2023 capital allocation. Our capital plan remains $3.6 billion. We also plan to maintain our current dividend of $1.30 per quarter as reflected in our dividend announcement this morning. However, we have paused share repurchases and don't expect to be back in the market for the remainder of 2023. While there's no change to our long-term capital allocation strategy, which is first dollar into the business, industry-leading dividend payment and excess cash to shares, we recognize our cash flows are impacted in the current environment with volumes and costs. Wrapping up, we are well positioned to operate a better railroad in the second half of 2023 and for the long term, our strong fundamentals are unchanged and will allow us to generate significant value for our owners as team UP drives service, growth and improved profitability.So with that, I'll turn it back to Lance.Lance Fritz : Thank you, Jennifer. As you've heard from the team, the first half of this year has been about laying a foundation for future success. Key to that foundation is safety and the quality of life of our employees, and I'm pleased with the progress we've been making on both those fronts. As you heard from Eric, we continue to make the railroad safer, while improvements in our safety metrics are critical. More encouraging are the positive strides we're making in our safety culture. The team has great momentum across our safety programs, which gives me great pride as I step away. I'm also encouraged by the progress we've made to address quality-of-life issues with our craft professionals, reaching historic labor agreements around paid sick leave, crew redeployment and scheduled work.These agreements drive employee engagement and productivity to produce a better service product for our customers. As I wrap up time as CEO of Union Pacific, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to the Board and shareholders of UP for giving me the privilege of leading the company for the past eight years. I'm proud of how the team has positioned Union Pacific to thrive for the years ahead, and I'm pleased to say that we provided great value all along the way. Union Pacific is truly a special place. It's full of hard-working, dedicated railroaders who embrace the daily task of Building America. It's been my greatest honor to lead this team. Their commitment to be the best for our communities, our customers, our investors and for each other is remarkable.160-plus years of success began and continues with our exceptional employees. I can't wait to see what they accomplish next.Jennifer Hamann : Thank you, Lance. And on behalf of the employees of Union Pacific, let me offer our gratitude and appreciation for your leadership. We wish nothing but the best for you and your family as you embark on the next chapter. Before we begin Q&amp;A, I'd like to lay out a couple of guidelines for the call. In the interest of time and to accommodate everyone, please limit yourself to one question and one question only. Second, we understand that there's great interest in the leadership changes that were announced this morning, and we look forward to those discussions. However, today's call is to discuss our quarterly results. So please focus your questions on the business of the earnings call. So with that, Rob, we are ready for your first question.See also 12 Out of Favor Stocks That Hedge Funds Love and 10 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Buy For The AI Boom.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.Story continuesJames M. CracchioloGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, Ameriprise overall delivered a strong second quarter to round at a very good first half. Given our complement of businesses, we consistently generate good returns and strong earnings. Advice &amp; Wealth Management continues to lead our growth where we had another quarter of solid client engagement and flows. We also saw good earnings from our bank, reflecting our ability to create a sustainable and attractive revenue stream in this interest rate environment.In our Asset Management business, we continue to experience headwinds in this environment and remain focused on adjusting appropriately. In terms of the market environment, the S&amp;P 500 international equity markets have rallied more recently through the end of July. However, they were only up 2% year-over-year on average for the quarter. Fixed income markets remain unfavorable, particularly in Europe. While inflation has come down, it's still above the Fed's targeted rate. As we saw yesterday, the Fed increased 25 basis points and said it would continue to assess additional information in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return to a 2% inflation rate. With that as a backdrop, Ameriprise continues to benefit from our diversified business mix as well as higher interest rates in our bank and certificate companies. Assets under management and administration increased nicely, up 9% to $1.3 trillion, reflecting our organic growth and positive markets. Total adjusted operating net revenue was up 10% to $3.8 billion. The combination of strong revenue growth, particularly from our spread business as well as well-managed expenses drove earnings to $807 million, up 23% with EPS up 30% to $7.44. And our return on equity was outstanding and reached a new record of 51%, a level that few financial firms have achieved. Now let's turn to business highlights. In Wealth Management, we delivered another excellent quarter as we serve clients well with gold-based device and deliver a highly satisfying experience. We continue to drive very good asset growth with total client assets up to $833 billion and total client flows of $9.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our client acquisition growth was also strong, especially in the $500,000 to $5 million client range. This is an area where we consistently had good momentum, and it's a key growth opportunity for us. We're leveraging our strategic investments to help advisers engage clients and prospects provide a great client experience and run highly successful and efficient practices. Our fully integrated technology suite streamlines many of our advisers administrative tasks and frees up their time to go deeper with clients and to navigate the complexities within their financial situations. For example, we introduced an important capability that enables advisers to generate highly personalized presentations centered on client goal achievement. Since the launch, it has helped to build on our already strong client satisfaction net flows and practice growth for our advisers who are incorporating it into their practices. And it's reduced meeting prep time as much as 70%, and allows more time for client acquisition. We're also beginning to use AI and analytics to further enhance how we engage and work with clients. With AI, we can serve up real-time information to help advisers identify a possible next best opportunity for clients based on their needs. Backed by our exceptional support, adviser satisfaction, retention and growth are all excellent. Ameriprise advisers consistently have some of the highest productivity growth in the business. In the second quarter, it increased nicely again, up 7% to $874,000 per adviser. We're also incorporating the use of data and analytics in how we identify productive advisers who are a good fit to recruit to the firm and more likely to make the switch. It was another strong quarter for recruitment with the addition of 99 experienced advisers. We're consistently bringing in large, highly productive adviser practices from across the industry. In the spring, I spent time with our top 10% of advisers, both tenured at Ameriprise and more recently experienced advisers who have joined us. They repeatedly shared that our advanced capabilities and technology combined with our excellent leadership coaching and marketing support gives them a tremendous advantage in how they serve clients and run successful practices. They are very proud to affiliate with Ameriprise and energized about the direction of the company and the opportunities in front of us. During the quarter, clients remain cautious seeking yield as they continue to maintain higher balances in cash-oriented products. Cash continued to increase as clients continue to hold cash, and we ended the quarter with about $70 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Wrap assets under management increased 14% to over $450 billion, reflecting positive flows and market appreciation that occurred at the end of the quarter. The more recent increase in markets will be a benefit as we go through the quarter. For the first time since the beginning of the year, we saw signs in June that clients are starting to move some funds back into the market. which brings me to the bank, Ameriprise Bank continues to perform well with assets growing to nearly $22 billion. It's a strong complement to our business and an attractive way to gain spread revenue in this rate environment. Bank and certificate balances grew over 50% to $33 billion. The cash balances in these accounts are very rational today, and we feel comfortable with our position. We will continue to build out our banking capabilities and are in the process of introducing other savings products later this year. This will help advise us further deepen client relationships and bring in more assets from other banking institutions. With our latest research, in addition to our core client segments, we found that the Ameriprise value proposition and brand are very appealing to high net worth investors as well as millennials who are hungry for advice and seeking guidance from advisers who truly understand them and their priorities. These are market segments we're looking to serve more in the future. And this was also reinforced by the complement of external accolades and recognition we continue to earn. The way we work with clients defines Ameriprise, and I believe our reputation is a competitive advantage. During the quarter, Ameriprise was named by Kiplinger's Readers as the overall winner in the wealth management category. We earned the highest ratings for each of the 4 criteria, the trustworthiness of our advisers, the quality of financial advice provided, the likeliness to recommend the firm to others and we earned the highest rating in overall satisfaction. Ameriprise also ranked on Newsweek's Magazine 2023 most trustworthy companies in America list for the second consecutive year. And we earned top performer recognition and understands me and shares my values from Hearts &amp; Wallets. And speaking of values, Ameriprise culture is another very important positive. Advisers who have joined us with decades in the business tell us that our company is unique and not like any other they've been part of. They're impressed by things like our supportive growth culture and their accessibility to senior leadership. Finally, in terms of profitability for Wealth Management, it was another strong quarter across the board, and that includes margin, which reached a new record of 31.2%. Moving to Retirement &amp; Protection. We have high-quality, well risk managed books, and we're generating strong consistent earnings of 13%, driven by the repositioning of our investment portfolio last year given the rate climate. Our free cash flow and return on capital remain excellent. The team is concentrated on accumulation products that align with our clients' needs and the business. In our life business, we're focused on our variable universal life and disability products that are appropriate for this environment. Protection sales were up nicely, increasing 18% with the majority of sales in higher-margin accumulation VUL products. And in variable annuities, our structured product continues to attract strong interest combining with our variable annuities without living benefits. Sales are down from a year ago, in part due to the decision to exit guarantees. Here again, we're using intelligent document processing and robotics to make processes more efficient, things like automating our processes and underwriting decisions. We're seeing the benefit and the pickup in sales. As we discussed, we feel good about our product portfolio, both for clients and the business, which consistently delivers good returns. Moving to Asset Management. As you know, we manage the business prudently, like other active managers, we're facing reduced flows in this environment. The business continues to operate well and generates good fees, and we're adjusting for headwinds accordingly. In terms of investment performance, we continue to have excellent longer-term performance in equities, fixed income and asset allocation strategies with over 75% of our funds above the medium for the 5-year and over 85% for the 10-year period. Our 1-year performance has improved across the board. This includes some of our larger franchises, including in U.K. equities, where we're benefiting from our quality positioning and in fixed income given our strength in credit. In terms of flows, I'll start with global retail, where we continue to experience a level of outflows. In North America, we remain in net outflows, but we had nice improvement in fixed income. In fact, we are better than the industry and taxable bond. Meanwhile, we continue to see outflow pressures in equities, largely from lower gross sales as redemptions have improved. We continue to focus our adviser segmentation strategy to drive good engagement in North America. In EMEA, retail flows in both the U.K. and Continental Europe remain under pressure. However, in institutional, we were in net inflows, excluding legacy insurance partner flows as we garnered nice wins in high yield and investment-grade credit that more than offset large redemptions and LDI strategies given the market dislocation. Now I'd like to give you a brief update on our EMEA acquisition and executing the integration in Europe. I wanted you to know that it does take time due to the complexity of the legal entity structures as well as regulatory and employment considerations. We made it through a number of important steps, and we have now moved to the next level of consolidation including the colocation of our teams through our existing real estate and the near completion of some of the major technology migration work. Given the environment, we're taking a very focused look across the business globally to further reduce expenses, this includes identifying and stopping less growth-driven activities and also redeploying resources where we see opportunities to support our margin. In summary, we're controlling what we can control and making the necessary changes to adjust in this environment. Reflecting on the firm overall, Ameriprise delivered a strong first half of the year, and we're well positioned to continue to navigate and grow. Our complement of businesses provides nice contributions and synergies. We consistently generate good appropriate earnings in total and good cash flow to invest and return to shareholders at attractive levels. We returned $638 million of earnings to shareholders in the quarter, which represented nearly 80% of our earnings. In addition, as you saw, our Board approved a new $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization that reflects the strength of the business. Across the firm, we continue to make good investments in our businesses. And as always, we are sharply focused on execution. And while we manage expenses very well, we will be looking for additional expense opportunities as we move into 2024 to adjust to the environment. From a people perspective, our team is highly engaged. In fact, in the quarter, Forbes Magazine named Ameriprise one of America's best large employers. The list ranks the 500 U.S. companies most highly recommended as a top place to work. With that, I'll turn things over to Walter provide his perspective in more detail on the quarter, and then we'll take your questions.Walter S. BermanThank you. As Jim said, results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition as adjusted EPS increased 30% to $7.44. Results reflect wealth management core and cash business momentum as well as continued expense discipline. In total, our Wealth Management business grew to 68% of the company's earnings, up from 56% a year ago as a result of a 49% growth in Wealth Management earnings. Asset management-based headwinds similar to the industry in terms of flows and fixed income market declines. And Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions delivered good 13% earnings growth primarily from our decision to reposition the investment portfolio late last year. Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment. While we continue to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives, particularly in wealth management, we are taking a disciplined approach on discretionary expenses across our businesses. Scooting mark-to-market impacts on share-based compensation expense G&amp;A was up only 4%. However, G&amp;A in the first half of 2022 was unusually low as a result of the pandemic. Our G&amp;A expenses remain on track with our expectations. Balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our portfolio is well positioned. Our hedging remains highly effective, and we have strong capital and liquidity positions. This allowed us to return $638 million of capital to shareholders as a strong return of 79% of our operating earnings. Let's turn to Slide 6. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, up 9% AUM/A benefited from strong client flows and equity market appreciation, partially offset by lower fixed income markets. Revenue growth was strong at 10% from higher interest earnings and cumulative benefit of client net inflows. With average equity markets up only 2%. The impact of 6% equity market appreciation in June will be reflected in our third quarter AWM results given the ability of our wrap business is based on beginning of the month balances. Pretax earnings increased 24% from last year. with meaningful benefits from strong client flows, higher interest rates and well-managed expenses. Let's turn to individual segment performance beginning with Wealth Management on Slide 7. The Wealth Management client assets increased 13% to $833 billion driven by strong organic growth and client flows along with higher equity markets. As you are aware, there has been significant volatility since Q1 of 2022, which we have navigated well. Our client and wrap assets have remained consistent with our industry peers over this period. Our client flows continue to be strong at $9.4 billion, up 10% from last year. Client money has gone into a combination of wrap and non-advisory accounts as clients continue to be in a defensive posture. Our flexible model and broad offerings allow advisers and clients to pivot as market and client preferences shift. While the money stays within the system gives us potential upside going forward. Revenue per adviser reached $874,000 in the quarter, up 7% from the prior year from high spread revenue, enhanced productivity and business growth.Turning to Slide 8. I'd like to provide an update on client cash levels. Our client cash balances comprised of cash sweep and certificates have returned to more historic levels at $42 billion, which translates to about 5% of total client assets. The financial benefit from cash remains unchanged despite a lower volume of cash as we have seen a significant lift in the interest rate earned at the bank and certificate business. Our fee yields have increased nearly 350 basis points from a year ago and picked up 40 basis points sequentially, resulting in very strong interest earnings growth. I would like to note that we continue to see new money flows into money markets and brokered CDs, albeit at a lower level in June, which brought our total cash level to $70 billion. This creates a significant redeployment opportunity as markets normalize for clients to put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform. While there is some seasonality with cash levels, particularly with tax payments in March and April, cash remains an important component of the client's asset allocation. Like others in the industry, balances are stabilized. Our sweep cash has an average size of $7,000 per account, and 65% of the aggregate cash is now in accounts under $100,000. And we have seen a very limited movement out of these accounts. In the quarter, we moved approximately $1 billion from off balance sheet cash on to the bank's balance sheet. We continue to evaluate the opportunity to bring additional balances onto the bank balance sheet as we move forward. Lastly, we continue to manage our investment portfolios prudently. Our bank portfolio is AAA rated with the 3.4-year duration. The overall yield on the portfolio is 4.6% and rising with the new money yield on investments in the second quarter of 6%. Our certificate company portfolio is highly liquid with over half of the portfolio in cash, governments and agencies. It is AA+ rated on average with a 1-year duration. As I noted last quarter, the portfolio yield lagged decline crediting rates as new money moved into this business. This quarter, the portfolio yield increased 33 basis points. In total, certificate company portfolio is now yielding 5.5%, with new purchases in the quarter at that level as well. On Slide 9, we delivered extremely strong results in wealth management on all fronts. Profitability increased 49% in the quarter, with strong organic growth and the benefit of the higher interest rates. Pretax operating margin reached a new high of 31.2%, up 730 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned before, the benefit from the June market appreciation of over 6% will be a tailwind for quarter 3 results given we build our wrap business based on the beginning of the month balances. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% with distribution expenses up 1%, reflecting higher asset balances. Consistent with our expectations, G&amp;A is up 9% in the quarter. This is off a very low base last year given the impact of the pandemic, and we continue to make investments for growth. We expect AWM full year 2023 G&amp;A growth to be in the mid-single digits. Let's turn to Asset Management on Slide 10. We are managing the business well through a challenging environment that is impacting the industry. Total AUM increased 3% to $617 billion, primarily from higher equity markets, partially offset by lower fixed income markets. Asset management, like other active managers, was in outflows in the quarter. Reinvested dividends were $2 billion lower in the current quarter. However, underlying net new sales were fairly consistent to last year. Like others, we experienced pressure from global market volatility and a risk of investor sentiment. Investment performance has been another critical area of focus and we are seeing improvement, including in fixed income strategies. Overall, 5- and 10-year performance remains very strong. And as Jim said, we had improvement in the 1-year numbers. On Slide 11, you can see asset management financial results reflecting the market environment. As anticipated, earnings declined to $162 million as a result of deleveraging, net outflows and lower performance fees in the quarter. The margin was down sequentially to 30%. Importantly, we continue to manage the areas we can control. Expenses remain well managed. Total expenses declined 2% and with G&amp;A up only 2%. As Jim said, given the environment, we are taking a very focused look across the business globally to further reduce expenses. This includes identifying and stopping less growth-focused activities and redeploying resources where we can see an opportunity to support our margin. Let's turn to Slide 12. Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation, reflecting the high quality of the business. In the quarter, Pretax adjusted operating earnings was $189 million, up 13% from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher investment yields from the portfolio repositioning we executed last year. However, earnings in the current year were unfavorably impacted by $7 million from a model update resulting from a system conversion and timing of earnings recognition for payout annuities, which is expected to normalize. We continue to view normalized annual earnings of $800 million as a reasonable expectation for this business. Overall sales declined 10% related to our decision to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefit riders a year ago. However, protection sales improved and remain concentrated in high-margin acid accumulation VUL, which now represents over 1/3 of the total insurance in force. Now let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 13. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our diversified high-quality investment portfolio remains well positioned. In total, the average credit rating of the portfolio was AA with only 1% of the portfolio and below investment-grade securities. VA hedge effectiveness remained very strong at 98%. Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions from all of the business segments. This supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $638 million to shareholders and still ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of excess capital and $2.1 billion of holding company available liquidity. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to shareholders and announced a new $3.5 billion share repurchase authorization through September 30, 2025. With that, we'll take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now begin the question-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.Alexander BlosteinMaybe we could start with a question on AWM. I want to zone in on kind of the interplay between net new asset growth, Jim, that you talked about in cash. So to your point, capital, obviously sitting in the sidelines and money market fund treasuries and as Fed funds peaks, it's likely that some of that cash is going to make it way into investment products. So what are your expectations for AWM net new asset growth into the second half particularly with an advisory. And then at the same time, do you think any of that reallocation of cash could put incremental pressure on the $30 billion of brokerage sweep balances, which I think were down about 10% sequentially or are they pretty kind of troughy sort of at operational levels at this point. So as part of that, maybe just an update on kind of where that $30 billion sits in July as well.James M. CracchioloOkay. So Alex, I think we've continued to have very good client flows quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, they were up 10% from last year. But remember, in the second quarter, you always have some adjustment because of tax payments. So if you look at even where we had some of the cash sorting in the second quarter, a significant amount was due to those tax payments coming out in April. And that also then hits your client net flows on a consistent basis like the cash.Having said that, I would say we continue to see that client flow activity being good. Our client engagement is good. But to the point you just referenced that we mentioned, consistent level has gone more into cash as a holding because of the current yield, right? Now this market has maintained itself a bit better than people expected. I think there was a surprise. Now how the market has climbed so much. Now it's starting to broaden a bit rather than just based on a few stocks. And so if that does continue, and there's a settlement in a sense of even fixed income yields feeling like they're not going to continue to rise at this point. There might be a shift back as we're beginning to see into fixed income products other than cash for a longer duration as well as in equities. And so now where does that money come from, our belief is that we've never held this amount of cash balances before, right? And so $70 billion is up to like 9% of our total assets here. And some of that will come back from those positional cash areas. Regarding the sweep per se, we all hold a certain level of cash in those accounts because of usage just like a checking account and certain things like that. So we're not thinking that a large amount or the significant amount will come back. In fact, we see the cash sorting slowing as we go into -- down through the beginning of the third quarter here. And so my belief is that it will come more from position of cash. And because of the size of the balances we're maintaining. Now I can't -- I don't have a perfect crystal ball, but when money comes back in, then more is actually held in a sweep for transactional activity that occurs. So that's really how we're thinking.Alexander BlosteinI got you. That's helpful. Any update on where that $30 billion is in July, just tactically?Walter S. BermanWell, in July, yes, we saw -- it has slowed the way we anticipated, we're just observing now, but we feel comfortable with the slowing that we're seeing.Alexander BlosteinOkay. Great. And then my second question, just around the asset management dynamics that you described. Obviously, it sounds like you're adjusting the expense base to the sort of headwinds we're seeing across the industry. I mean, maybe put a little more granularity about kind of what that means? What are your expectations for G&amp;A growth within the asset management business for the second half, and it sounds like that will continue into 2024. And I guess bigger picture, flows a challenge that's been the story for some time. But the markets, to your point earlier, upright, so the revenue base could actually grow despite the flow challenges. How does that inform this quarter kind of G&amp;A reallocation dynamics? Could G&amp;A be sort of flat to down even in that scenario or the upward market will just naturally put some pressure on the cost base.James M. CracchioloYes. So what we're really focused on is -- and I think if you looked at the second quarter, G&amp;A was actually down 2%, but because of the share price appreciation and the plans, et cetera, it ended up 2%, but the underlying was actually down. And we expect that to continue. And we're taking a much more concerted effort now that we've gone through some of the major integration activities that we had to do in Europe even though that's not complete. Now we can take a more holistic view of our global expense base, which we are across all areas. And we think there is some good opportunity for us to really target for a reduction in expenses as we move forward and through 2024, and that's really our focus.OperatorNext question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.Brennan HawkenI'd like to start on the pending Comerica deal. So could we get an update there? Are the assets still around $18 billion? Or has that changed due to market tailwinds or otherwise? And is this base of assets similar to other bank deals that we've seen where there's more of a bias to brokerage than advisory and -- or cash allocations kind of similar to what you have in AWM.Walter S. BermanSo it's Walter. As it relates to Comerica, it's still on track and the activity levels and certainly the assets that we announced at the -- when we made -- consummate the arrangement is on track also. And it's characterization, yes, cash is a component, but it is within the ranges of the transaction. So we feel very comfortable with it, and we're targeting for the fourth quarter.Brennan HawkenOkay. So has it really changed from where...Walter S. Berman(inaudible).Brennan HawkenGot it, perfect. Okay. And then have you -- as we start to see the sort of fluid environment and the forward look for rates and the potential for lower rates as we move into 2024. Maybe I was hoping for an update on the maturity profile of the CDs within the certificate company? And how are you thinking about managing those balances and maybe either pulling back on rate or leaning in, depending on the outlook and the idea that some of those rates and that funding would be locked in a potentially declining rate environment?Walter S. BermanSo if you mentioned certificate, I would probably focus more on the bank because the bank is really where we have now the advantage of investing and having duration. As you've seen our yield right now is 4.6%. We certainly see that increasing as we have maturities and other things. So we feel quite comfortable that as the environment, I don't know where it's going to go up. I don't know it's going to go down, stay the same, but we are well positioned to have that stability of earnings there and that the yield that we see at the bank, which is the majority of where we've gone out under -- for investing will prevail as we look over the near term. So we're in a very good position from that standpoint.Brennan HawkenYes. No, I totally appreciate that, and I hear you. I was more thinking about managing on the cost side of it.James M. CracchioloOn certificate side, as we would say, we sort of match us sort of like based on the yield we provide for those things. So we sort of look to sort of keep a certain spread on that based on when they -- the money coming in or where we look at it when it's matured.Walter S. BermanYes. And the spread, as I indicated, increased because, obviously, where our investments are catching up with the rate, and it's short duration is 1 year. So from that standpoint, we will adjust it both from the rate crediting rate and certainly our investments, but we feel very confident with the spread there as it's incorporated.Brennan HawkenRight. And the spread is durable in both declining environments as well as rising environments.Walter S. BermanYes, it certainly. We'll maintain a certain degree of spread. But obviously, just as rates go up and down.OperatorThe next question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.Erik James BassFor Asset Management, do you still think at 31% to 35% margin is the right target to think about near term? And given the expense actions you've talked about as well as the benefit from rising markets. Do you think you could get back to that level in the second half of this year?James M. CracchioloYes. I can't -- listen, I can't predict the third quarter per se, but we're not changing that targeted rate, and we definitely believe that we can be within that targeted rate. I can't tell you about a quarter. But I would probably say, yes, we feel comfortable with that as we go to the second half, but into '24.Erik James BassPerfect. And then can you update us on the plans to launch a brokered CD product and any other bank products for the second half of the year and what your expectations are for the type of assets that those could attract.James M. CracchioloYes. So we did soft launched a brokered CD in the second quarter, and that's starting to take hold here. We also put out a base savings product. Again, that's beginning to take hold. And we have plans for the third -- the end of the third quarter to actually put some incentives type activity there to bring in new cash from outside the firm. .And also a preferred type of savings product in the fourth quarter. So we're sort of getting how they are positioned on the platform and then how we sort of rolled that out from soft launches, et cetera. But yes, we will have a set of those type of savings products as we go through the rest of the year into next year. We will then target to bring in more cash externally.Erik James BassAnd how would you sort of tier the margin expectation on that relative to the other cash products or certificates?James M. CracchioloSo what I would say, first of all, you got to separate the suite, which is a different animal from various savings products, but I'll let Walter...Walter S. BermanThe margin, as we have certainly a reserve count that at search and the margin in the bank is similar. It's a little harder, but the margin is good. And then we're competitive on each one of the products as we look at the CD and obviously, the rates there are certainly being driven by regional banks and others, but we will remain competitive. But the margins there are lower as you would expect. (inaudible).OperatorThe next question is from Suneet Kamath with Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathJust going back to the bank for a second. So our understanding is that you'll have, I think, $1.4 billion of assets sort of maturing and rolling into new assets in the second half and then a similar amount in the first half of next year. So would it be possible to get sort of the current yields on those assets just so we can kind of think through when that reinvestment occurs, how much upside you guys would have?Walter S. BermanYes. I would say, you're right. It will probably -- you saw (inaudible) 4, 6 range. With that, we're getting in the ranges 5 -- high 5s, low 6s. And so that should go up. Yes, I can't tell you where rates are going to be. But if it's great to stay where they are, actually move around 50 basis points -- 40, 50 basis points by the end of the year.Suneet Laxman L. KamathSo you're saying an incremental 40 to 50 basis points?Walter S. BermanIt's around 5%.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. Okay. And then I guess...Walter S. BermanI just want to clarify that since rates stay the way they are today, okay? And spread.Suneet Laxman L. KamathYes. Got it. Okay. And then I guess you're talking about this now $70 billion cash number. And I think last quarter, that was maybe $60 billion. Obviously, there's a portion of that, that you guys have kind of in that $42 billion range. So as we think about that incremental $28 billion, I know some of that's in other companies' products, but what's a reasonable expectation in terms of how much of those assets you guys think you could ultimately have in your own products?James M. CracchioloSo I think what I would say is I think good amount could come back, but not just into our own savings type products, but more importantly, into the wrap type of business again. If you recollect before the sort of period where people got a little more concerned, we had roughly a majority of our client flows going into wrap. And so I believe right now, we're at a sort of a low point of the amount of cash being deployed into wrap. And I do believe part of that went to positional cash. And that position of cash will start to come in. And remember, I think the investments in fixed income is much lower than it's been in a long time because of the yields going up on the duration and people not wanting to get whipsawed. And so that money will come back in, and that does go into wrap accounts as well because it's more of a balanced portfolio that they utilize.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. And then if I could just sneak one more in. Jim, I thought your comment about high net worth and millennial opportunities sounded like it was new. Is that an opportunity something that you can attack sort of organically? Or are there capabilities that you'd need to acquire in order to capitalize on that growth opportunity?James M. CracchioloNo, Suneet. We're already -- for instance, we're already bringing high net worth clients nicely. But we have not made that a more concerted effort in the franchise yet. But now we are putting more deploying around that. And we do have most of the capabilities, if not all of them. I mean there's always some bells and whistles we add, but we have added to a product platform, our alternative platform, et cetera. We have now -- and the advice part of what we have actually worked very well for high net worth clients. And what we found is when we did our research that we are considered up there for high net worth clients or prospects similar to any of the private houses out there that cater to them or the major wire houses that cater to them. So we don't have a disadvantage there and it's one that we're building out the focus of our advisers to really understand and see that so that they can target it more. And then on the millennial side, we've made a lot of investments in our digital capabilities and the engagement way of doing that we will also be really starting to focus more on for bringing in younger clients either through some of the younger advisers we bring, but more even direct in some of our things because we have remote channel set up to work with clients that way. And so I feel very good about those opportunities, giving us further expansion efforts.OperatorThe next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.Michael Anthony AnagnostakisIt's Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. I just wanted to circle back to the rate sensitivity picture here. I guess given the shape of the curve. Maybe you could provide some updated color on your rate sensitivity. Can you help us size the impact to your earnings from rate cuts on the static balance sheet? And how do you expect your deposit betas to differ on the way down versus the way up given your certificate percentage and low-cost sweep deposits funding the bank.Walter S. BermanSo again, from the standpoint on rate going down, we do have. Since we are now having some substantial amounts in the bank, that would give us insulation from that standpoint for the portions that would be subject to short-term of the Fed fund reductions, that -- on that basis, you can imagine it's a straight calculation for every percentage going down. So it's factored into our analysis and we've seen the cycle going up and going down, but the mathematics are -- on that basis, we have $6 billion, $7 billion sitting in -- on off balance sheet. You can do the calculation on a 1% change. As it relates to the certs, the certs really to adjust. It's a matter like on the way up, we lose them until it catches up and the way down, we'll gain. Because we'll have the investments there, and we certainly have the liquidity to cover it. So therefore, it's a positive to us on the cert side when it's going down because of the investments. And just like we've had to catch up situation now when it's been going up.Michael Anthony AnagnostakisGot it. And then I just want to flip on to expenses here. I guess how should we be thinking about long-term G&amp;A growth for the firm given some of the reduction efforts you're undertaking a more fully funded bank and a progress on BMO if you could help us think about the growth between the wealth segment and the firm as a whole, that would be great.James M. CracchioloI would -- let me start and Walter can complement. So overall, for the firm, when we talk about G&amp;A per se, I would say it's relative -- it's going to be relatively flat. Remember, you got merit in creating another things that are part of that, but it will be relatively flat overall based on what we're looking to do. If you think about where there may be a little more versus a little less or maybe a little more in the AWM because of the growth of that business and maybe a bit less on the asset management side, meaning that there will be expense reductions. But overall, if I look at that across the firm, including all the various groups, it will be relatively flat, absorbing the inflationary expenses that occur while we continue to make good investments in the business.OperatorThe next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.Thomas George GallagherFirst question is why did Ameriprise withdraw its application early this month to convert to a state-chartered industrial bank and a national trust bank. Have there been any changes in regulation or rules related to your current structure? Or any -- can you give some perspective on that?Walter S. BermanI think it's a matter of certainly the situation as you look at the FACA Board and what they felt about with the regional bank situation would they really want to now expand into a state. And we just felt the probability was done not there. And we're quite confident with the FSB at this stage. So we withdrew it, rather. And it was just -- again, they were working on decisioning it, and we just felt that we would withdraw based on the clients of circumstances. It will l till -- we still have -- again, the capability, so it doesn't really affect us, but that's the story. With the regional bank and the other situations, the environment just we felt was not there.Thomas George GallagherAnd Walter, do you expect there to be any changes on capital where you might have to hold more? Or is that less certain? Just any perspective on that?Walter S. BermanYes. So from our standpoint, as part of our steady state planning, certainly, the differential. No, if anything, you probably would have a tick up on a state situation, and we certainly understood that. But no, the short answer to the question is no. We do not because of this situation with the state or with the FSB. We quite -- we do not anticipate other than the Fed is evaluating, right, based on the situations that they've seen. And we would be just like anybody else in our -- what the size of our balance sheet impacted for that level.Thomas George GallagherGot you. Next question, just can you comment on any updates on risk transfer on the RPS side? Is that still -- it sounded like you went through a more thorough process, you emerged from it saying you didn't like the pricing, yet you're seeing a lot of competitors in the life insurance space. Do further risk transfer deals so that trend continues. And it's pretty good pricing actually on some of the recent deals. So curious, if that's changed at all your perspective, whether the competitor pricing or where do you stand on overall risk transfer.Walter S. BermanI think that more importantly where we stand with holdings. Certainly, we feel very comfortable with what we have. And as we look at it and then yes, certainly evaluated situations. As we've always said, we've looked at it, many of the stuff in the past has been distressed. Yes, we've seen some changes there. And certainly, we are not going outbound, well certain inbounds come in, we evaluate them. So -- but we are very comfortable where we are right now.Thomas George GallagherBut now would you say nothing's really changed on your view that there's still too wide of a bit spread relative to what you think the value of your book is versus the type of pricing that's out there.Walter S. BermanCertainly, we've seen changes shifting with the books that are going. But again, we don't do a detailed analysis and we actually evaluate facts and circumstance as it relates to us.James M. CracchioloYes. I mean, we haven't gone through an in-depth of what's recently occurred and what may happen in the market. I think from our perspective right now, we have a very solid business there. We have a very low risk profile for that business, as Walter said, it's going to continue to generate roughly $200 million of PTI a quarter, $800 million for a year. Most of that is free cash flow for us. So that's how we think about it. But if there are opportunities that arise, we'll always have to entertain them.OperatorThe next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.Craig William SiegenthalerThanks. Good morning, everyone. So next quarter, you're going to have your annual insurance liability unlocking exercise. And last year resulted in a large negative adjustment with the bear market effect or on the variable annuity book. This year, markets are up a lot, interest rates are up a lot. So my question is, should we get a reversal on unlocking last year just given the bull market that we're in? And also, could there be a release in the long-term care block just given that interest rates are a lot higher?Walter S. BermanYes. The interest rates will tight, but listen, there is a balance between the equity markets and in the interest market. So we -- from that standpoint, our -- looking at our available cap, that's why we came out of a ratio, looking at it because you're looking at it from an LDTI standpoint and from our standpoint, that's why we've determined it is not the driver of it. So the element is statutory from that standpoint. So we feel comfortable that the market is there. The interest rates, certainly, we -- you've seen our position and our excess capital has not changed sequentially. So we right now, it's -- we are navigating the situation, and we feel very confident with it. So as rate -- as environments change, we have the ability to certainly absorb and adjust for it. And yes, if we get benefits, we will evaluate certainly our positioning.Craig William SiegenthalerThanks, Walter. My follow-up, and I think I know your answer here, but I just kind of want to hear it anyway. You stopped some fixed annuities, you insured your book to KKR's Global Atlantic. But we've watched the all to acquire these books pretty aggressively, and now interest rates are back to healthy levels. ROEs on these portfolios are higher and the product isn't that complicated. It's really just credit quality (inaudible). So don't you have a competitive advantage with your large distribution channel in wealth. And you seem pretty happy with their decision. But don't higher interest rates versus the last 15-plus years, changed the calculus on the fixed annuity business, too.Walter S. BermanWell, yes, listen, fixed annuities has certainly gotten back in favor from that standpoint. And we will evaluate it. But it also has implications from a balance sheet standpoint in surrender out of surrender and certainly portfolio. We feel very comfortable with, like you said, with the reinsurance situation and there, but we are constantly evaluating. We'll go back to manufacturing or not. And right now, I think we're comfortable where we are, but certainly, yes, there are advantages to it and it ebbs and flows. We do know that, right? As rates go up and down, you have implications from a liquidity and other standpoint with that portfolio. That's why we basically felt very comfortable reinsuring it.But it's certainly -- we continue -- RPS Group continues to evaluate and make a recommendation on it as we look at it. But we are -- I can say right now, we're good.OperatorThe next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerYou mentioned the 50 -- the 40 to 50 basis points of yield uplift within the bank. Would you expect much, if any, higher deposit costs or interest costs along with that? Or should that predominantly drop to the bottom line?Walter S. BermanThat factor -- that was -- I was giving you actually the asset earning rate on that, going. And -- that was the question. That was what I was referring to.Or as that, we would just add to cost of funds for the bank as we look at the situation where it sources, which is primarily coming out of the sweep accounts.Ryan Joel KruegerOkay. And then you've seen the certificate balance increase this year. I think you're rolling out more products within the bank. At some point, should we expect some of the certificate balances to roll off the group into the bank? And if so, is there much of a margin difference between the 2?Walter S. BermanIf you look at it from that standpoint, the large bound on certificates in the bank should be comparable. And yes, we have built up. And we just -- as Jim indicated, we launched our bank certificate product. So we will certainly have that offering to people. But right now, we're not anticipating big shifts coming in, but we're certainly giving them the capability within a short product.OperatorThe next question is from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.Jeffrey Paul SchmittI have another question on brokerage sweep rates. They appear to be pretty flat from last quarter and the deposit beta seems to have slowed for the industry. And just wondering if there's potential for you to increase your sweep rate if the Fed keeps raising interest rates? Or are competitive levels such that you may not need to raise it much anymore?Walter S. BermanListen, we have a very robust valuation system that goes on to ensure we offer competitive rates in that and we are now evaluating -- the team is now evaluating, yes. So you will have see, as we look at the competitive environment and landscape that we will evaluate then the -- our deposit beta and increase rates accordingly to ensure that we offer our clients competitive rates. That's a very focused program we have.Jeffrey Paul SchmittYes. Okay. And then just on capital return, I think it's running at 80% of operating earnings in the first half. I know in the past, you've sort of targeted 90% or at least for the full year, I mean, should we expect it to move up to that? Or is there any reason it's sort of running below that long-term target?Walter S. BermanWell, right now, we established this year, we said our target for this year is going to be 80%. Obviously, you can go up and down a quarter from that stand. And we're still comfortable with that right now staying with that guidance.OperatorWe have no further questions at this time. And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

So far, overall, this has been rewarding for investors.While the top 14 EV stocks had a market capitalization representing only 13% of that of the Top 10 vehicle manufacturers as of the end of 2019, they still managed to outperform them. That trend continued through last year, both with EV and battery stocks.Electric car sales exceeded 10 million units in 2022, with their market share steadily climbing, from less than 5% of new cars sold in 2020 to 14% in 2022. In the first quarter of this year, we already saw a 25% jump in sales, year-on-year.But this space has become extremely crowded, resulting in a price war that is making investors uneasy.It’s time to find a new niche in the EV segment where first-movers have a very clear advantage: electric boating, where innovators hope to take the EV revolution off-road. The waterways are going electric, too.That’s why the next big thing in racing is all-electric, with NFL superstar Tom Brady joining the UIM E1 World Championship with ownership of an electric boat racing team. The inaugural season of the EV boating world championship is set to launch in early 2024.The electric boat playing field is far less chaotic and crowded, and the first-mover advantage goes to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), which offers a proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor that is being used in the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.The newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries expected to start this summer.The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E- Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.Story continuesThe company is expecting first revenues from PowerTrain this year and is aggressively pursuing an electric disruption to the boat rental market, with franchise plans well underway. While it’s been all about build-out and launch over the past couple of years, VMAR is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive next year, and it’s not burning cash like its road warrior brethren.The Sound of Silence OpportunityThe global electric boat market was valued at $5 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $16.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2022 to 2031.Narrowing that down by type, the 40-foot electric boat market alone is worth $1.9 billion as of 2023, and is set to hit $4.93 billion by 2030 for a growth rate of 14.6% during that time period.As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself. Not only is the marine battery market forecast to grow by 18.6% to 2030, but it represents a $2-billion opportunity for investors over the next five years.And while climate change is a key element propping up the electric boating industry, it’s not the only ‘attraction’:Electric boats are quiet. They completely change the boating aesthetic by removing the sound of the loud outdoor motor, which overwhelms all other sound at sea.They’re safe, too.  There’s no risk of gasoline leaks or carbon monoxide poisoning common with internal combustion engines.The consensus seems to be that electric boat motors, by design, are more robust than their loud and dirty predecessors, and they also require a lot less frequent maintenance than a gasoline engine. They’re cheaper to operate over the long-run: No oil changes, no filters or tune-ups, and while combustion engines require maintenance every 100 hours, electric motors (on average) can go up to 3,000 hoursThe World’s Most Powerful Electric PowerTrainVision Marine’s E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP outboard motor on the market.The 180E Electric Powertrain can provide a consistent 180 HP of pure electric power, with cutting-edge high voltage power when you need it most, and a completely scalable powerbank.The proprietary technology is end-to-end: It includes the batteries, the engine and the software, making it the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class.The E-Motion outboard motor can fully charge overnight with no additional infrastructure and boasts the highest horsepower engine in its class. And from a cost perspective, it out-competes everyone else, which should help it to capture new market share.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR),  E-Motion motor isn’t confined to speedboats, either; they’re turning pontoon boats into faster, better and cleaner versions of themselves.VMAR is in the process of equipping a pontoon with electric propulsion and solar panels for the longest known electric boat run in America (and possibly in the world). VMAR’s Zenith pontoon will set off in Virginia on a 1,050-nautical-mile journey to Miami, Florida, to showcase the capabilities of sustainable electric power.How they plan to market the E-Motion Powertrain is the part that should sound more attractive to investors who may or may not have been taken for a wild ride with EV investments. VMAR isn’t trying to manufacturer its own boats, which would mean burning through cash at an untenable rate (just like all the smaller EV companies right now). Instead, it’s marketing E-Motion to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), and they’ve already received an impressive volume of orders.Last September, right out of the gate, VMAR received and initial purchase order from the North America’s Limestone Boat Company for $2 million worth (25 units) of E-Motion 180E outboard motors and Powertrain systems. Limestone is now moving into scheduled production, with delivery target to dealers set to begin in 2024.But the bigger picture is this: VMAR’s proprietary electric motor and powertrain system turns any boat into an electric boat, which makes its strategy to sell motors (not boats) to OEMs an incredibly savvy one in a market flooded with EV makers who are spending more money than they might ever make.A Second, Disruptive Revenue ChainVMAR also plans to plug in the boat rental market.The global boat rental market (across all boat types) was valued at $18.2 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $31.2 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2022 to 2031. It’s a huge market that is about to go electric.And, again, VMAR has first-mover advantage.VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model.By 2024, it’s expected to be full speed ahead with scaling.The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.By the end of 2024, Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR),  expects to be free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.Other companies to keep an eye on:Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) is a prominent player in the chip manufacturing and research sector. As the leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company supplies advanced machinery to semiconductor production factories. Despite being overshadowed by other tech stocks, Applied Materials' significance in the industry cannot be ignored.

Reports suggest the company may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter, showcasing its commitment to innovation. Moreover, Meta's strong focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations and boost monetization positions it well for upcoming technological shifts. With a solid financial position, maintaining an average operating margin of 36.2% over the past five years and generating substantial free cash flow, Meta has the resources to drive further growth. These factors make Meta an appealing option for investors seeking a strong and forward-looking player in the social media and AI landscape.IBM (NYSE: IBM), a tech giant with a history of resilience, has demonstrated consistent sales growth despite challenging market conditions.
