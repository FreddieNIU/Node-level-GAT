Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: BlackRock, Inc BLK, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW, HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE, Block, Inc. SQ and CME Group Inc. CME.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:3 Crypto Stocks to a Keep Tab on in AugustThe cryptocurrency market has seen rampant growth since it began with Bitcoin (BTC) in 2009. Investments in cryptocurrency picked up largely in 2021, but the majority of the gains were exhausted in 2022. The Federal Reserve’s constant hiking of interest rates, along with the FTX fallout, weighed heavily on the cryptocurrency market.However, 2023 began on a positive note for most of the cryptocurrencies. Even though these cryptocurrencies are trading at a narrow range for quite some time, their current prices are way below their all-time highs in the 2021 bull run, indicating significant upside potential.Most importantly, cooling inflation and a relaxed macroeconomic scenario are expected to boost digital currencies. In June, retail inflation increased 3% year over year, but that’s way below the 9% peak it had hit last year.Thus, with the prices of indispensable goods and services showing signs of cooling, the Fed is widely expected to be less aggressive with its monetary policy stance (read more: 5 Solid Stocks to Gain on Signs of Inflation Cooling Down).Around 82.5% of market participants now expect the central bank not to hike interest rates in September, as it was done in June, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Needless to say, interest rate hikes always adversely impacted high-risk assets, including digital coins.Additionally, renewed interest among financial behemoths in crypto is expected to drive the prices of digital coins higher in August. While BlackRock, Inc has requested regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, The Charles Schwab Corporation, in particular, has supported a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets.Story continuesHence, it seems that the cryptocurrency market is poised to pull out of its doldrums, and it's judicious for risk-tolerant investors to cash on this bullish trend by keeping an eye on solid crypto stocks. These stocks comprise cryptocurrency miners, and companies specializing in blockchain technology. Prominent among them are HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd., Block, Inc. and CME Group Inc.Bitcoin mining company, HIVE Blockchain reported encouraging financial results in June. Moreover, HIVE Blockchain’s profit margins are expected to improve since the price of Bitcoin hasn’t fallen below $20,000, which, as a thumb rule, results in negative margins.HIVE Blockchain’s shares have soared 236.8% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 18.8% in the same period.HIVE Blockchain’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 77.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE’s current-year earnings has moved up almost 54% over the past 60 days. HIVE Blockchain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Block, by the way, is one of the biggest investors in Bitcoin. The company currently has about $235 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, per CoinGecko. Block is, at present, benefitting from its strong Cash App engagement, and the users of Cash App can easily purchase and sell Bitcoin.The company has made exponential investments in blockchain technology, and its CEO has converted the name of the company from Square to Block. Shares of Block have gained 17.1% in the year-to-date period.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block’s next-year earnings has moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. Block has a Zacks Rank #1.In terms of trading volume, CME Group is the largest futures exchange in the world. It is one of the pioneers to offer trading in Bitcoin futures, which were earlier being traded as unregulated securities. Shares of CME Group have gained 20.6% in the year-to-date period.The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CME Group’s current-year earnings has moved up 3.4% over the past 60 days. CME Group has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Now, since HIVE Blockchain, Block, and CME Group are primarily related to Bitcoin, they are further positioned to gain next year due to Bitcoin’s halving event. Halving lowers Bitcoin's supply, which in turn boosts its price. Last time, in the year 2020, the price of Bitcoin on the halving day was $8821.42, while the price 150 days later increased to $10,943, per cointelegraph.com (read more: 4 Crypto Stocks That Have Outshined Bitcoin This Year).Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Broyhill Asset Management highlighted stocks like The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Westlake, Texas, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a savings and loan holding company. On August 4, 2023, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock closed at $64.92 per share. One-month return of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was 14.32%, and its shares lost 6.33% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $118.157 billion.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""After the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the market turned a critical eye to the financial sector. Institutional investors sharpened their forensic accounting pencils and hypothesized, ""What would happen to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should its depositors take their money and run?"" While this is a helpful exercise, we believe the probability of a run on Schwab Bank is low. Schwab is not SVB. Its deposit base is sticky and fragmented; Silicon Valley's was not. Less than 10% of SVB's deposit base was under the FDIC insurance limit, and its core customers were rate-sensitive startups and venture capitalists with fickle cash needs. In contrast, ~80% of Schwab's deposit base is under the FDIC's limit and spread across millions of brokerage accounts that keep cash on hand for investment. Rather than spending our time replicating doomsday scenarios, we began by estimating the risk to Schwab's earnings power should it need to raise the rate paid on deposits in line with competitors. Even under this scenario, we believe our downside is limited. Longer term, we believe Schwab has multiple levers it can pull to monetize the ~ $7 trillion in assets trusted in its custody.""Story continuesCharles Schwab, bank, financePhoto by Brendan Church on UnsplashThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

2,41abd31a-7563-3ede-aad5-bae6857d1c11,STT,2023-08-07,State Street (NYSE:STT) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.69,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-nyse-stt-increasing-101150598.html,1691403110,STORY,['STT'],"[State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 12th of October to $0.69. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 3.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, State Street has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Based on State Street's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 34%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 9.1%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 36% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.96 total annually to $2.76. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. State Street has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.0% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like State Street's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for State Street that investors should take into consideration. Is State Street not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

3,d1d70b7a-957d-3a4b-bea1-b760e3b73578,QRVO,2023-08-07,Here's What's Concerning About Qorvo's (NASDAQ:QRVO) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-qorvos-nasdaq-124014082.html,1691325614,STORY,['QRVO'],"[When researching a stock for investment, what can tell us that the company is in decline? A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This reveals that the company isn't compounding shareholder wealth because returns are falling and its net asset base is shrinking. Having said that, after a brief look, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Qorvo:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.022 = US$136m ÷ (US$6.7b - US$639m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Qorvo has an ROCE of 2.2%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Qorvo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Qorvo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Qorvo.What Does the ROCE Trend For Qorvo Tell Us?We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Qorvo. About five years ago, returns on capital were 2.9%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. This combination can be indicative of a mature business that still has areas to deploy capital, but the returns received aren't as high due potentially to new competition or smaller margins. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Qorvo becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOur Take On Qorvo's ROCEIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. Despite the concerning underlying trends, the stock has actually gained 28% over the last five years, so it might be that the investors are expecting the trends to reverse. Either way, we aren't huge fans of the current trends and so with that we think you might find better investments elsewhere.While Qorvo doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation  on our platform.While Qorvo may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:13% = US$5.7b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's significant 20% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TMO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.8%, meaning that it has the remaining 94% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Thermo Fisher Scientific has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 5.5%. Regardless, the future ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is predicted to rise to 21% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the EV market, head directly to 5 Best EV, Battery and Autonomous Driving ETFs. The International Energy Agency expects a significant increase in electric vehicle sales compared to 2022, with an estimated 35% year-over-year growth, amounting to 14 million units sold by the end of 2023. This uptick is expected to be driven by new purchases, especially in the second half of the year. Electric cars are expected to make up 18% of total vehicle sales for the whole year, given the national policies and incentives supporting the electric vehicle industry. Rising oil prices may further motivate buyers to switch to electric cars. While EV sales are typically low in non-major markets, countries like India, Thailand, and Indonesia experienced remarkable growth in 2022, with sales more than tripling compared to the previous year, reaching 80,000 units. In India, there is a significant increase in EV and component manufacturing, thanks to the government's $3.2 billion incentive program that has attracted a total of $8.3 billion in investments. Similarly, Thailand and Indonesia are also making efforts to support EV adoption through policy schemes and investment incentives, potentially setting an example for other emerging market economies.Don't Miss: 12 Best Biotech ETFs To BuyGlobal EV manufacturers are leaning towards advanced technology to compete amongst themselves and local industry leaders in the highly competitive Chinese market. China is the world's largest electric vehicle market, with 5.9 million vehicles sold in 2022. This represents 59% of global EV sales, as reported by Canalys, a technology research firm. Domestic brands dominate the EV market in China, capturing an 81% share, with key players being BYD, Wuling, Chery, Changan, and GAC. BofA Securities predicts that China will maintain its position as the largest EV market globally in 2025, with an estimated 40%-45% market share. Canalys commented in a recent report: Story continues“China’s domestic brands are leading the market in the development and implementation of advanced assisted driving systems, capitalizing on their early-entry advantages in the electric and intelligent vehicle sector. These brands have an edge over other joint ventures in the planning and execution of smart assisted driving systems.”Similarly, according to BofA analysts: “China auto makers are accelerating vehicle platform, technology upgrade or innovation, leading to outstanding user experience.

KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS)5-Year Performance as of August 4: 48.92%KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS) tracks the performance of the Bloomberg Electric Vehicles Index, which includes companies involved in electric vehicle production, autonomous driving, shared mobility, lithium and copper production, battery manufacturing, hydrogen fuel cells, and electric infrastructure businesses. The ETF was founded on January 18, 2018, and holds more than $190 million in net assets as of August 3, 2023, along with an expense ratio of 0.72%. KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS) is one of the EV etfs to invest in. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the largest holding of KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS). On July 19, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 and a revenue of $24.93 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.09 and $200 million, respectively. For the second quarter of 2023, Tesla announced new record vehicle deliveries of 466,140, exceeding market expectations. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 82 hedge funds were bullish on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 91 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 6.2 million shares worth $1.3 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund had this to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the first quarter of 2023:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells EVs, related software and components, and solar and energy storage products. Following a sharp decline at the end of 2022, Tesla’s stock rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 on investor expectations that Tesla will continue to grow vehicle deliveries and maintain solid gross and operating margins despite a potential recession, competition in China, and vehicle price reductions. We wrote a long piece on Tesla last quarter and refer readers back to it, because for long-term investors not much has changed over the last three months. Tesla did hold its first Investor Day in March, and several Baron analysts and portfolio managers attended. We toured the Austin Gigafactory, drove in a Cybertruck, boarded a Semi truck, and spoke with a wide swath of Tesla senior managers. During the formal presentation, Tesla highlighted, among other things: (1) its broad and deep bench of executive talent supporting CEO Elon Musk; (2) its “Master Plan 3–Sustainable Energy for All of Earth,” which featured EVs, renewable power from solar and wind, and stationary electric storage; (3) its vehicle assembly innovations, including massive casted parts (building Model Y bodies with single front and rear castings, replacing a substantial number of parts and fastening steps), a stainless steel exoskeleton (for Cybertruck), and its next-generation highly efficient “unboxed process” for its next-gen $25,000 vehicle; (4) a future permanent[1]magnet electric motor that will not require any rare earths; and (5) the massive untapped market opportunity for commercial stationary electric storage, branded Megapack, as the world steadily shifts to renewable energy. As long-term shareholders, we have witnessed Tesla exploit its innovative Model 3/Y now-global mass-market platform to increase vehicle deliveries from barely a standing start to over 1.3 million units, while achieving industry-leading margins and reinforcing its iron-clad balance sheet to almost $23 billion in cash (and effectively no recourse debt). We expect Tesla’s next-generation EV and Megapack products to have a similar impact on company results.”9.

While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”8. iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSE:IDRV)5-Year Performance as of August 4: 65.90%iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSE:IDRV) aims to replicate the performance of the NYSE FactSet Global Autonomous Driving and Electric Vehicle Index.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), a U.S.-based EV manufacturer, fell during the quarter. Despite seven-fold growth in its monthly production rate between late 2021 and the end of 2022, production guidance for 2023 missed analyst forecasts because of supply-chain constraints, principally semiconductors. Moreover, notwithstanding an attractive long-term opportunity and favorable product reviews by customers and industry experts, investors remain concerned about liquidity risks as the company burns cash during its early production stage while unit economics remain challenged. Vehicle sales through the end of 2023 will be at Rivian’s legacy vehicle pricing, which was set before inflationary and supply-chain pressures emerged last year across the entire automotive space. New pricing and improved unit economics should be realized in 2024, and Rivian is slated to launch its R2 vehicle line in 2026. We have adjusted Rivian to a smaller position in our portfolio. Despite near-term macro and execution risks, we do believe that Rivian’s current valuation offers attractive long-term returns. During the year, we will remain focused on Rivian’s production ramp, vehicle demand, unit-level economics, and cost controls as well as progress on its R2 vehicle platform, its next-gen Enduro electric motor, and its battery system advancements.”6.

""Through the monthly noise, inflation appears set on a downward path. However, progress in the coming months is likely to be slower and noisier than June's print alone would suggest.""Wells Fargo expects to see that headline prices rose 3.3% and ""core"" inflation jumped 4.7% over last year.This report will serve as the latest piece of what will be a robust set of data presented to the Fed before their next policy decision on September 20.The July jobs report on Friday showed the US economy added 187,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Wages were firmer than forecast, rising 4.4% over last year, but some economists expect that in light of increased worker productivity, the Fed is unlikely to see this as an additional inflation impulse.Story continuesBob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said on Friday the jobs report had ""something for everyone.""""Simply put, the latest jobs report is as close to a Goldilocks outcome as could be hoped,"" Schwartz added. ""For one, it pushes recession fears further onto the back burner. ... For another, the jobs report provides encouraging news for inflation doves, who believe the Fed should take its finger off the rate-hiking trigger.""Outside of inflation data this week, the economic calendar will feature the NFIB's small business optimism report, the University of Michigan's check on consumer sentiment, and data on producer prices.On the corporate side, Disney results will be the week's biggest earnings update, with investors asking tough questions about the streaming and TV business as subscriber growth slows while Hollywood strikes pressure production and bring the entertainment world into the AI fray.Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the ""Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny"" red carpet event at Palais des Festivals on May 18, 2023, in Cannes, France. (Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images) (Vittorio Zunino Celotto via Getty Images)As earnings season has rolled along, AI updates from across the corporate world have been abundant.Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban noted Friday that with earnings for the biggest tech companies behind us, not all leaders took the same tactic toward hyping AI advances.Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon were the most forceful in touting their AI prospects, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple struck a more measured tone.Apple CEO Tim Cook downplayed AI plans, telling analysts on Thursday, ""We tend to announce things as they come to market, and that's our M.O. and I'd like to stick to that."" Meanwhile, Amazon executives said ""generative AI"" no fewer than 20 times on their earnings call Thursday evening.Apple stock fell 5% on Friday after a third straight quarter of revenue declines and a larger-than-expected drop in iPhone sales hit shares. Amazon gained more than 8% after results in its Amazon Web Services business showed revenue growth slowed less than expected.Results from UPS (UPS), Palantir (PLTR), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Lyft (LYFT) will also feature this week as earnings season winds down.Source: Yahoo FinanceData from FactSet published Friday showed that through last week, 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported results with blended earnings for the index — which includes companies reporting and forecasts for those still to come — pointing to a 5.2% drop in earnings per share from last year. This will mark the third straight quarter of earnings declines.And while 79% of companies that have released earnings are beating forecasts, which is more than the 10-year average of 73%, investors have judged results harshly this quarter.FactSet's data showed companies reporting results better than forecasts during this earnings season are seeing their stock drop 0.5% during the period covering the two days before and after the report. Over the last five years, the average change for a company's stock over this period has been a 1% gain on positive numbers.With the market having rallied so aggressively this year — and that rally broadening in June and July across all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 — second quarter earnings season has become a ""sell the news"" event.Weekly calendarMondayEarnings: Palantir (PLTR), Beyond Meat (BYND), Chegg (CHGG), Lucid Group (LCID), Paramount Global (PARA), RingCentral (RING), KKR (KKR), Tyson Foods (TSN), Skyworks (SWKS)Economic data: Consumer credit, June (+$14 billion, $7.24 billion previously)TuesdayEarnings: UPS (UPS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Twilio (TWLO), Bumble (BMBL), Rivian (RIVN), Capri Holdings (CPRI), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Lyft (LYFT), Restaurant Brands (QSR), Novavax (NVAX), Under Armour (UAA), Warner Music Group (WMG), Li Auto (LI), Fox Corp (FOXA), Celsius (CELH), Blink Charging (BLNK), Duolingo (DUO), Dutch Bros (BROS)Economic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, July (90.5 expected, 91.0 previously); Trade balance, June (-$65 billion expected, -$69 billion previously); Wholesale trade sales, June (-0.2% previously); Wholesale trade inventories, June (-0.3% previously)WednesdayEarnings: Disney (DIS), Roblox (RBLX), Warby Parker (WRBY), The Trade Desk (TTD), Jack In The Box (JACK), GoodRx (GDRX), PENN Entertainment (PENN), Stratasys (SSYS), Valvoline (VVV), Reynolds (REYN) Illumina (ILMN)Economic data: MBA Weekly Mortgage Applications (-3% previously)ThursdayEarnings: Alibaba (BABA), Ralph Lauren (RL), YETI Holdings (YETI), Wolverine World Wide (WWW), Utz Brands (UTZ), Krispy Kreme (DNUT), Six Flags (SIX), Hanesbrands (HBI), Dillard's (DDS), Flowers Foods (FLO), News Corp.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Microchip Technology’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology What Is Microchip Technology Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 16.91% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microchip Technology today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $71.39, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Microchip Technology’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Microchip Technology?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microchip Technology's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MCHP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MCHP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Now it has adapted its software techniques to hunt the so-called white hydrogen stored in the Earth’s crust.Scientists posited more than 20 years ago that rocks deep under the earth’s surface might be harbouring the gas, but that getting to it could involve drilling down several kilometres.However, a deposit found in France this year could yield high-purity hydrogen at a depth of only 3,000 metres.The US Geological Survey said in April that there is probably enough accessible hydrogen to meet total global demand for “hundreds of years”.Getech says its software can identify “sweet spots” for the gas using models of the earth’s subsurface and artificial intelligence.Chairman Richard Bennett said: “Natural hydrogen is anticipated to be a major future energy resource and we expect the exploration industry will be keen to utilise our expertise, especially given our reputation for successfully locating other types of energy sources and our ability to provide data simply and compatibility.”Hydrogen is seen as an important alternative to burning methane for industrial processes, since it can burn at high temperatures, combining with oxygen and with water as the only byproduct.It is also a candidate for replacing petrol in cars and trucks, heating homes and powering aeroplanes. But today “green hydrogen” is made either by splitting water molecules using renewable electricity, which is expensive, and “blue hydrogen” by splitting methane molecules and storing the carbon dioxide, which is carbon-intensive.The US Energy Department is drawing up plans to help kick start the white hydrogen industry, deeming the potential “astronomical”.Story continuesViacheslav Zgonnik, a Ukrainian geologist, has estimated that the gas price could fall to $1 a kilo compared to the $3-$4 it costs today, making it far more economical as a replacement for oil and gas.Another prospector, Gold Hydrogen, has found accumulations with 80pc hydrogen at 500 metres in the Yorke Peninsula of South Australia.As well as burning well, hydrogen is attractive because it can be stored, while storing electric power is tougher and less efficient than using it immediately.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

His departure is the latest high-profile exit from the Wall Street giant in recent months.Julian Salisbury, chief investment officer of its asset and wealth management arm, is departing to join investment firm Sixth Street, according to an announcement last month.Currie, 56, coined the phrase ""Revenge of the Old Economy"" in 2004 to describe how commodity prices would spike after decades of underinvestment, according to the memo. His forecast was borne out in what would become known as the commodities supercycle, during which crude oil surged to record highs in 2008.More recently, Currie revived his prediction for another supercycle fuelled by pandemic stimulus measures and rebounding economic activity.""We expect a structural bull market in commodities, very similar to what we saw in the 2000s or the 1970s,"" Currie told the Reuters Commodities Summit in late 2021.The firm ""has greatly benefited from Jeff's thought leadership on a broad range of topics and his ability to identify fundamental commodity market themes well before others,"" Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist and head of global investment research, wrote in the memo.Currie joined Goldman in 1996 and was promoted to managing director in 2002, then partner in 2008.

Here are three fashion stocks worth buying for the Barbie boost.Ralph Lauren (RL)A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.Source: Martin Good / Shutterstock.comBarbie and Ken are preppy fashion icons, and there is no company more associated with the preppy look than Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL). The company that popularized the polo shirt has been on a tear lately, with its stock up 35% over the last 12 months — including an 18% gain in 2023. With consumer spending holding strong, especially among affluent Americans, it has benefitted Ralph Lauren. At the end of May, the company posted an impressive first-quarter earnings beat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe fashion retailer announced Q1 earnings per share of 90 cents, which beat consensus forecasts of 65 cents. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1.54 billion, which was better than the $1.52 billion that had been expected on Wall Street. Ralph Lauren also boasts a strong balance sheet, with $1.5 billion of cash and only $1.1 billion of long-term debt at the end of March. Trading at 16 times forward earnings, RL stock looks reasonably valued. And, the stock pays a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 2.34%.Story continuesLululemon Athletica (LULU)A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comBoth Ken and Barbie like to stay fit and hang out at the beach. And what better wardrobe for those activities than Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)? The athletic apparel retailer that caused a sensation with its yoga pants and other workout gear has seen its stock perform strongly over many years. LULU shares have increased 16% this year, 27% in the last 12 months, and 213% over five years. The company continues to ride the enduring popularity of its athletic wear to new heights.The company’s latest fashion sensation is its bestselling “Everywhere Belt Bag.” Essentially a fanny pack worn like a purse, the belt bag has gone viral and become a social media sensation. The company’s ability to successfully market different products and make many of the items it sells viral sensations has contributed to its success. At the start of June, LULU stock jumped 15% on a Q1 earnings beat. The company announced that its revenue rose 24% in Q1 to $2 billion, sending Wall Street analysts scrambling to revise their forecasts on the stock. As far as fashion stocks go, this is one investors definitely don’t want to overlook.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comBarbie is known for her hair and make-up as much as her clothes, and what better cosmetic stock to own than Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA). The retail chain of beauty stores has more than 1,200 locations that collectively sell $10 billion worth of cosmetics and fragrances each year. With more than 35,000 employees, Ulta Beauty has been growing at a quick rate, pushing its share price up in the process. ULTA stock has increased 14% in the last 12 months and is up 80% over the past five years.However, ULTA stock has dipped recently and is 18% below its 52-week high, presenting a decent entry point for investors. Despite the share price drop, Ulta Beauty continues to attract consumers, reporting customer traffic rose 11% in its most recent quarter. The company also enjoys a high profit margin of 17% versus just 6% among other retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT). And, unlike competing cosmetic companies such as Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), Ulta Beauty does not have a lot of exposure to China, where consumer sales are waning.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

(NYSE:GS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 28th of September to $2.75. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.1%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, Goldman Sachs Group was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 63.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $11.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 19% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that Goldman Sachs Group has been growing its earnings per share at 13% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.We Really Like Goldman Sachs Group's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

28,a90410fe-ac55-3aee-b475-9d955dc5796f,SLB,2023-08-07,Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Schlumberger and Oceaneering International,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-090000067.html,1691398800,STORY,"['OII', '^GSPC', 'SLB']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 7, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Schlumberger SLB and Oceaneering International OII.Crude Oil Pops, Energy Sector Rebounds: Stocks to WatchIt’s been a wild couple of years for oil prices.The days of negative prices for crude oil futures seem lightyears away. The pandemic-induced oversupply of oil led to an unprecedented collapse, forcing the contract futures price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to plunge near -$37/barrel.As economies around the world reopened from lockdowns, oil prices rebounded as travel slowly picked back up. WTI finished that year just under $50/barrel.Fast forward to 2022, a 40-year high in inflation saw WTI crude hit over $130/barrel. The journey from negative to a nearly 14-year high (in a span of less than two years) was unparalleled, and speaks to the remarkable stage of events that took place. It also highlights the unpredictable and dynamic nature of the financial (in this case, commodity) markets.Recent Uptick in Crude Oil PricesOil prices peaked for the cycle in March of last year, and since then have been in a steady downtrend, shedding more than 50% of their value from peak to trough. But a recent surge above $80/barrel has WTI crude on the verge of a breakout.WTI crude prices leapt 16% in July. Why are prices rising? For one, Saudi Arabia instituted a 1 million barrel-per-day cut, and voluntary production cuts by OPEC+ members were made back in April. But perhaps more importantly, U.S. stocks of crude oil fell by 17.05 million barrels for the week ended July 28th. It marked the largest single-week decrease dating back to 1982, when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) first began reporting the data.Stocks to WatchCoinciding with the recent pop in oil prices is a resurgence in the energy sector, which lagged throughout the majority of this year. The Zacks Oils and Energy sector posted a gain of more than 6% during the month of July. Still, major oil companies have been reporting large declines in second-quarter profits. Lower fossil fuel prices relative to the same period in the prior year are putting a dent into bottom lines. Energy stocks have largely shrugged off the results, as companies have been accentuating larger dividends and stock repurchases.Story continuesOn the other hand, a select number of companies have been able to buck the downward earnings trend. In late July, Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, delivered second-quarter earnings results of $0.72/share, a 44% increase versus the same quarter last year. Revenues of $8.01 billion improved 19.6% during the quarter.SLB pays a $1.00 (1.74%) dividend. A Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Schlumberger has exceeded earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 5.54% over that timeframe. SLB shares have bounced more than 30% off the June low and are approaching 52-week highs.Another company that has navigated the current landscape is Oceaneering International, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Oceaneering International is a leading supplier of offshore equipment and technology solutions to the energy industry. The company provides engineered services and products, as well as robotic solutions to offshore energy, defense, manufacturing, and entertainment industries.Just last week, the energy company reported Q2 earnings of $0.18/share, a 157.1% increase versus the same quarter last year. Revenues jumped 14.1% to $597.9 million.OII stock has more than doubled in price over the past year. Shares broke out last month to a new 52-week high before recently experiencing a minor pullback.Oceaneering International has been on the receiving end of positive earnings estimate revisions lately, which our research has shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices. For fiscal 2023, estimates have been raised by 9.89% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $1.00/share, reflecting potential growth of 222.58% relative to last year.Make sure to keep an eye on crude oil as prices near a potential breakout, as well as a renewed energy sector.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Then, as a complacent investor on the beach, you miss the signs that say ""Danger: Sharks."" Or rather, ""Danger: Correction.""And make no mistake, there are a lot of complacent investors.""Expectations are on the more optimistic side. So any small thing could rattle investors,"" JPMorgan Private Bank senior markets economist Stephanie Roth told me on Yahoo Finance Live. ""There [is] a long list of things that are potentially surprising to markets. Everybody is generally complacent. So it could be any negative news that would scare investors.""The market is already pouring some cold water on complacent investors, but I wonder if it needs to happen more broadly if stocks want to mount a rally into 2024.Apple's stock got hit by 3% on Friday simply because of a minor sales miss in iPhones. IPad sales weren't great, sure. And yes, September guidance was meh, at best.But this wasn't a disaster quarter for Apple! In fact, the company's most profitable line of business — services — saw sales grow 8% from the prior year. In the prior quarter, services sales rose 5.5%.The company is sitting on billions upon billions in cash, and they are using it to aggressively buy back stock. The Vision Pro release later this year is a clear tailwind for Apple's valuation multiples.Yet the stock gets hit. Why? Investors were probably expecting too much from Apple's numbers given the stock is up about 50% on the year.Again, investors got complacent.Story continuesWe saw the same outcome over at Netflix following its earnings. Great quarter. Great outlook. The stock gets hammered the next day.Why? Complacency and over-exuberance.The raw data from earnings season underscores this new market dilemma.The average stock price has declined 0.7% after earnings among the S&amp;P 500 companies that have announced, according to Evercore ISI pro strategist Julian Emanuel. Companies beating on both the top and bottom lines are only higher by 0.5% on average vs. a 1.0% average gain over the past five years.Companies missing on the top and bottom lines are seeing their stock price knocked down by 2.6% on average.""We see a market more vulnerable to bad news as stocks have become extended on a short-term basis,"" opines the always astute strategist Keith Lerner at Truist. ""We already have seen some of this vulnerability in the first few days of August on Fitch’s surprise downgrade of US debt. Also, the move in the 10-year US Treasury yield above the 4% level will likely act as a headwind to further expansion in already lofty equity valuations.""Keith is spot on.

The pharmaceutical sector is lucrative in general around the globe, while the space is very profitable in America in particular. The latter point is true because drug prices are often astronomical in the U.S. For example, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review recently determined that two treatments for sickle cell disease could be worth as much as $2.05 million annually per patient. Given how huge the payout for a drug can be, investors can make a profit by buying biotech stock bargains. Companies whose ability to successfully market their drugs in the U.S. is being greatly underestimated by the Street. Here are three biotech stock bargains that are well-positioned to generate gargantuan profits for those who buy them.Novavax (NVAX)Novavax (NVAX) research laboratory logotype enlarged with a magnifying glass.This laboratory has developed a vaccine against the covid-19 virus.

I don’t think that the country would have made such a generous offer if it viewed the company’s shots as altogether useless or unimportant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd with some studies showing elevated rates of myocarditis among the recipients of the RNA shots and some experts raising concerns about the general impact of the vaccines on the immune system, Canada’s continued interest in Novavax’s alternative shot make sense. Moreover, I expect many other countries to follow in Canada’s footsteps, making NVAX one of the biotech stock bargains.ImmunityBio (IBRX)Scientist using a microscopeSource: Maksim Shmeljov / Shutterstock.comImmunityBio (NASDAQ:IBRX) stock has sunk over 50% so far in 2023.The company discovered a protein that’s apparently a great treatment for a type of bladder cancer. Indeed, in a Phase 2 and 3 trial over 90% of those with that form cancer were able to avoid having their bladder removed.Story continuesHowever, the Food and Drug Administration has refused to approve the treatment. They claimed they found problems with the facilities of IBRX’s partners that were supposed to manufacture the protein. And indicating that the agency still has some doubts about the treatment’s efficacy, it did ask that IBRX provide addition data  about the protein. Specifically, the agency wants more information about how long the treatment’s impact lasts.Still, given the strength of the data on the protein’s efficacy, if IBRX can get its manufacturing partners to clean up their acts or find new partners, the treatment looks poised to become a blockbuster. And it shouldn’t be that hard for ImmunityBio to accomplish one of those feats.Bionano Genomics (BNGO)Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the backgroundSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comBionano Genomics (NASDAQ:BNGO) stock has retreated nearly 60% so far this year. And yet signs continue to mount that the company’s optical genome mapping (OGM) technique of evaluating DNA is going to become very widely used as a diagnostic tool.YouTube host Mr. Invest Alot recently reported that University Health Network (UHN), a group of hospitals in Canada, is extensively using Bionano’s OGM to diagnose blood cancers. More specifically, the hospitals are utilizing about 1,500 of Bionano’s flowcells annually. And in a few years, they intend to  analyze 2,000-2,500 genomes annually at a cost of $400 each.Also very positively for BNGO stock, Adam Smith the director of UHN’s Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, reported that there are at least ten of Bionano’s OGM analysis tools being used in diagnostic labs in Canada at this point. And, he believes that most cryogenetic labs in Canada will switch to utilizing OGM in the next two years. Smith’s statements indicate that Bionano’s tech is increasingly being used to diagnose cancer.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held LONG positions in BNGO and NVAX.

Tyson closed two other chicken plants, in Arkansas and Virginia, with almost 1,700 employees this year, and has also laid off corporate employees.The decision by Tyson, the largest U.S. meat producer by sales, to shutter facilities surprised and saddened local officials, who said the four plants have been fixtures for more than 50 years.Tyson said it will move the work done at the closing plants - located in North Little Rock, Arkansas; Corydon, Indiana; Dexter, Missouri; and Noel, Missouri - to newer facilities closer to its customers.

Pilgrim's Pride, one of the world's largest chicken producers, also saw sales decline from last year in the latest quarter.Tyson has already cut corporate jobs and shuttered other chicken plants this year as it grapples with declining profits and reduced demand from consumers squeezed by inflation and higher interest rates.The company has also struggled to predict sales and previously said reduced demand for beef made it difficult to pass on higher costs for labor and feed to consumers.""Chicken, beef and pork all face different types of macro and market challenges,"" Chief Financial Officer John R.

In January, Tyson replaced the president of its poultry business.Story continues""If you look at the chicken business today versus where we were just a quarter ago, there are more tailwinds than headwinds in the chicken business in the near to long term,"" King said Monday.A reintroduction of certain antibiotics to Tyson's chicken supply chain could help the company forecast supply and demand by producing more uniform birds with consistent weights, King said.In the beef business, Tyson faces reduced profit margins as a diminishing U.S. cattle herd raises costs for livestock.Net losses attributable to Tyson were $417 million, or $1.18 per share, compared with a net income of $750 million, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, Tyson earned 15 cents per share, falling short of analysts' expectations for a profit of 26 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.""Domestic consumers continue to look for lower-cost protein alternatives, trading down from higher-cost proteins like pork or reducing overall protein consumption,"" Rabobank said.(Reporting by Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru and Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Milla Nissi, Louise Heavens and Anna Driver)]"

The following is a summary of the updated outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for revenues, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and tax rate for fiscal 2023. Certain of the outlook numbers include adjusted operating margin (a non-GAAP metric) for each segment. The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2023 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2023 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of and the amount of any potential applicable future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.Beginning in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. We targeted an aggregate $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We realized more than $700 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions, and we surpassed our aggregate $1 billion target in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, more than a year ahead of our plan.BeefUSDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 3% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of (1)% to 1% in fiscal 2023 as margins are expected to decrease.PorkUSDA projects domestic production will be relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate adjusted operating margin of (4)% to (2)% in fiscal 2023.ChickenUSDA projects chicken production will increase approximately 3% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of (1)% to 1% for fiscal 2023.Additionally, we announced the closure of four Chicken segment processing facilities, located in Corydon, Indiana; Dexter, Missouri; Noel, Missouri; and North Little Rock, Arkansas, to further optimize network asset utilization. We expect to shift production to other facilities and cease operations at the impacted locations in our first two quarters of fiscal 2024. We continue to evaluate the financial statement impact of the closures for charges related to contract terminations, impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance and retention. Based on our preliminary analysis, we currently estimate total charges of $300 million to $400 million which will be recorded through the planned closure dates.Prepared FoodsWe anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 8% to 10% in fiscal 2023 driven by volume growth, productivity and disciplined revenue management.International/OtherWe anticipate improved results from our foreign operations in fiscal 2023 on an adjusted basis.RevenueWe expect sales to be $53 billion to $54 billion in fiscal 2023.Capital ExpendituresWe expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures include spending for capacity expansion and utilization, automation to alleviate labor challenges and brand and product innovation.Net Interest ExpenseWe expect net interest expense to approximate $340 million for fiscal 2023.LiquidityWe expect total liquidity, which was approximately $3.7 billion as of July 1, 2023, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion.Tax RateWe currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 22% for fiscal 2023.

Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA). Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.TYSON FOODS, INC.Adjusted EPS Non-GAAP Reconciliation(In millions, except per share data)(Unaudited) Third Quarter Nine Months Ended Pretax Impact EPS Impact Pretax Impact EPS Impact  2023   2022   2023   2022   2023   2022   2023   2022                 Reported net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (GAAP EPS)    $(1.18) $2.07      $(0.56) $7.42                 Less: Production facilities fire insurance proceeds, net of costs5$(44) $(67)  (0.10)  (0.13) $(79) $(107)  (0.17)  (0.22)                Add: Restructuring and related charges$50  $—   0.11   —  $93  $—   0.20   —                 Add: Plant closures$15  $—   0.04   —  $107  $—   0.22   —                 Add: Legal contingency accrual$38  $—   0.08   —  $38  $—   0.08   —                 Add: Goodwill impairment 7$424  $—   1.20   —  $424  $—   1.20   —                 Less: Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at lower enacted state tax rates$—  $—   —   —  $—  $—   —   (0.10)                Adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (Adjusted EPS)    $0.15  $1.94      $0.97  $7.10 Adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to Tyson (Adjusted EPS) is presented as a supplementary measure of our financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.

That base is 5,000 miles from its leafy Cambridge birthplace that is still labelled the group’s global headquarters.And yet Arm might have expected to have become more American before now, considering the US accounts for about half of all microchip revenues in an industry where sovereignty is paramount and the US and China vie for supremacy.In fact, the company could have been acquired by arch rival Intel in its early years, long before a plan was hatched by SoftBank to fold it into the artificial intelligence leader Nvidia. That move was blocked by competition authorities in early 2022, sending Arm down today’s IPO path.Softbank boss Masayoshi Son chose to list Arm in the US rather than the UK in a blow to Rishi Sunak's tech ambitions - REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonGiven the UK’s patchy record at growing its technology companies into world beaters, the fact its microprocessor designs are licensed 1000 times a second for use in smartphones, laptops, industrial sensors and cars – generating a handful of cents in royalties each time – is something to cheer.Arm would be cheered louder at home if only SoftBank supremo Masayoshi Son had succumbed to Rishi Sunak’s overtures and agreed to relist Arm shares here.Story continuesEven though it is currently supporting 2,800 well-paid jobs in Cambridge, does the choice of Wall Street over the City of London represent a turning point for what remains the UK’s flagship technology firm?The company benefited from US influence from day one. If Apple hadn’t been looking for a new processor for a portable device it developed many years before the iPhone, the Arm project would have been gradually wound down within struggling Acorn. For a modest $2.5m, Apple entered a joint venture with its one-time competitor in home computers and Arm was spun out to serve them both and see if it could build a wider customer base.Even that nascent technology was American by design. Eager to leapfrog the pack, Acorn’s top engineers, Roger – later Sophie – Wilson and Steve Furber, were enchanted by a 1981 project that had emerged from the University of California, Berkeley to produce a high-performance central processing unit on a single chip.The rationale for the reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) design was that 80 per cent of the time a chip used just 20 per cent of its instructions, so the rest could be stripped out to reduce cost and power consumption and tasks could be broken down into a handful of simple instructions.Other RISC projects were fixed on producing high-end business workstations but Wilson and Furber favoured the mass market. Their Acorn RISC Machine – later Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) – delivered 25 times the performance of the top-selling BBC Micro computer.The design featured in the Acorn Archimedes in 1987 and, six years later, Apple’s MessagePad, which also became known as the Newton. After some fallow years, liftoff happened in 1997 when the first Nokia mobile phone to feature Arm’s designs, the 6110 that also included the addictive Snake game, was unveiled.A picture of the handset ensured the prospectus for Arm’s first IPO in 1998 sizzled, especially with fund managers in the US, a market that at the time lagged Europe for its nifty cellphones.Arm’s instruction set architecture (ISA) – a digital rulebook that determines how the microprocessor in any device is controlled by software – broadened its application and the company broadened out too. The company charged into the US in August 2004, paying $913m for Artisan Components, its first significant acquisition, which was poorly received by investors who sent the shares down 18 per cent on the day.Arm's chip designs have been used over 200 billion times - Chris Ratcliffe/BloombergIn retrospect, some Arm executives regarded the Artisan deal as the right idea at the wrong price – and perhaps it was even the wrong target too. What few realised – and the company did not acknowledge publicly – was that Arm viewed the deal as an insurance policy in its long-term face-off with Intel, the US microchip giant irked at the British upstart’s colonisation of the mobile space.The deal certainly achieved a shift in Arm’s locus towards the US West Coast, where many of its customers were also based.The leadership followed. High-flying executive Simon Segars relocated with his family from Cambridge in 2007 to fix an initially troubled integration, making him an instant favourite to succeed Warren East as Arm’s boss when the vacancy arose in 2013. Some insiders expected Segars to return to the UK at that point but he opted to remain in the US.These days the company is led by a veteran American, Rene Haas, a Los Angeles Lakers basketball fan who often dresses head-to-toe in black like his Silicon Valley counterparts.On his watch, the culture has toughened. Internally, Arm has culled blue-sky research projects to focus on more commercially viable activities. Externally, it has explored different pricing models with a view to fattening margins.Arm has its low-priced royalties to thank for its ubiquity. Its designs have been used an astonishing 250 billion times. But this has led to frustration that the company has missed out on the growth and rocketing valuations enjoyed by its semiconductor peers.What’s risky is attempting to shift the calculation of its fee from a slice of the chip’s value to a portion of the value of the end-device such as an in-car component or tablet computer.What is easier to benefit from is supplying its designs to more expensive chips, such as those powering computer servers that store reams of data remotely. The Graviton chips custom-made by the cloud computing market leader, Amazon Web Services (AWS), contain Arm blueprints.After 15 years of trying, the company’s breakthrough in this field is sure to be emphasised as a key growth opportunity when it comes to courting new investors this autumn.Arm has focused on more commercially viable ventures under the leadership of American Rene Haas - David Paul Morris/BloombergSo too will be the buzz around AI, whose applications are portrayed as a step-change for computing but from Arm’s point of view still demand the upwards-only improvements in performance and power efficiency to which it has grown accustomed. And before AI generates meaningful revenues, the company can point to a 5.7 per cent increase in sales last year – creditable after a dip in the smartphone market from which it is eager to demonstrate it can diversify from.The biggest indicator of corporate change emerged last summer, when Arm sued Qualcomm, one of its largest customers and a key developer of 5G technology, alleging the breach of licence agreements and trademark infringement.Arm demanded the destruction of some designs it said were transferred without its consent from Nuvia, a start-up Qualcomm acquired a year earlier that had been set up by a group of former Apple chip designers.It was a classic semiconductor industry spat, with parallels of the row between the mobile giants Apple and Samsung that rumbled on for years. Yet it was rare for Arm to be drawn into something where the stakes were so high.Qualcomm’s use of Arm designs has been expected to increase its market share in personal computers and cars. The American company believed it had licences covering the Nuvia technologies and said the lawsuit, scheduled for September 2024, marked “an unfortunate departure” from the pair’s longstanding relationship.This aggressive tone is mirrored by moves that may test Arm’s long-held industry independence. Success in recruiting Nvidia and others as anchor investors ahead of the IPO would certainly juice the company valuation but how to appease those among its 1,000 partners that didn’t get the invitation to buy early?On the eve of that share sale, is Arm still the quirky British interloper with a unique business model or just another cutthroat American tech stock dreaming of Tesla-like multiples? Currently both descriptions resonate. But British or American, its future success relies on adopting the only culture that Wall Street gets – growth at all costs.James Ashton’s book, The Everything Blueprint, the story of Arm and its place in the global semiconductor ecosystem, is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for QUALCOMM:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.25 = US$10b ÷ (US$49b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 25%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceIn the above chart we have measured QUALCOMM's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering QUALCOMM here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?QUALCOMM's ROCE growth is quite impressive. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 122% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Our Take On QUALCOMM's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that QUALCOMM has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And a remarkable 114% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.QUALCOMM is not the only stock earning high returns.

However, it is the only developed country that doesn’t have universal health coverage. Most Americans receive their coverage from a combination of public programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.Moreover, data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that the country's average life expectancy has dropped to 76.4 years, the lowest level in almost two decades. Per the findings, the decrease in life expectancy was primarily caused by deaths from COVID-19 and drug overdoses, particularly those caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl.In addition to a short life expectancy at birth, the U.S. struggles with a high prevalence of chronic illnesses, avoidable deaths, and obesity. Obesity, a medical condition in which a person has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more, is a growing concern in the country, with a prevalence of 41.9% in 2017-2020.Numerous variables, including excessive eating, inactivity, heredity factors, metabolism, culture, and poor dietary choices contribute to obesity, which can have a negative impact on health. Osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer are just a few of the major health effects of carrying extra fat.According to the CDC data, obesity rates in 41 U.S. states were more than 30% in 2021. At 25%, Hawaii had the lowest obesity rate, followed by Colorado and Massachusetts, each with 25.1% and 27.4% respectively.Most and Least Healthy States in the U.S.The 2022 America's Health Rankings (AHR) Annual Report by the United Health Foundation identified New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Utah, Maryland, Washington, and Colorado as the top healthiest states in the country, while Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Alabama were ranked as the least healthy.Story continuesFor example, aside from having good healthcare system, Hawaii is known for its health-conscious residents, who engage in leisure-time physical activity, have healthy eating habits, and a low proportion of obesity. In a similar vein, residents of Colorado take pleasure in outdoor pursuits like hiking and generally pay attention to their health by consuming nutrient-dense foods. Besides, a high majority of Coloradans—about 93.5%—have health insurance, which is important because it enables people to access the medical and preventive care they need to attain and maintain good health.On the contrary, in West Virginia a sizable proportion of adults don't exercise outside of their regular jobs, and it has the highest prevalence of adult obesity out of all 50 states, at 40.6%. Additionally, the state has one of the highest rates of heart disease-related deaths in the country (223 per 100,000 population).Analysis of the health and wellness market and the upsurge of health consciousness in the United StatesWe reported previously that a survey conducted by Nutrisystem and OnePoll found that more than 70% of Americans were now more health-conscious post the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering how their weight had an impact on their immunity, more than 60% of the respondents were motivated to shed pounds.Furthermore, a survey by McKinsey last year revealed rising US consumer interest in wellness across six domains: health, fitness, nutrition, appearance, sleep, and mindfulness. 50% of consumers reported wellness as a key priority in their daily lives (up significantly from 2020).Meanwhile, a report by Allied Market Research estimates that the global health and wellness market was valued at $4.7 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9% from 2022 through 2031, reaching a value of $12.9 trillion at the end of the forecasted period. The increasing prevalence of physical and mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression, are the main drivers of this growth. In 2021, North America dominated the global health and wellness market. Per the report, the region is anticipated to experience the fastest growth in the industry during the projected period.The key market players in the global health and wellness market include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Nestle and Loreal among others.Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. On July 20, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) posted earnings for the second quarter of 2023, reporting a Non-GAAP EPS of $2.80, beating market estimates by $0.18. The revenue over the period was $25.53 billion, up 6.4% compared to the revenue over the same period last year.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the largest consumer staples companies in the world. This June, VOOST, a vitamin brand owned by the company, announced the U.S. launch of VOOST Gummies, which deliver on four of the most popular benefits in the vitamins, minerals and supplements category, including Men’s and Women’s Multivitamins, Immunity and B12. The Gummies, fruit-flavored without a sugar coating, meet the changing health and wellness requirements of consumers. However, ironically, the company is also behind many cigarette brands.Having said that, lets take a look at the most health-conscious states in the U.S.25 Most Health-Conscious States in the U.S.Copyright: halfpoint / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyTo compile the list of the most health-conscious states in the U.S., we initially consulted our first key metric, the United Health Foundation's 2022 America's Health Rankings (AHR) Annual Report to see the overall health of all 50 states in the country.We then proceeded to assign a score to each state based on its ranking in the report, creating a list A. For instance, the #1 healthiest state in this report will get a score of 50/50=1, #2 healthiest state will get a score of 49/50=0.98 and so on.We then looked up for our second key metric, obesity rates in all 50 states in 2021, with data courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States. The states were arranged in ascending order on the basis of their obesity rates, and the same scoring methodology was used to create a list B.Please note that, due to insufficient data, the CDC was unable to provide the obesity rate for Florida. But Florida's Department of Health indicates a 28% obesity rate, so we used this figure.The overall score for each state was calculated by adding up their individual scores in the aforementioned lists. Finally, we sorted the states by their overall scores and identified the 25 most health-conscious states in the U.S. When two states had the same overall scores, we used each state’s obesity rate as a tie-breaker.Don't Miss: 25 Most Health-Conscious Countries in the WorldMost Health-Conscious States in the U.S.25.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.4b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Intuitive Surgical's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 9.0% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Intuitive Surgical's decent 8.1% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 9.7% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Intuitive Surgical's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

CNI, CSX Corp. CSX and USD Partners LP USDP.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2132753/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-amid-the-industry-weaknessProspects of Zacks Transportation - Rail industry’s participants are being dented due to challenges like inflation-induced high-interest rates, weak freight rates and supply-chain disruptions.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Canadian National Railway Co., CSX Corp. and USD Partners LP appear better placed to tide over the challenges. Declining fuel costs represent a tailwind as far as bottom-line growth is concerned.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Deciding the Industry's OutlookDecline in Oil Price is a Tailwind: The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil prices declined 6.6% in the April-June period. As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, the fall in oil prices bodes well for the bottom-line growth of railroad stocks.Dividend Hikes Signal Financial Bliss: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies, are reactivating shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. For example, in 2023, CSX raised its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty Continues:  Although favorable symptoms of easing inflation have brought some relief to U.S. stock markets, the recent rate hike remains a concern. The Fed reinitiated its interest rate hike process in the July FOMC meeting after taking a breather in June. On Jul 26, 2023, the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5.25%-5.50%. This marked the highest range of the Fed fund rate since March 2001.Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1.6% on a month-on-month basis in June 2023. In fact, the index has declined month on month in four out of the first six months of the year. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #222. This rank places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The sell-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been decreasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has decreased 11.3%.Despite the cloudy prospects, we present a few stocks that investors can retain given their sturdy potential. But before that let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and its current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 1.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite’s gain of 8.6% and the broader sector’s surge of 4.8%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.25X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 6.05X. It is also above the sector’s P/B ratio of 4.62X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereCanadian National: Based in Montreal, Canada, Canadian National is involved in rail and related transportation business. CNI’s efforts to reward its shareholders via dividends and buybacks are encouraging and highlight the company's financial strength. In January, the company announced an 8% dividend hike.

58,19126cc6-7a30-3d4e-b9c3-4e36b3bebff1,CSX,2023-08-07,CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $0.11,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-nasdaq-csx-affirmed-dividend-120541551.html,1691323541,STORY,['CSX'],"[CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) will pay a dividend of $0.11 on the 15th of September. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 1.4%, which is around the industry average. See our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, prior to this announcement, CSX's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 19% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.187, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.44. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.0% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though CSX's EPS has declined at around 2.4% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.In SummaryOverall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that CSX has the ability to continue this into the future. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Before making this announcement, Amphenol was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 11.8%.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.105 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 23% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received.

A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.We Really Like Amphenol's DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, ICICI Bank Ltd. IBN, MercadoLibre, Inc. MELI, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Verizon, ICICI Bank and MercadoLibreThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Verizon Communications Inc., ICICI Bank Ltd. and MercadoLibre, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Verizon have declined -11.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Wireless National industry’s decline of -13.0%. The company’s continued retail prepaid and postpaid net losses are hindering its top-line growth. Stiff competition from other major players and saturation in the U.S. wireless market is hurting profits.Heavy spending on promotional activities to attract customers is also weighing on margins. It has reiterated its soft guidance for 2023 due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, Verizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum.It is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that has led to solid customer additions. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products are tailwinds. Healthy traction in wireless business augurs well.(You can read the full research report on Verizon here &gt;&gt;&gt;)ADRs of India's ICICI Bank have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry over the past six months (+14.1% vs. +5.4%) reflecting the favorable growth outlook for the country. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Jun 30) results show higher revenues, robust loans and deposit balance and a rise in provisions. Increased dependence on domestic loans, a rise in retail loan demand, higher interest rates and a stable funding base are expected to support the company's financials.Furthermore, efforts of digitizing banking operations will help generate non-interest income, thereby supporting revenue growth. However, weak asset quality remains a major near-term headwind. Macroeconomic concerns, including high inflation across the globe, make us apprehensive.Moreover, elevated operating expenses, mainly on the back of technology investments and ongoing branch expansion initiatives, will likely impede the bottom-line growth.(You can read the full research report on ICICI Bank here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Argentina-based MercadoLibre have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. -3.5%). The company’s revenues were driven by accelerating commerce and fintech revenues. Increasing total payments volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, aided the company.MercadoLibre’s rising gross merchandise volume (GMV) remained another positive. Strong shipment growth also contributed well to the reported results. MercadoLibre is benefiting from strength in its commerce and fintech businesses.

63,472d35e0-d413-3e5b-aa56-3759dabb31b1,TPR,2023-08-07,Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Is Achieving High Returns On Its Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestry-nyse-tpr-achieving-high-110454400.html,1691406294,STORY,['TPR'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tapestry, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$7.0b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Tapestry has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Luxury industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for Tapestry roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Tapestry compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Tapestry's ROCE Trending?Tapestry is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 20% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo sum it up, Tapestry is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 1.6% to shareholders. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Tapestry  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Alas, NVDA shares launched the next day toward $475!If you want access to the deeper dives from March on ChatGPT or the June ""$2 Trillion"" path, just email Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you.Where Goes NVDA Now Before Earnings?So if I told clients and investors to definitely buy NVDA at $425 before earnings -- now less than 2 weeks away -- how do I feel now?Well, with the pullback to $450, my signals are full green-lit for the coming beat-and-raise to push shares toward all-time highs of $500.And since Wall Street analyst estimates just pushed next year's topline revenue another $2 billion higher to $57B in the past few weeks -- representing 33.7% growth -- I think they are still catching up to this story, just like when I said they were behind in December and March.Meanwhile, EPS projections for next year just moved 5.7% higher in the past few weeks from $10.19 to $10.77, representing 38.3% growth.Even expert spreadsheet jockeys who focus on this company for a living don't yet fully understand the scale of NVIDIA AI architectures that will create tremendous demand and add trillions in economic value for every sector and industry. They finally, yet timidly, have stuck their necks out this year with $500 price targets.If you read and watch the content deep dives I've linked above, you will understand what they are missing.And then you will see why you want to buy NVDA, and its satellites like Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), in the next 2 weeks. Additionally, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) just confirmed their #2 position behind NVDA in GPU  ""massively parallel architectures"" for AI deployment. Story continuesIf you can't stomach NVDA at 18-20X sales, buy AMD at 7-8X.

These companies are industry vanguards with a history of solid earnings, robust management, and consistent dividends, serving as safe havens in stormy markets.They promise the potential for a solid rebound as the market climate marches towards the positive. So let’s take a look at these discounted blue-chip stocks.T-Mobile (TMUS)Source: ShutterstockAmerica’s third-largest wireless carrier, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), continues to command attention. Having fortified its position through its seismic $26.5 billion merger with Sprint three years ago, T-Mobile has undergone a resurgence.The architect behind the firm’s growth trajectory, former CEO John Legere, managed to turn around the business and navigates a successful merger in his seven-and-a-half-year tenure. T stock is up double-digit margins in the past three years, but this year has been a start-stop story.Despite missing revenue expectations this quarter, T-Mobile flipped the script to post a whopping profit of $2.2 billion. It recorded an 11% rise in core adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, reaching $7.3 billion.In operations, T-Mobile proudly showcased industry-best net additions, with postpaid net account additions and customer additions on the higher side of estimates.Story continuesIndeed, the company’s resilience and performance offer an encouraging narrative for investors ahead and makes it one of the discounted blue-chip stocks to buy now.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comNavigating through a challenging patent cliff, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) continues to prove its mettle. Despite the blow of key drugs losing exclusivity, the firm is standing firm with its powerful strategic plans.Though Bristol-Myers Squibb has faced setbacks with its key drugs, such as Revlimid and Abraxane, losing exclusivity, the company’s forward-thinking initiatives are worth noting.Recently introduced medicines such as Camzyos, Sotyktu, and Opdualag have shown rapid demand growth. As we advance, the company forecasts these three drugs to generate peak sales north of $12 billion, painting a promising long-term picture.Bristol Myers has masterfully positioned itself for a powerful long-term rebound in the face of declining sales for some of its erstwhile stalwarts. It’s a testament to Bristol-Myers Squibb’s resilience and adaptability amidst shifting market landscapes.NextEra Energy Inc (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) continues winning investors with its heartening performances, cementing its place as a renewable energy vanguard.With a strategic focus on wind and solar energy, its clean energy investments have driven consistent growth.

The company’s exceptional growth and plans to double capacity by shifting towards cleaner energy sources by 2026 sustain optimism over the company’s future.Despite its premium valuation, NextEra Energy presents a promising prospect for long-term investors with its high returns and renewable commitment.Verizon Communications Inc (VZ)Verizon (VZ) logo above the entrance to a Verizon store.Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comResilience and stability define Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) as one of America’s premier telecom giants.Despite the fluctuating market dynamics, the firm continues offering various services, from mobile and internet to other related offerings. Amid an industry faced with many trials and tribulations, Verizon has successfully navigated the waters, emerging stronger and poised for rapid expansion ahead.Daunting challenges such as sizeable 5G investment and the increasing rivalry from cable companies have disrupted the telecom sector’s smooth journey.Couple this with the rising interest rates on its massive debt load, and one can comprehend the reasons for the market’s lukewarm response to VZ stock.Verizon’s recent financials paint a picture of endurance. Its second-quarter figures surpassed market estimates with aplomb with adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share and a robust $32.6 billion operating sales.It posted an impressive $8 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year alone. Verizon embodies a promising investment opportunity, with its shares trading less than seven times forward earnings and boasting a compelling 7.7% dividend yield.Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands out as a titan in the hydrocarbon sphere, having caught the attention of dividend investors for a good reason.Despite the shifting narrative towards renewable energy sources, the high energy density, and the intermittency of wind and solar power, oil and gas players such as Chevron bring valuable diversification to the sphere.With a forward yield of more than 3.8% and a comfortable payout ratio of 36%, the firm offers an attractive dividend portfolio with 37 consecutive years of dividend increases.Though it witnessed a dip in its second-quarter net income and sales compared to last year, the figures have comfortably blown past analyst expectations, proving its long-term worth.The rise of electric vehicles has somewhat muted Chevron’s glamour recently, but a broader perspective reveals its enduring long-term relevance.Backed by robust revenue growth and consistent profitability, Chevron is a pertinent player in long-term investment.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV)Red umbrella covering stacks of billsSource: ShutterstockUndeterred by the industry’s headwinds, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV), bearing its distinctive red umbrella emblem, offers a spectrum of insurance solutions that continue to resonate with its massive customer base.From property &amp; casualty to auto, home, and business insurance, Travelers has made its mark across multiple segments.While the firm encountered rough weather in the second quarter, with its core income experiencing a steep 98% year-on-year decline due to escalating catastrophe losses, there’s a silver lining.Revenue for the quarter surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by record net written premiums amounting to $10.3 billion.Moreover, the firm has more than $600 million in its cash till, which should help it stave off any financial crises that may come its way following its so-so second quarter.Consequently, Travelers remains a sturdy vessel in the tumultuous seas of the insurance sector. Fueled by robust revenue growth and dividend growth over 17 years, TRV stock remains an enticing pick.Pfizer Inc. (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPositioned as a linchpin in the pharmaceutical realm, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) remains a stalwart, promising tremendous growth and long-term value.Coupled with its tempting dividend yield of more than 4.5%, the company represents an alluring prospect for investors craving a steady income stream.Pfizer’s journey, of course, is not without its share of hurdles. Post-pandemic growth concerns loom, and financials face the brunt of tough year-over-year comparisons, given the company’s pivotal role during the health crisis.Yet, Pfizer is battling these headwinds with an aggressive push into research and development. Its positive efforts have effectively resulted in a promising pipeline projected to unlock more than $20 billion in additional sales from new molecular entities by 2030.Topping off this optimistic outlook, new business developments could chip in another $25 billion in revenue during the same period.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Meanwhile, ""Barbie"" surpasses $1 billion in global ticket sales.1. Futures higher as inflation data loomsU.S. stock futures pointed higher Monday as investors looked ahead to the release of key monthly inflation figures later in the week and prepared for more corporate earnings.By 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract gained 74 points or 0.21%, S&amp;P 500 futures added 15 points or 0.33%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 69 points or 0.45%.The main indices on Wall Street fell to end the previous trading week, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipping to their fourth-consecutive day of declines -- the longest losing streak since May. Data showing weaker-than-anticipated jobs growth in July, as well as disappointing hardware sales from tech behemoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), both factored into market sentiment.Highlighting the economic agenda this week is the U.S. consumer price index for July, which could give traders further insight into the potential policy path ahead for the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is set to publish its third-quarter results on Wednesday (see below).2. Headline inflation seen acceleratingEconomists predict that inflation in the U.S. grew at a faster pace for the first time since June 2022 last month, possibly complicating the emerging narrative of easing price growth in the world's largest economy.The consumer price index (CPI) for July is expected to accelerate to 3.3% annually, up from 3.0% in the prior month. Month-on-month, the reading is seen holding steady at 0.2%.Thursday's CPI print will also include the so-called ""core"" figure stripping out volatile items like food and energy. The reading is projected to slow to 4.7% year-on-year and stay unchanged at 0.2% on a monthly basis.Story continuesFederal Reserve officials, who previously said that their upcoming policy decisions would be ""data-dependent,"" will likely be paying close attention to the numbers.Corralling inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target has been the major focus of the central bank's more than year-long campaign of interest rate hikes, and data since last summer suggest that the tightening has helped to tamp down prices. Yet, policymakers have signaled that they remain willing to roll out further rate increases should inflation show signs that it is climbing once again.3. Earnings season marches onInvestment management giant KKR (NYSE:KKR), software group Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), and entertainment firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARAA) will make up some of the biggest companies unveiling their latest quarterly results on Monday.The returns will kick off the final stretch of the second-quarter earnings season. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, more than 84% of the businesses in the S&amp;P 500 have already reported, with about four-fifths of these numbers topping Wall Street expectations.Walt Disney may likely be one of the major headliners later in the week.Investors will be keen to hear more about chief executive Bob Iger's plans to reignite performance at the media conglomerate's movie studios after a series of recent box office disappointments like ""Elemental"" and ""Haunted Mansion."" Iger may also face questions around ESPN after reports surfaced that he brought on two former lieutenants to help explore strategic options for Disney's vaunted sports network.4. 'Barbie' soars above $1BIt's a ""Barbie"" world, indeed.""Barbie"" has raked in more than $1B in ticket sales worldwide just 17 days after its debut, according to a unit of distributor Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD).In a statement, the studio said Greta Gerwig's pink-splashed fantasy comedy took home $459.4 million in North America and $572.1M overseas. The figures were later confirmed by media analytics group Comscore.It also makes Gerwig the first-ever woman to solo-direct a billion-dollar picture.Warner Bros. executives Jeff Goldstein and Andrew Cripps said they were ""rendered speechless"" by the success of the film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the titular doll and her frustrated counterpart Ken. Goldstein and Cripps noted that the returns have ""blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water.""""Barbie,"" which was aided by a massive marketing campaign and an Internet phenomenon that paired it with Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer,"" is now the sixth movie to surpass the billion-dollar box office mark since the pandemic.5. Crude hovers around four-month highOil prices edged lower Monday but remained near their highest levels since mid-April after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announced plans late last week to extend output reductions for another month to tighten global markets further.Along with the production cuts from Riyadh and Moscow, traders will be eyeing Chinese economic data this week to gauge how much government stimulus may be needed to boost a waning post-pandemic recovery in the world's biggest crude importer.By 05:06 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.66% lower at $82.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.57% to $85.75.Both contracts recorded their sixth consecutive weekly gains last week, the longest winning streak since December 2021 to January 2022.Related ArticlesU.S. CPI and earnings ahead, 'Barbie' tops $1 bn - what's moving marketsAnalysis - Will AI be an economic blessing or curse?

""With today’s numbers, the risk has increased that the flash estimate of stagnating GDP growth in the second quarter could still be revised downwards.""European stocks also struggled last week as a downgrade in the U.S. sovereign rating, rising Treasury yields, and weak Chinese economic data dented the appetite for risk-driven markets.Key inflation data in spotlightThat said, losses are limited as investors focus on a series of inflation figures during the week, amid growing expectations that the Fed and the European Central Bank are near the end of their tightening cycle.German CPI data is due for release on Tuesday, as well as numbers from China, while data from the United States are scheduled for Thursday.Siemens Energy stock rises despite hefty wind turbine hitIn Europe, the earnings season is slowing down, although Siemens Energy (ETR:ENR1n) is in the spotlight after the German energy group said problems at its wind turbine unit would cost it €2.2 billion (€1 = $1.0989), resulting in an expected annual net loss of around €4.5 billion.Still, the stock rose 3.9%, rebounding after an early hit, after the company posted strong growth in orders and revenue, and logged a record order backlog in its third-quarter earnings report.Story continuesPostNL (AS:PTNL) stock soared over 7% after the Dutch postal firm lifted its 2023 operating profit guidance.Across the pond, the focus will be on the entertainment sector with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), and Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) all expected to report tough conditions.

CHD, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG and Colgate-Palmolive CL.Industry: Cleaning SuppliesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2132632/4-soaps-cleaning-materials-stocks-to-gain-as-industry-catches-onPlayers in the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry have been benefiting from solid demand for consumer products and brands, strong operational execution and expansion into new markets. Robust pricing initiatives have been vital in boosting sales for industry participants. The companies remain focused on digital commerce growth, product innovation and brand building strategies.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending have been denting profitability. Companies like Unilever PLC, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Colgate-Palmolive have resorted to cost-curtailment actions to counter cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies manufacturing and supplying fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items.Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the ones mentioned above. A few players also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores, pet stores and websites.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryFavorable Demand &amp; Pricing Actions: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing revived demand trends across markets. The industry participants have been benefiting from solid demand for products and brands, stemming from continued brand relevance. Gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives are also driving organic sales for several industry players.The companies have been adopting bold pricing initiatives across markets to combat rising costs due to the persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes. The cost-based pricing actions have been boosting the margin and profitability of several industry players.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: The companies frequently invest in product development to cater to the consumers’ changing needs. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving companies' sales in the soaps and cleaning products space. Players have been undertaking pricing, packaging, marketing initiatives and restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures.Companies also remain focused on expanding into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, has been another key sales driver for the industry participants.This has led the companies to constantly step up their efforts in the e-commerce arena through improved delivery and payment systems.

China’s oil imports have remained close to record highs this year.Production cut extensions boost sentimentThat said, the underlying tone has been boosted by last week’s decisions by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their production cuts into September, raising hopes that tightening supplies will offset a potential slowdown in demand this year.Saudi Arabia will keep trimming production by 1 million barrels per day and Russia will cut oil exports by 300,000 barrels a day, the countries confirmed on Thursday ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies the following day.Saudi Arabia “further assured the market that the cuts could be prolonged further or even deepened if required to balance the market,” analysts at ING said, in a note.Story continuesMore Chinese stimulus eyedExpectations of more stimulus measures in major oil importer China have also aided sentiment, although economic data continued to paint a bleak picture for the Asian giant.“Higher crude oil prices, ample domestic inventory and a slower economy could weigh on Chinese demand over the coming months. However, stimulus or supportive measures from Beijing could help improve the demand outlook for the rest of the year,” ING added.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)Related ArticlesOil retreats from 4-month highs ahead of key inflation dataGoldman Sachs' Jeff Currie, who predicted commodities supercycle, to retireBrazil 'natural' coffee hits premium market in challenge for small farmers]"

Offering over 100 services, the new region is a complete and highly secure hyperscale cloud platform that allows customers to build and run applications. It is physically isolated from Oracle's other public and government cloud regions and shares no backbone connections with them, including the existing Sydney and Melbourne public regions that are available to all Oracle Cloud customers. The completed IRAP assessment at PROTECTED level provides assurance to Australian public sector organizations that Oracle Cloud for the Australian Government and Defense adheres to appropriate security controls. ""The ACT Government welcomes Oracle's investment in this new capability here in Canberra,"" said Andrew Barr, chief minister and treasurer, ACT Government. ""The cloud region will be an important addition to our city's digital infrastructure and adds to the depth and breadth of the capabilities that our cyber security sector can offer.""""The Australian federal government has budgeted more than US$1.3 billion for digital and ICT in its 2023-24 budget, and we're committed to helping strengthen Australia's digital economy. Australia's private and public sectors have trusted Oracle to help accelerate innovation for more than two decades,"" said Stephen Bovis, regional managing director, Australia and New Zealand, Oracle. ""The addition of the new government cloud reinforces our commitment to delivering a secure, scalable, and high-performing cloud platform and business applications that are built to meet the stringent security standards necessary to protect Australia's most important data. With the new region, public sector organizations can now bring their most important workloads and applications to the cloud, helping drive organizational growth while delivering improved services to Australian citizens.""Story continuesGovernment cloud customers will have access to over 100 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and applications, including Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL HeatWave Database Service, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle Cloud VMware Solution, as well as integrated security capabilities such as zero-trust architecture and Oracle Cloud Guard. Oracle provides this consistent set of cloud services across all 45 cloud regions, giving public sector organizations a government cloud with the same capabilities and pricing as Oracle's commercial cloud regions. These applications and services will help the public sector harness data to uncover new value and optimize workloads, typically without requiring costly re-architecture. In addition, since 2020, Oracle has maintained a whole-of-government (WofG) agreement with the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) to make it easier for Australian government agencies to purchase Oracle products and services.Supporting the Public Sector with Security and Data SovereigntyOracle has decades of experience securing data and applications and with its security-first approach, customers have access to capabilities across a broad array of services that make highly secure implementations easy, cost effective, and fully integrated. Oracle Cloud for Australian Government and Defense enables customers to deploy applications that adhere to Australian data sovereignty and residency regulations for locally hosted sensitive data.*""Digital sovereignty has been a growing issue, with governments increased needs for control over their data, infrastructure, resources, and software. Increasingly, governments are engaging and partnering with trusted cloud partners to stay abreast of their challenges in this journey,"" said Daphne Chung, research director of cloud services and software, IDC Asia/Pacific. ""Despite economic uncertainties, IDC forecasts Australia public cloud services to grow at a five-year CAGR of 19.2 percent to become a US$19.2 billion market in 2026.""For additional protection, Oracle Cloud for Australian Government and Defense is restricted to public sector organizations and their partners. Oracle is currently the only hyperscale cloud provider to operate physically separate cloud regions for governments outside the U.S., with eight government regions across the U.S., U.K., and Australia, in addition to multiple air-gapped isolated regions for the U.S. government.""Building on our experience with sovereign government regions in the U.S. and the U.K., Oracle is providing the Australian government with cloud infrastructure that has the same services and consistent global pricing as our public cloud regions. Why should governments have to pay more and get less?"" said Rand Waldron, vice president, global government sector, Oracle. ""This region, restricted to the government community, will make it easier for Australia to bring its most important systems to the cloud and take advantage of the unique efficiency, support, and capability that Oracle offers to drive their mission success.""Customers and Partners Embrace Oracle CloudOCI supports private and public sector organizations globally by offering a wide range of distributed cloud deployment options beyond public cloud regions, including Dedicated Region and Exadata Cloud@Customer, which can assist with applications where data proximity and low-latency in specific locations are of critical importance.Read the full announcement here. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/oracle-strengthens-australias-digital-economy-with-a-new-government-cloud-301894225.htmlSOURCE Oracle]"

But at least one ax-wielding giant seemed too weird for some fans, leading them to take to social media to question if it was human-made.Hasbro-owned D&amp;D Beyond, which makes online tools and other companion content for the franchise, said it didn't know until Saturday that an illustrator it has worked with for nearly a decade used AI to create commissioned artwork for an upcoming book. The franchise, run by the Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, said in a statement that it has talked to that artist and is clarifying its rules.“He will not use AI for Wizards' work moving forward,” said a post from D&amp;D Beyond’s account on X, formerly Twitter. “We are revising our process and updating our artist guidelines to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&amp;D.""Today's AI-generated art often shows telltale glitches, such as distorted limbs, which is what caught the eye of skeptical D&amp;D fans.Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast didn’t respond to requests for further comment Sunday. Hasbro bought D&amp;D Beyond for $146.3 million last year. The Rhode Island-based toy giant has owned Wizards of the Coast for more than two decades.The art in question is in a soon-to-be-released hardcover book of monster descriptions and lore called “Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants.” The digital and physical version of the package is selling for $59.95 on the D&amp;D website and due for an Aug. 15 release.The use of AI tools to assist in creative work has raised copyright and labor concerns in a number of industries, helping to fuel the Hollywood strike, causing the music industry's Recording Academy to revise its Grammy Awards protocols and leading some visual artists to sue AI companies for ingesting their work without their consent to build image-generators that anyone can use.Hasbro rival Mattel used AI-generated images to help come up with ideas for new Hot Wheels toy cars, though it hasn't said if that was more than an experiment.]"

(NYSE:UPS) For Its Upcoming Dividend?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-united-parcel-inc-nyse-100245967.html,1691402565,STORY,['UPS'],"[It looks like United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase United Parcel Service's shares on or after the 11th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 31st of August.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.62 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$6.48 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, United Parcel Service has a trailing yield of 3.6% on the current stock price of $180.94. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. United Parcel Service paid out a comfortable 50% of its profit last year. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether United Parcel Service generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 72% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that United Parcel Service's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, United Parcel Service's earnings per share have been growing at 17% a year for the past five years. United Parcel Service has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, United Parcel Service has increased its dividend at approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid United Parcel Service? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, United Parcel Service paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.While it's tempting to invest in United Parcel Service for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example - United Parcel Service has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

""Through the monthly noise, inflation appears set on a downward path. However, progress in the coming months is likely to be slower and noisier than June's print alone would suggest.""Wells Fargo expects to see that headline prices rose 3.3% and ""core"" inflation jumped 4.7% over last year.This report will serve as the latest piece of what will be a robust set of data presented to the Fed before their next policy decision on September 20.The July jobs report on Friday showed the US economy added 187,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%. Wages were firmer than forecast, rising 4.4% over last year, but some economists expect that in light of increased worker productivity, the Fed is unlikely to see this as an additional inflation impulse.Story continuesBob Schwartz, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said on Friday the jobs report had ""something for everyone.""""Simply put, the latest jobs report is as close to a Goldilocks outcome as could be hoped,"" Schwartz added. ""For one, it pushes recession fears further onto the back burner. ... For another, the jobs report provides encouraging news for inflation doves, who believe the Fed should take its finger off the rate-hiking trigger.""Outside of inflation data this week, the economic calendar will feature the NFIB's small business optimism report, the University of Michigan's check on consumer sentiment, and data on producer prices.On the corporate side, Disney results will be the week's biggest earnings update, with investors asking tough questions about the streaming and TV business as subscriber growth slows while Hollywood strikes pressure production and bring the entertainment world into the AI fray.Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the ""Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny"" red carpet event at Palais des Festivals on May 18, 2023, in Cannes, France. (Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)As earnings season has rolled along, AI updates from across the corporate world have been abundant.Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban noted Friday that with earnings for the biggest tech companies behind us, not all leaders took the same tactic toward hyping AI advances.Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon were the most forceful in touting their AI prospects, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple struck a more measured tone.Apple CEO Tim Cook downplayed AI plans, telling analysts on Thursday, ""We tend to announce things as they come to market, and that's our M.O. and I'd like to stick to that."" Meanwhile, Amazon executives said ""generative AI"" no fewer than 20 times on their earnings call Thursday evening.Apple stock fell 5% on Friday after a third straight quarter of revenue declines and a larger-than-expected drop in iPhone sales hit shares. Amazon gained more than 8% after results in its Amazon Web Services business showed revenue growth slowed less than expected.Results from UPS (UPS), Palantir (PLTR), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Lyft (LYFT) will also feature this week as earnings season winds down.Source: Yahoo FinanceData from FactSet published Friday showed that through last week, 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported results with blended earnings for the index — which includes companies reporting and forecasts for those still to come — pointing to a 5.2% drop in earnings per share from last year. This will mark the third straight quarter of earnings declines.And while 79% of companies that have released earnings are beating forecasts, which is more than the 10-year average of 73%, investors have judged results harshly this quarter.FactSet's data showed companies reporting results better than forecasts during this earnings season are seeing their stock drop 0.5% during the period covering the two days before and after the report. Over the last five years, the average change for a company's stock over this period has been a 1% gain on positive numbers.With the market having rallied so aggressively this year — and that rally broadening in June and July across all 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 — second quarter earnings season has become a ""sell the news"" event.Weekly calendarMondayEarnings: Palantir (PLTR), Beyond Meat (BYND), Chegg (CHGG), Lucid Group (LCID), Paramount Global (PARA), RingCentral (RING), KKR (KKR), Tyson Foods (TSN), Skyworks (SWKS)Economic data: Consumer credit, June (+$14 billion, $7.24 billion previously)TuesdayEarnings: UPS (UPS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Twilio (TWLO), Bumble (BMBL), Rivian (RIVN), Capri Holdings (CPRI), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Lyft (LYFT), Restaurant Brands (QSR), Novavax (NVAX), Under Armour (UAA), Warner Music Group (WMG), Li Auto (LI), Fox Corp (FOXA), Celsius (CELH), Blink Charging (BLNK), Duolingo (DUO), Dutch Bros (BROS)Economic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, July (90.5 expected, 91.0 previously); Trade balance, June (-$65 billion expected, -$69 billion previously); Wholesale trade sales, June (-0.2% previously); Wholesale trade inventories, June (-0.3% previously)WednesdayEarnings: Disney (DIS), Roblox (RBLX), Warby Parker (WRBY), The Trade Desk (TTD), Jack In The Box (JACK), GoodRx (GDRX), PENN Entertainment (PENN), Stratasys (SSYS), Valvoline (VVV), Reynolds (REYN) Illumina (ILMN)Economic data: MBA Weekly Mortgage Applications (-3% previously)ThursdayEarnings: Alibaba (BABA), Ralph Lauren (RL), YETI Holdings (YETI), Wolverine World Wide (WWW), Utz Brands (UTZ), Krispy Kreme (DNUT), Six Flags (SIX), Hanesbrands (HBI), Dillard's (DDS), Flowers Foods (FLO), News Corp.

91,38750a24-6f4d-38ea-b0ac-2df9facedea9,AXP,2023-08-07,Investors in American Express (NYSE:AXP) have seen favorable returns of 69% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-american-express-nyse-axp-110102886.html,1691406062,STORY,['AXP'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 63% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 27% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 6.7% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for American Express While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.American Express was able to grow its EPS at 27% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 3 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican Express shareholders are up 6.7% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 12% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:RMD) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for ResMed Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.03bUS$1.20bUS$1.37bUS$1.46bUS$1.36bUS$1.30bUS$1.27bUS$1.26bUS$1.26bUS$1.27bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -4.13%Est @ -2.26%Est @ -0.95%Est @ -0.03%Est @ 0.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$960US$1.0kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$943US$841US$764US$703US$654US$612(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.7bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$11bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$179, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ResMed as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.918. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ResMedStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For ResMed, we've put together three essential aspects you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

But some of its beans, known as unwashed or 'natural' arabicas, have not previously been used for high-end benchmark coffee contracts around the world.Now, global traders are adding these increasingly tasty Brazilian beans to the bags used to settle these contracts, five traders told Reuters, marking a previously unreported structural change set to weigh on world coffee prices in the long-term, the traders and four others in the industry said.Brazil's coffee exporters association Cecafe confirmed these beans were now being included in exchange stocks, saying it was in recognition of their improved taste and quality.The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) did not answer a question about whether it was aware of the change in the types of beans backing its contracts, but said the exchange's grading process was designed to protect standards.""Samples that present an unwashed flavor in the cup will fail grading"", ICE said in a statement.While the news could bring welcome relief to taste-conscious consumers battling food price inflation, it spells more gloom on long-struggling Latin American and African farms where coffee trees grow on steep, shaded slopes unsuitable for Brazilian-style harvesting vehicles.""We are in danger"", said Dagoberto Suazo, president of the Central de Cooperativas Cafetaleras in Honduras, asked by Reuters about the new development.""Producers in Honduras are 95% small scale. It's not that we're going to disappear, but poverty is going to increase"", he said.Story continues'IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK'The Coffee C Futures contract on the ICE exchange has traditionally reflected premium grade coffee, known as washed arabica because of a technique using water to remove coffee's red fruit from the bean.Washed beans from Africa, Colombia, Central America and Peru have long been valued for superior flavour. Over time, however, Brazilian farmers have improved the taste of their unwashed and semi-washed coffee.Late last year, significant volumes of Brazil's unwashed grades started to appear along with semi-washed grades in bags sent to the exchange so they can be used to settle its contracts, four of the traders said. The traders declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.Currently about 30% of approved stock sitting in ICE warehouses comes from Brazil, data shows. The four traders estimated that almost all those bags include unwashed grades, and one trader said some bags contain almost entirely unwashed.Although ICE price contracts are meant to represent the value of premium-grade arabicas, its rules do not expressly forbid officials from approving unwashed arabicas for contract settlement.They simply state that approved beans should be free from 'unwashed flavours'. Unwashed coffee is so-called because its fruit is left to dry whole before the bean is extracted.Given that ICE officials approve beans mainly on the basis of taste, they are often unable to detect 'unwashed flavours' in the best of Brazil's lower grade arabicas, especially if they're mixed with premium grades, a Europe-based coffee market expert working for a leading trade house said.""It's very difficult to pick a top-of-the-range unwashed from a semi-washed. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then, erm, it's a duck,"" a veteran Swiss-based global coffee trader said.Marcio Ferreira, president of Brazil's coffee exporters association Cecafe said the quality and sustainability of all Brazilian coffees have been improving for years.""ICE has their standards established for each origin and each lot is subject to quality approval,"" he said. ""We understand that if each lot has its quality approved ... it is because it fits established quality parameters"", Ferreira said.He added that relatively little Brazilian coffee ends up in ICE warehouses because it usually fetches higher prices in the physical markets.Most ICE-certified arabica is owned by leading global trade houses Sucafina and Louis Dreyfus, the five traders said.The two companies declined to comment on whether they had got a mix of semi-washed and unwashed beans certified by ICE. A source at Sucafina said it had only shipped 100% semi-washed coffee to the exchange for certification.LATENT THREATThe large-scale arrival of Brazilian beans at ICE warehouses has been a latent threat for arabica producers since 2013, when the exchange first allowed semi-premium beans from Brazil to be used to settle its premium grade arabica contracts.This surge initially didn't come to pass because there was not much spare premium coffee around so traders were able to get higher prices selling even semi-premium beans to roasters in the physical markets.Starting in 2020, however, Brazilian beans began to arrive en masse and then, in late 2022, they came despite the fact that semi-premium grades were at the time fetching higher prices in the physical markets.This led some traders to suspect that cheaper unwashed beans had been mixed in, three of the traders said, adding they had confirmed the suspicions with counterparts in Brazil.ICE - a market of last resort where excess coffee is guaranteed to fetch a price - releases daily stocks data on how many bags of beans approved for settling out price contracts it holds.Given this tally - seen as a proxy for excess global coffee supply - is visible to all, ICE contracts usually come under pressure when the amount of stock that backs them increases.""The market needs to realise that we could see, (in) years of surplus, lots of (mixed grade) Brazils come to the exchange,"" said the Europe-based coffee market expert.STAGNATING FOR YEARSDespite a growing world population that is increasingly keen on coffee, especially premium-grade arabicas, output of this grade in top producer Central America has been stagnating since around the turn of the century.Much of the reason for this has to do with price.According to Reuters data, ICE arabica price futures traded at around $1.75 per lb in early 1980, more than 10% higher in nominal terms than today's levels.Zooming out to inflation adjusted terms however, coffee prices in 1980 were equivalent to about $8 per lb - a whopping 500% higher than they are today, according to Reuters calculations.Small farmers in Central America and beyond struggle to turn a profit at today's prices as they lack economies of scale for labour, seedlings, fertilizer and pesticide.Even in years where margins move into positive territory, the volumes they produce are low, so profits made on relatively few bags of coffee often don't translate into a living wage.As a result, coffee farmers in Central America often head off to the southern U.S. border when their fortunes tank for successive years.In Honduras, Pedro Mendoza, president of the national coffee institute IHCAFE, said there was little that can be done in practice to 'decommoditise' the way global coffee is priced.""The sector could (ultimately) be left in the hands of large producers"", he said.(Reporting by Maytaal Angel in London and Gustavo Palencia in Tegucigalpa.

Just one week after its release, the film has grossed nearly $500 million worldwide, including $214 million at the North American box office. The movie about the iconic Barbie and Ken dolls made by toy company Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) has struck a chord with audiences and is helping to revive box office fortunes that were devastated during the Covid-19 pandemic. The domestic box office that includes the U.S. and Canada generated $1.8 billion of sales in the first three months of this year, which was 25% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Box office distributors and film studios are hoping Barbie can lead to higher grosses throughout the remainder of summer.However, it is not just the box office where Barbie is having an impact. Many other economic sectors are getting a boost, notably the fashion industry as people dress up like Barbie and Ken to attend screenings of the film. Here are three fashion stocks worth buying for the Barbie boost.Ralph Lauren (RL)A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.Source: Martin Good / Shutterstock.comBarbie and Ken are preppy fashion icons, and there is no company more associated with the preppy look than Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL). The company that popularized the polo shirt has been on a tear lately, with its stock up 35% over the last 12 months — including an 18% gain in 2023. With consumer spending holding strong, especially among affluent Americans, it has benefitted Ralph Lauren. At the end of May, the company posted an impressive first-quarter earnings beat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe fashion retailer announced Q1 earnings per share of 90 cents, which beat consensus forecasts of 65 cents. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1.54 billion, which was better than the $1.52 billion that had been expected on Wall Street. Ralph Lauren also boasts a strong balance sheet, with $1.5 billion of cash and only $1.1 billion of long-term debt at the end of March. Trading at 16 times forward earnings, RL stock looks reasonably valued. And, the stock pays a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share, which is good for a yield of 2.34%.Story continuesLululemon Athletica (LULU)A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comBoth Ken and Barbie like to stay fit and hang out at the beach. And what better wardrobe for those activities than Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)? The athletic apparel retailer that caused a sensation with its yoga pants and other workout gear has seen its stock perform strongly over many years. LULU shares have increased 16% this year, 27% in the last 12 months, and 213% over five years. The company continues to ride the enduring popularity of its athletic wear to new heights.The company’s latest fashion sensation is its bestselling “Everywhere Belt Bag.” Essentially a fanny pack worn like a purse, the belt bag has gone viral and become a social media sensation. The company’s ability to successfully market different products and make many of the items it sells viral sensations has contributed to its success. At the start of June, LULU stock jumped 15% on a Q1 earnings beat. The company announced that its revenue rose 24% in Q1 to $2 billion, sending Wall Street analysts scrambling to revise their forecasts on the stock.

With more than 35,000 employees, Ulta Beauty has been growing at a quick rate, pushing its share price up in the process. ULTA stock has increased 14% in the last 12 months and is up 80% over the past five years.However, ULTA stock has dipped recently and is 18% below its 52-week high, presenting a decent entry point for investors. Despite the share price drop, Ulta Beauty continues to attract consumers, reporting customer traffic rose 11% in its most recent quarter. The company also enjoys a high profit margin of 17% versus just 6% among other retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT). And, unlike competing cosmetic companies such as Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), Ulta Beauty does not have a lot of exposure to China, where consumer sales are waning.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

100,406dfab1-0ddf-355a-a2be-03592a722d0f,PGR,2023-08-07,Another Rate Hike! 7 Stocks to Buy Following the Fed’s Latest Move,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-rate-hike-7-stocks-191825622.html,1690831105,STORY,"['IBM', 'FIVE', 'PGR', 'AWK', 'PRTS']","[In a not exactly unexpected development, the Federal Reserve last week announced that it raised its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, which then inherently bolsters the case for stocks to buy after a rate hike. Primarily, investors shouldn’t expect much relief from policymakers. Therefore, investors must at least consider publicly traded enterprises that have a chance of performing well under rising borrowing costs.For one thing, a Bloomberg report noted that the central bank left the door open for more rate hikes. This framework too isn’t all that surprising. While recent data suggests that inflation may be trending in the right direction (as in downward), the Fed targets a 2% inflation rate. We are well off from that key level, meaning that investors should consider rate hike-resistant stocks.Second and on a related note, policymakers have a long-term goal of decisively curbing inflation to avoid lasting economic damage. They’re not going to be satisfied with encouraging blips here and there. Subsequently, the assumption among market participants for the Fed rate hike investment strategy should center on a hawkish tone. Simply, the central bank isn’t done tightening the money supply.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that, below are stocks to invest in a post-rate hike.Progressive (PGR)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFor stocks to buy after a rate hike, investors should focus on businesses that people can’t live without. For that, I’ve got to go with the obvious name in Progressive (NYSE:PGR). As an insurance juggernaut – particularly for the automotive side – Progressive enjoys economic insulation. Almost every state in the Union requires drivers to carry coverage.Bluntly speaking, for the jurisdictions that don’t, you better. Let’s just be honest – driving without insurance (especially these days) is just about the stupidest thing you can do. And while many companies compete in this sector, Progressive has a brand awareness edge. Thanks to its many years of quirky advertisements – particularly with the fictional salesperson Flo – the brand is ingrained into the collective consciousness.Story continuesNow, financially, PGR doesn’t initially seem to justify inclusion on this list of rate hike-resistant stocks. Certainly, some of the stats could use some serious shoring up. However, it enjoys decent long-term revenue growth and is consistently profitable. The pertinent nature of the business takes care of the rest.American Water Works (AWK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAgain, when you’re talking about stocks to buy after a rate hike, you must think cynically. In my view, few ideas offer contextual cynicism than American Water Works (NYSE:AWK). By that, I don’t have anything against the water and wastewater services firm. Rather, American Water enjoys a hostage audience. No matter what happens in the economy, households must pay their core utility bills.As well, we can be brutally honest about the narrative associated with a Fed rate hike investment strategy. You want to target indelible businesses. It doesn’t get much more indelible than AWK. Households will cut all kinds of discretionary purchases to make sure they pay their utility bills. Otherwise, if they don’t prioritize their utilities, they just wouldn’t be able to get by.Under this context, I’m not particularly worried about AWK’s financial warts. Sure, it carries more debt than I’d like to see. It’s also overvalued against projected earnings. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to invest in post-rate hikes.Five Below (FIVE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Frankly, I can propose several market ideas for discount retailers on this list of stocks to buy after a rate hike. However, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) at this juncture makes the most sense to me. Sure, there are “true” dollar stores out there. However, the consumer economy isn’t that desperate yet. We know this because the latest jobs report still indicates a broadly tight labor market.Once the labor market slackens and more workers than employment opportunities materialize, then we can talk about literal dollar stores. For now, Five Below presents a very attractive case because of its higher price point. Typically specializing in products priced at $5 – with some jumping to $25 – Five Below represents a bargain hunter’s arena that all consumers can enjoy, not just the desperate.As for the financial point of view, I must admit that FIVE trades at a rich earnings premium. However, we’re also talking about a growth machine. More importantly, its trailing-year net margin stands at 8.42%, above 81.35% of cyclical retailers. It’s a strong candidate for resilient stocks after Fed moves.IBM (IBM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comPersonally, InvestorPlace readers may be tired of hearing me sing the praises of IBM (NYSE:IBM). We get it, the company used to focus on increasingly irrelevant businesses, I hear you say. Now, it shifted priorities to relevant and burgeoning sectors, such as hybrid cloud networks. What else have you got to bring to the table?Well, I’m afraid, not much. Look, IBM may be a boring entity when it comes to tech plays. However, under the specific context of stocks to buy after a rate hike, it makes plenty of sense. From artificial intelligence to cybersecurity to even blockchain applications, IBM commands significant acumen. And I’m not even touching the entire spectrum of the firm’s utility.Even better, IBM can help investors navigate the higher borrowing cost environment. In addition to its broad relevancies, “Big Blue” also carries a big forward yield of 4.63%. As well, it enjoys a track record of 30 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. If that wasn’t enough, IBM also trades at a forward earnings multiple of 15.13. That’s ranked lower than 75% of its peers.CarParts.com (PRTS)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comJust like its corporate name suggests, CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) is an online provider of aftermarket auto parts, including collision parts, engine parts, and performance parts and accessories. While the enterprise offers everyday relevance, here’s the thing: PRTS is terribly risky. Since the start of this year, shares tumbled nearly 21%. In the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up 38% of its equity value.So, why the [expletive] should investors consider PRTS as one of the stocks to buy after a rate hike? Fundamentally, CarParts.com offers a profound upside narrative. According to the AP, American consumers have been repelled by high car prices. Therefore, folks are holding onto their vehicles longer than ever.Citing data from S&amp;P Global Mobility, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit a record 12.5 years. Personally, I’ve been keeping tabs on this stat and the figure just keeps rising. Essentially, CarParts.com enjoys a burgeoning market that may be more favorable than initially anticipated.Thus, when an investment data aggregator pegs PRTS as significantly undervalued, I’m inclined to believe it. The hard data makes PRTS one of the stocks to invest in a post-rate hike.United Rentals (URI)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comBoth sensible and risky at the same time, investors with a penchant for mild speculation may consider United Rentals (NYSE:URI). Founded in 1997, United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, per its website. Its store network pings nearly three times the size of any other provider. As well, the company features a presence in 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces.In my opinion, it’s also one of the stocks to buy after a rate hike. Given the monetary policy environment along with a questionable economic backdrop, industry players might not want to risk purchasing equipment outright. During periods of uncertainty, some companies may find renting to be a more appropriate course of action.Financially, URI cuts a different profile from some of the other ideas for the Fed rate hike investment strategy. Basically, United enjoys an attractive print. For example, it features a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 10.9%, above 70.4% of its peers.Moreover, its net margin clocks in at 17.34%, leading to consistent profitability. Lastly, URI trades at a forward earnings multiple of 11.35, which is conspicuously undervalued. Thus, it’s one of the resilient stocks after Fed moves.HF Sinclair (DINO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhile hydrocarbon energy specialist HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) might not immediately seem like a relevant case for safe dividend stocks for 2023, investors would be making a mistake in ignoring it. Sure, we can talk all day about the future of mobility belonging to electric vehicles. That future is far off into the distance.We know that immediate electrification is a pipe dream first because of infrastructure. Basically, several parts of the U.S. will require a total overhaul of the power grid. If we can’t handle air conditioners running during a hot summer day, EVs won’t make resilience issues any better.Another point is the consumer economy. As stated earlier, inflation has caused households to hold onto their vehicles for longer. Here, we’re almost always talking about combustion-powered vehicles. Therefore, as long as consumers feel pressured, HF Sinclair should enjoy cynical relevance.Finally, the market prices DINO at a forward multiple of 6.99. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 63.27% of its oil and gas peers. Subsequently, it’s a wonderful idea for rate hike-resistant stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:EL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-est-e-lauder-companies-120018125.html,1691409618,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$247 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$171. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Estée Lauder Companies' current trading price of US$171 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What Is Estée Lauder Companies Worth?According to my valuation model, Estée Lauder Companies seems to be fairly priced at around 5.5% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Estée Lauder Companies today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $180.64, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Estée Lauder Companies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Estée Lauder Companies?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Estée Lauder Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

CHD, The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG and Colgate-Palmolive CL.Industry: Cleaning SuppliesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2132632/4-soaps-cleaning-materials-stocks-to-gain-as-industry-catches-onPlayers in the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry have been benefiting from solid demand for consumer products and brands, strong operational execution and expansion into new markets. Robust pricing initiatives have been vital in boosting sales for industry participants. The companies remain focused on digital commerce growth, product innovation and brand building strategies.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending have been denting profitability. Companies like Unilever PLC, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc., The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Colgate-Palmolive have resorted to cost-curtailment actions to counter cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies manufacturing and supplying fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items.Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the ones mentioned above. A few players also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores, pet stores and websites.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryFavorable Demand &amp; Pricing Actions: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing revived demand trends across markets. The industry participants have been benefiting from solid demand for products and brands, stemming from continued brand relevance. Gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives are also driving organic sales for several industry players.The companies have been adopting bold pricing initiatives across markets to combat rising costs due to the persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes. The cost-based pricing actions have been boosting the margin and profitability of several industry players.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: The companies frequently invest in product development to cater to the consumers’ changing needs. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving companies' sales in the soaps and cleaning products space. Players have been undertaking pricing, packaging, marketing initiatives and restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures.Companies also remain focused on expanding into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The increase in popularity of online shopping, particularly after the pandemic, has been another key sales driver for the industry participants.This has led the companies to constantly step up their efforts in the e-commerce arena through improved delivery and payment systems. Consumer goods companies are also undertaking productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.Rising Costs a Concern: The industry participants are experiencing supply-chain disruptions, logistic issues and inflation in raw materials and other expenses, which have been weighing on their margins and profitability. Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs and increased advertising and sales promotion expenses are other factors impacting margins.Also, several companies are subject to higher SG&amp;A expenses due to increased operational costs related to salaries and bonuses and planned investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. Some players focus on cost-containment initiatives, including streamlining the supply chain and minimizing overhead costs to improve margins. Most companies are resorting to price increases to cushion their margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

106,406dfab1-0ddf-355a-a2be-03592a722d0f,AWK,2023-08-07,Another Rate Hike! 7 Stocks to Buy Following the Fed’s Latest Move,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-rate-hike-7-stocks-191825622.html,1690831105,STORY,"['IBM', 'FIVE', 'PGR', 'AWK', 'PRTS']","[In a not exactly unexpected development, the Federal Reserve last week announced that it raised its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, which then inherently bolsters the case for stocks to buy after a rate hike. Primarily, investors shouldn’t expect much relief from policymakers. Therefore, investors must at least consider publicly traded enterprises that have a chance of performing well under rising borrowing costs.For one thing, a Bloomberg report noted that the central bank left the door open for more rate hikes. This framework too isn’t all that surprising. While recent data suggests that inflation may be trending in the right direction (as in downward), the Fed targets a 2% inflation rate. We are well off from that key level, meaning that investors should consider rate hike-resistant stocks.Second and on a related note, policymakers have a long-term goal of decisively curbing inflation to avoid lasting economic damage. They’re not going to be satisfied with encouraging blips here and there. Subsequently, the assumption among market participants for the Fed rate hike investment strategy should center on a hawkish tone. Simply, the central bank isn’t done tightening the money supply.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that, below are stocks to invest in a post-rate hike.Progressive (PGR)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comFor stocks to buy after a rate hike, investors should focus on businesses that people can’t live without. For that, I’ve got to go with the obvious name in Progressive (NYSE:PGR). As an insurance juggernaut – particularly for the automotive side – Progressive enjoys economic insulation. Almost every state in the Union requires drivers to carry coverage.Bluntly speaking, for the jurisdictions that don’t, you better. Let’s just be honest – driving without insurance (especially these days) is just about the stupidest thing you can do. And while many companies compete in this sector, Progressive has a brand awareness edge. Thanks to its many years of quirky advertisements – particularly with the fictional salesperson Flo – the brand is ingrained into the collective consciousness.Story continuesNow, financially, PGR doesn’t initially seem to justify inclusion on this list of rate hike-resistant stocks. Certainly, some of the stats could use some serious shoring up. However, it enjoys decent long-term revenue growth and is consistently profitable. The pertinent nature of the business takes care of the rest.American Water Works (AWK)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAgain, when you’re talking about stocks to buy after a rate hike, you must think cynically. In my view, few ideas offer contextual cynicism than American Water Works (NYSE:AWK). By that, I don’t have anything against the water and wastewater services firm. Rather, American Water enjoys a hostage audience. No matter what happens in the economy, households must pay their core utility bills.As well, we can be brutally honest about the narrative associated with a Fed rate hike investment strategy. You want to target indelible businesses. It doesn’t get much more indelible than AWK. Households will cut all kinds of discretionary purchases to make sure they pay their utility bills. Otherwise, if they don’t prioritize their utilities, they just wouldn’t be able to get by.Under this context, I’m not particularly worried about AWK’s financial warts. Sure, it carries more debt than I’d like to see. It’s also overvalued against projected earnings. However, it’s consistently profitable, making it one of the stocks to invest in post-rate hikes.Five Below (FIVE)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Frankly, I can propose several market ideas for discount retailers on this list of stocks to buy after a rate hike. However, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) at this juncture makes the most sense to me. Sure, there are “true” dollar stores out there. However, the consumer economy isn’t that desperate yet. We know this because the latest jobs report still indicates a broadly tight labor market.Once the labor market slackens and more workers than employment opportunities materialize, then we can talk about literal dollar stores. For now, Five Below presents a very attractive case because of its higher price point. Typically specializing in products priced at $5 – with some jumping to $25 – Five Below represents a bargain hunter’s arena that all consumers can enjoy, not just the desperate.As for the financial point of view, I must admit that FIVE trades at a rich earnings premium. However, we’re also talking about a growth machine. More importantly, its trailing-year net margin stands at 8.42%, above 81.35% of cyclical retailers. It’s a strong candidate for resilient stocks after Fed moves.IBM (IBM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comPersonally, InvestorPlace readers may be tired of hearing me sing the praises of IBM (NYSE:IBM). We get it, the company used to focus on increasingly irrelevant businesses, I hear you say. Now, it shifted priorities to relevant and burgeoning sectors, such as hybrid cloud networks. What else have you got to bring to the table?Well, I’m afraid, not much. Look, IBM may be a boring entity when it comes to tech plays. However, under the specific context of stocks to buy after a rate hike, it makes plenty of sense. From artificial intelligence to cybersecurity to even blockchain applications, IBM commands significant acumen. And I’m not even touching the entire spectrum of the firm’s utility.Even better, IBM can help investors navigate the higher borrowing cost environment. In addition to its broad relevancies, “Big Blue” also carries a big forward yield of 4.63%. As well, it enjoys a track record of 30 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. If that wasn’t enough, IBM also trades at a forward earnings multiple of 15.13. That’s ranked lower than 75% of its peers.CarParts.com (PRTS)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comJust like its corporate name suggests, CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) is an online provider of aftermarket auto parts, including collision parts, engine parts, and performance parts and accessories. While the enterprise offers everyday relevance, here’s the thing: PRTS is terribly risky. Since the start of this year, shares tumbled nearly 21%. In the trailing one-year period, PRTS gave up 38% of its equity value.So, why the [expletive] should investors consider PRTS as one of the stocks to buy after a rate hike? Fundamentally, CarParts.com offers a profound upside narrative. According to the AP, American consumers have been repelled by high car prices. Therefore, folks are holding onto their vehicles longer than ever.Citing data from S&amp;P Global Mobility, the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit a record 12.5 years. Personally, I’ve been keeping tabs on this stat and the figure just keeps rising. Essentially, CarParts.com enjoys a burgeoning market that may be more favorable than initially anticipated.Thus, when an investment data aggregator pegs PRTS as significantly undervalued, I’m inclined to believe it. The hard data makes PRTS one of the stocks to invest in a post-rate hike.United Rentals (URI)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comBoth sensible and risky at the same time, investors with a penchant for mild speculation may consider United Rentals (NYSE:URI). Founded in 1997, United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, per its website. Its store network pings nearly three times the size of any other provider. As well, the company features a presence in 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces.In my opinion, it’s also one of the stocks to buy after a rate hike. Given the monetary policy environment along with a questionable economic backdrop, industry players might not want to risk purchasing equipment outright. During periods of uncertainty, some companies may find renting to be a more appropriate course of action.Financially, URI cuts a different profile from some of the other ideas for the Fed rate hike investment strategy. Basically, United enjoys an attractive print. For example, it features a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 10.9%, above 70.4% of its peers.Moreover, its net margin clocks in at 17.34%, leading to consistent profitability. Lastly, URI trades at a forward earnings multiple of 11.35, which is conspicuously undervalued. Thus, it’s one of the resilient stocks after Fed moves.HF Sinclair (DINO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comWhile hydrocarbon energy specialist HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) might not immediately seem like a relevant case for safe dividend stocks for 2023, investors would be making a mistake in ignoring it. Sure, we can talk all day about the future of mobility belonging to electric vehicles. That future is far off into the distance.We know that immediate electrification is a pipe dream first because of infrastructure. Basically, several parts of the U.S. will require a total overhaul of the power grid. If we can’t handle air conditioners running during a hot summer day, EVs won’t make resilience issues any better.Another point is the consumer economy. As stated earlier, inflation has caused households to hold onto their vehicles for longer. Here, we’re almost always talking about combustion-powered vehicles. Therefore, as long as consumers feel pressured, HF Sinclair should enjoy cynical relevance.Finally, the market prices DINO at a forward multiple of 6.99. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 63.27% of its oil and gas peers. Subsequently, it’s a wonderful idea for rate hike-resistant stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
