""At TI, we are innovating to enable new capabilities in embedded design while reducing system cost and complexity.""Cost and complexity: Key challenges for embedded systems Balancing cost and complexity of the system remains a key design challenge. Making electronics more affordable requires constant innovation and focus to squeeze the best feature set into the smallest cost envelope. Solving the cost and complexity challenge requires both hardware and software optimization to create the most elegant and efficient design. Choosing embedded solutions which allow re-use of software across multiple performance and cost points is key for companies to bring to market the maximum number of new products in the shortest amount of time.The promise of edge AI and next-generation embedded designs, and the tools to scaleIntelligence at the edge is transformational and can help make the world smarter, safer and more automated. Edge AI computing reduces data transmission latency and saves on cloud computing costs, enabling more timely decisions and responses in electronics.To enable designers to bring these benefits to more systems, TI offers a portfolio of embedded products with scalable edge AI processing capabilities. In addition to the scalable device portfolio, TI is also working to bring down the barrier to entry for mainstream machine learning in embedded systems. To support application development, TI offers the Edge AI Studio which allows a ""no-code"" approach to adding AI capability to customer systems.Story continuesAbout Texas Instruments Texas Instruments Incorporated (Nasdaq: TXN) is a global semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, tests, and sells analog and embedded processing chips for markets such as industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems.

Not every pick can be a winner, but when you pick the right stock, you can win big. For example, the Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) share price is up a whopping 330% in the last three years, a handsome return for long term holders. On the other hand, the stock price has retraced 5.8% in the last week.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 5.8%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Range Resources To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Range Resources became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Range Resources the TSR over the last 3 years was 334%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 1.7% in the last year, Range Resources shareholders lost 18% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Range Resources better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Range Resources  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This benefits the upstream operation of Range Resources, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In Appalachia, RRC has decades of low-risk drilling inventory, brightening its production outlook. The company has lower well costs per lateral foot than many other upstream players.The firm has a strong focus on strengthening its balance sheet. Over the past few years, RRC has been reducing its debt load almost consistently. On a positive note, the company has the lowest emission intensity among the upstream companies in the United States.RisksIn spite of the positive factors, RRC’s overall operations are significantly exposed to extreme oil and natural gas price volatility.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked players in the energy space include Murphy USA Inc.

TLYS is likely to register a top- and bottom-line decrease from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s tallies when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers numbers on Jun 1, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $126.8 million, indicating a decline of 13% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings currently stands at a loss of 33 cents a share for the fiscal first quarter, suggesting a decrease from earnings of 3 cents per share reported in the year-earlier fiscal quarter. The consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.This specialty retailer of apparel, footwear and accessories boasts a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 64.4%, on average.Key Aspects to NoteTilly’s first-quarter results are likely to have been hurt by the impacts of a tough operating environment comprising inflationary pressures, evolving customer spending behaviors and foreign currency headwinds. These along with any deleverage in selling and administrative expenses and other costs are likely to have hurt its overall results in the quarter under review.    On its last earnings call, management had highlighted that total comparable net sales through Mar 7, 2023, including both physical stores and e-com, fell 19.9% year over year. The company said that its first-quarter results are expected to have been hurt by the weather. Tilly’s had estimated first-quarter net sales of $122-$133 million and SG&amp;A expenses of $43-$44 million.

8,6509a25d-a7cf-3595-a7e2-7e8c27d5d76a,PVH,2023-05-31,What Makes PVH (PVH) a New Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-pvh-pvh-buy-stock-160007180.html,1685462407,STORY,['PVH'],"[PVH (PVH) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for PVH is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for PVH imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PVHFor the fiscal year ending January 2024, this owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands is expected to earn $10.03 per share, which is a change of 11.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PVH. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of PVH to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ZUMZ is likely to post a decrease in the top and the bottom line from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figures in its first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Jun 1, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales is pegged at $182 million, indicating a decline of 17.5% from the last fiscal-year period’s tally.The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at a loss of 87 cents a share, wider than a loss of 2 cents per share from the year-ago fiscal period’s tally. The consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.This Lynnwood, WA-based player witnessed an average negative earnings surprise of 15.6% in the trailing four quarters.Key Factors to NoteZumiez’s quarterly performance is likely to have been hurt by a challenging operating landscape, including numerous issues like inflationary pressures, a tight labor market, increased operating costs and foreign currency headwinds. Any deleverage in selling, general and administrative costs are likely to have been added deterrents.On its last earnings call, management highlighted that the first quarter to date results are likely to have remained consistent with the fourth-quarter 2022 results and are expected to have been impacted by higher inflationary pressures in discretionary spending. It projected first-quarter total sales between $178 million and $184 million, and product margins are expected to be down 100-115 basis points year over year. The company had anticipated consolidated operating loss as a rate of sales for the same quarter to be in the range of 10.7-12.7% and loss per share to be in the range of 85-95 cents.Management had earlier said that net sales for the fiscal first quarter to date for 35 days ended Mar 4, 2023, tumbled 15.5% from the year-ago fiscal period. Total comparable sales for the aforementioned period declined 16.6% from the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. From a regional perspective, net sales for the North America business fell 21.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally in the 35-day period, while the metric at the international business increased 13.9% from last fiscal year’s quarterly level. Excluding foreign currency impacts, North American sales were down 21.7% while the other international sales grew 19.2%.For the aforementioned period, all categories were down in comparable sales from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. The mens category remained the most negative one, followed by women's, footwear, accessories and hard goods.On the positive front, Zumiez’s consumer-centric approach and merchandise initiatives remain encouraging. ZUMZ’s store expansion and omnichannel efforts are other positives. These positives are likely to have provided some cushion to the quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Zumiez this time around.

(NYSE:TMO) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-thermo-fisher-scientific-120027592.html,1685534427,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsThermo Fisher Scientific's estimated fair value is US$388 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityThermo Fisher Scientific's US$514 share price signals that it might be 32% overvaluedOur fair value estimate is 38% lower than Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst price target of US$628In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.87bUS$8.61bUS$9.48bUS$9.58bUS$9.71bUS$9.86bUS$10.0bUS$10.2bUS$10.4bUS$10.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x2Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.58%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.93%Est @ 1.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$6.4kUS$7.4kUS$7.5kUS$7.1kUS$6.6kUS$6.2kUS$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.2kUS$5.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$63bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$186bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$186b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$150b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$514, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.980. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

In 22 years at Starbucks he has broadened his experience beyond marketing and the U.S., with five years in Hong Kong and three years in Tokyo as chief operating officer of Starbucks Japan.

A graduate of famed military school the Citadel, Rawlinson went on to Harvard for an MBA and then to positions in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Prior to his appointment as Qurate’s CEO in 2021, Rawlinson shepherded NielsenIQ, a retail and consumer goods data company, through its spinoff from Nielsen’s TV ratings arm. And when he was president of online sales at industrial supplies company W.W. Grainger, he was key to building its e-commerce business. Greg Maffei, executive chairman of Qurate Retail, said it was Rawlinson’s ability to bring an “outside perspective to a well-established business” that made him the person to lead Qurate.—Paolo ConfinoVery unconventionalAndrew MacDonald SVP, Mobility at Uber photographed at Uber HQ in San Francisco on Monday May 8, 2023.

Macdonald, 39, oversees the company’s rideshare business globally, as well as other divisions including car sharing and micromobility (bikes and scooters). The company has greatly disrupted the taxi industry since its founding in 2009, but Macdonald has spearheaded efforts to collaborate with the industry, aiming to list every NYC taxi—and then every taxi in the world—on Uber.—Paige McGlauflinEric Glyman, CEO of Ramp Courtesy of RampEric GlymanCofounder and CEORampGlyman, 33, cofounded Ramp in 2019 with a simple idea: offer companies a corporate credit card and software designed to help them spend less.

Ramp helps employers direct and monitor what employees spend and speeds up expense reports and accounting for end-of-month closings. Ramp’s most recent private investment round, in March 2022, valued the company at $8.1 billion.

Shareholders, and various other guests, are also expected to hear about the company investing heavily in new automation, the opening recently of its first Arkansas market fulfillment center, and progress on new ventures like the retailer's ad business, called Walmart Connect.There's lots of good news to talk about. Earlier this month, the retail giant posted first quarter same-store sales growth that beat expectations and raised its full-year earnings per share forecast to a range of $6.10-$6.20 per share, up from its prior expectations for earnings to come in at $5.95-$6.05 per share in its fiscal year. (Not all news is great: Shares of Walmart are up 3% compared to a year ago but lower than the S&amp;P 500, which is up 9.4%.)UBS analyst Michael Lasser, who has a Buy rating on shares of Walmart and a price target of $173, expects this week's meeting to have a ""bullish tone,"" no different than the commentary from the recent call with investors.If you plan on being in northwest Arkansas for the meeting and associated events this week, here's what to expect:Automation updates: Back in early April, at Walmart's investor meeting, the company said that by the end of fiscal year 2026, it aims to have 65% of its stores be serviced by the likes of AI digital assistants such as 'Ask Sam,' which is featured at its Sam's Club. That includes robots that scan inventory. It also aims to have approximately 55% of the fulfillment center volume move through automated facilities.Story continuesSeth Sigman, who has an Overweight rating and a $162 price target on shares said, ""The focus on productivity and automation... that's really more about building a muscle to create a more profitable business model to invest"" as the retailer looks to enhance its in-store shopping experience.An inside look at the market fulfillment center: As Walmart aims to take on Amazon (AMZN), the company will offer an inside look at its new fulfillment center located in Arkansas, which is attached to a store. This is Walmart's second-ever fulfillment center and its first in Arkansas (the first one was in Salem, New Hampshire), and Walmart plans to open more in select stores in the coming years.Fulfillment centers typically serve as a hub to get a product from a seller to the customer. These operations completely handle things like order pickup, package and delivery—unlike a distribution center which either sends the product to another location or directly to the consumer.The fulfillment center is intended to boost the customer experience ""through quicker, more accurate online order fulfillment,"" the company has said. These centers are expected to increase the number of orders a store can fulfill that day and decrease the number of times a product goes out of stock.The opportunity to see the new fulfillment center in action, ""will really bring a lot of this automation to life,"" Lasser said to Yahoo Finance.Walmart Opens First Market Fulfillment Center in Arkansas as the Retailer Doubles Down on Store Fulfillment (Courtesy: Walmart)Alternative businesses: Analysts are keeping score on how some recent major investments are performing like Walmart Connect, Walmart+, and Walmart Marketplace.Walmart Connect is the retailer's advertising business that is intended to serve advertisers an in-store, online, and omnichannel experience to accelerate growth for their company.Meanwhile, Walmart+ is a membership-based subscription model that costs $12.95 per month after a free 30-day trial. Perks include a Paramount+ subscription (PARA), free delivery from the store, free shipping with no order minimum, member savings on fuel, and return pickups from members' homes, among others.D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker said this is the ""big story"" for the retailer. He added: ""They've been investing in all these new businesses, these alternative businesses,"" and now are finally seeing returns.D.A. Davidson has a Buy rating on shares and a $178.07 price target.Culture wars? Thursday, June 1, kicks off Pride Month and one of Walmart's biggest competitors Target (TGT) and others including Kohl's (KSS) are facing boycotts over pride-themed merchandise. Will Walmart and its executives weigh in?Rock &amp; Roll: Some analysts — well, maybe most of them — are also looking forward to the all-day associate celebration on Friday, June 2, which typically features entertainment from A-List celebrities alongside messages from senior leadership. Previous celebrity guests included James Corden, Jennifer Garner, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Timberlake, and even Taylor Swift back in 2012.Any guesses on who it will be this year?—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Just as there is mounting pressure to make more money, there’s pressure to make what money you do earn stretch further. This means being extra scrupulous with how and where you spend your hard-earned paycheck — and likely hitting up dollar stores on the regular.Dollar Tree: 12 High-Quality Items To Buy in MayAlso: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchBecause dollar stores buy overstock and liquidated products and buy in mega-bulk (among other reasons), they can afford to sell items at rock-bottom prices. But are they really worth the hassle?After all, these bargain basements aren’t exactly known for their charming staff or organizational flair. How much more can you really save on a monthly basis by shopping at Dollar Tree than if you shopped solely at, say, Walmart or Amazon? It depends.Hundreds in Savings a Month“In order to determine how much money you can really save by shopping at the dollar store, you would have to calculate your average monthly spending and understand where your money is spent,” said Becky Brown, CEO and co-founder at ShoppingKim.com. “Specifically, you want to know how much money you spend on non-essential stuff.”Brown estimates that consumers spend roughly $300 to $700 monthly on stuff that can be purchased at the local dollar store — and they would save significantly if they made dollar stores their main destination.“Buying stuff for just a dollar would save you a decent amount of money, and I estimate it to be anywhere between $200 (and) $300 on average each month,” Brown said. “There are a lot of factors to consider, but I do believe this to be a fair estimate.”Dollar Tree vs. Walmart: A Toss-UpBut it depends on what you buy. The two main factors when determining a cheaper store are actual cost and what you get, said Paul Scarfone, a financial coach.Story continues“To illustrate this,” he said, “here is a brief sample of items that might appear on all of our lists: Salt, Cheerios, peanut butter, fruit snacks, oatmeal, rice and, of course, toilet paper. The cost of these seven items from Dollar Tree is a total of $8.75. If we instead went shopping at Walmart, this list would cost us $56.88.”Wow! Looks like we saved a heap by shopping at Dollar Tree instead of Walmart. But not so fast.“The truth is we spent less at Dollar Tree because their quantities are less,” Scarfone said. “We didn’t necessarily get a better deal. But, if the budget was $10 to go buy this list of items, we would not be able to shop at Walmart; we would have had to go to Dollar Tree.”The Key Is To Look at Unit PricesScarfone broke down the spending comparisons further: Instant oatmeal packets cost $1.25 at Dollar Tree — $0.21 per ounce. Instant oatmeal packets at Walmart cost $2.42 for 10 packets at 1.51 ounces each — $0.16 per ounce. This highlights the importance of examining unit prices to find the best deal.“Buying a larger quantity might be a better deal; but, if we end up wasting it, there are no savings,” Scarfone said.Michael Outar, owner of Savebly.com, provided examples of when Dollar Tree is the better deal, and when Walmart is the better deal, according to unit price:ItemDollar Tree PriceDollar Tree Price Per UnitWalmart PriceWalmart Price Per UnitCheaper OptionColgate Toothbrush$1.25$1.25 per toothbrush$1.00$1.00 per toothbrushWalmartDove Bar Soap$1.25 for 2.6-oz bar$0.48 per oz$1.27 for 3.17-oz bar$0.40 per ozWalmartBounty Essentials$1.25 for a 40-sheet roll$0.03 per sheet$8.99 for a 40-sheet roll$0.22 per sheetDollar TreePuffs Tissues$1.25 for a 96-tissue box$0.01 per tissue$4.50 for a 180-tissue box$0.03 per tissueDollar TreeGlad Sandwich Zipper Bags$1.25 for 29 bags$0.04 per bag$7.89 for 50 bags$0.15 per bagDollar TreeMixing Spoons$1.25 for 4 spoons$0.31 per spoon$0.97 for 4 spoons$0.24 per spoonWalmartLady Speed Stick Deodorant$1.25 for 1.4 oz$0.89 per oz$1.24 for 1.4 oz$0.88 per ozWalmartBuy These Items To SaveIf you’re in a rush, consider that some items are almost always cheaper/better value at the dollar store.“For instance, you’ll find modest savings on cleaning supplies — including around 30 cents for disinfecting wipes, $5 for toilet bowl cleaner, $3 on latex cleaning gloves and 54 cents on sponges,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. “Other products you can save on include around $5 on plastic sandwich bags, $1 on hand soap refills and around $3 on paper plates.“If you were to purchase all of these items on a monthly basis from dollar stores rather than a big-box store, you (would) save close to $18 a month, which can help you save over $200 a year,” Ramhold said.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Money You Can Save Each Month By Shopping at the Dollar Store]"

20,d8cbccfe-5971-3b62-a57a-eb4da66f2210,MMC,2023-05-31,Warren Buffett and Goldman Sachs Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 3 Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-goldman-sachs-one-205729263.html,1685480249,STORY,"['GS', 'OXY', 'CHTR', 'MMC']","[Some people’s exploits in their chosen profession transcend beyond the industry they operate in – making them household names. It’s pretty safe to claim that even those not interested in the investing world are familiar with Warren Buffett.Buffett embodies the term ‘legendary investor’ probably more than any other and considering his decades of almost unrivalled stock picking success, it’s a thoroughly deserved epithet.For those looking to emulate a fraction of Buffett’s success and get ahead of the game, it makes sense to see which stocks currently reside in the Oracle of Omaha’s portfolio. And when some of those equities also have the support of one of Wall Street’s leading banks, such as Goldman Sachs, it conveys an even stronger message that the time might be right for loading up.Against this backdrop, we delved into the TipRanks database to get the lowdown on three stocks that currently get the endorsement from both Buffett and the banking giant. Let’s check the details.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)For our first Buffett/Goldman-backed name, we’ll turn to the energy sector and the multinational firm Occidental Petroleum. The Houston, Texas-based company engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of oil and gas. Active since 1920, Occidental has become one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States. The company also operates globally, with significant activities not only in the US but also in the Middle East and Latin America.With its know-how and global reach, the company benefited immensely from rising energy prices last year, and like many names in one of the few sectors to thrive, OXY stock had a stellar 2022 – notching gains of 117%. But its performance has been more muted this year.Affected by reduced volumes and prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and domestic natural gas, in Q1, revenue fell by 14.9% year-over-year to $7.26 billion, missing the Street’s forecast by $110 million. Profits also dropped, with adj. EPS falling by 48% to $1.09, which came in shy of the $1.37 consensus estimate.Story continuesAlthough free cash flow fell by 33% in Q1 to $1.69 billion, that hasn’t halted the company’s stock buying activities. In the quarter, Oxy repurchased $752 million worth of stock, keeping it on track to meet its $3 billion repurchase program for 2023.Despite the underperformance, to say Buffett remains an OXY fan is a bit of an understatement. OXY shares make up a bug chunk of his portfolio, and during Q1, Buffett purchased an additional 17,355,469 shares. Notably, he continued to demonstrate his faith in May by purchasing approximately 5.62 million more shares. As it stands, Buffett’s ownership of around 217.3 million OXY shares translates to a staggering $12.73 billion, representing an impressive 24.4% stake in the company.Buffett’s unwavering faith in OXY is backed up by Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta, who shares a positive view on the company. Mehta, a 5-star analyst, points out a few key reasons why OXY looks promising, noting: “We remain positive on OXY due to its attractive FCF generation potential (13% FCF yield vs. 9% for diversified peers), which can drive robust share repurchase and allow the company to redeem its preferred equity and simplify its corporate structure (a focus for the company this year). Our favorable FCF outlook is underpinned by above-mid-cycle cash flows from chemicals, and we continue to expect favorable upstream results from OXY’s Permian operations.”These comments underpin Mehta’s Buy rating while his $77 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 31%. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an extra 7 Buys and Holds, each, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of 22%, considering the average target stands at $71.67. (See OXY stock forecast)Charter Communications (CHTR)Let’s now pivot from energy to a big player in the telecom industry. Charter Communications is one of the US’s largest telecommunications and mass media companies. In fact, by subscribers, it is the country’s second-largest cable operator. Charter provides a wide range of offerings including cable television, high-speed internet, and telephone services to residential and commercial customers. Operating under the brand name Spectrum, the company serves millions of customers across 41 states.In addition to its core services, Charter has also ventured into the streaming market with its video-on-demand platform, Spectrum TV, which offers a broad selection of movies and TV shows to subscribers.Despite missing expectations on the profit profile in last month’s 1Q23 report, investors seemingly preferred to focus on the positives. EPS of $6.65 missed consensus expectations of $7.50, but revenue grew by 3.4% year-over-year to $13.65 billion and surpassing the Street’s projection by $40 million. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.6% from the same period a year ago to reach $5.4 billion. In the quarter, the company also reported a record of 686,000 wireless net adds.As for Buffett’s involvement, he owns a chunk of CHTR stock. His total holdings of 3,828,941 shares are currently worth over $1.27 billion.The telecom giant also gets the support of Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman, who sees some shareholder pleasing moves ahead.“We remain confident that CHTR can achieve LSD EBITDA growth in 2023, with growth accelerating in 2H23 as opex comps ease… We continue to expect that CHTR will be able to sustain, and gradually ramp, its share repurchases over the next 5 years, even during periods of elevated capex, based on our outlook for sustained EBITDA growth, which should create additional borrowing capacity that we expect CHTR to use to fund buybacks. As such, we estimate that over the next 5 years CHTR will repurchase nearly $40bn of stock representing almost 60% of its market cap,” Feldman opined.Accordingly, Feldman rates CHTR shares a Buy rating along with a $450 price target. The implication for investors? Potential upside of 35% from current levels. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)The Goldman Sachs view represents the bulls here; the Street shows a definite split in the reviews for CHTR. Out of 16 recent analyst reviews, there are 7 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $469.65 average target, investors will be pocketing returns of 41% a year from now. (See CHTR stock forecast)Marsh &amp; Mclennan Companies (MMC)Now let’s shift gears once more to a globally recognized professional services company that has received endorsements from both Buffett and Goldman Sachs. Marsh &amp; McLennan is a prominent player in the field, specializing in risk management, insurance brokerage, and consulting services. The company operates through its four main subsidiaries: Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, and Oliver Wyman. With expertise spanning these diverse sectors, Marsh &amp; McLennan is well-positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to its clients on a global scale.Marsh provides insurance broking and risk management solutions to clients, helping them deal with complex risks while protecting their assets. Guy Carpenter focuses on reinsurance brokerage and strategic advisory services, assisting insurers in managing their reinsurance needs. Mercer specializes in human resources consulting, offering a wide range of services related to employee benefits, talent management, and retirement planning. Lastly, Oliver Wyman provides management consulting services, assisting clients in various industries with strategic planning, risk assessment, and operational improvement.Being in business for more than 150 years, MMC has established itself as a trusted global name, and this was evident in the company’s most recently reported quarter – for 1Q23. Boosted by a strong display from its risk and insurance services, revenue climbed by 6.3% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, edging ahead of the forecast by $40 million. Adj. EPS of $2.53 improved on the $2.30 generated in the same period a year ago whilst also coming in $0.06 above Street expectations. During the quarter, the company bought back 1.8 million shares of its stock for $300 million.Buffett enters the frame here via the 404,911 MMC shares he presently holds. At the current price, these are worth over $70.58 million.The global services firm also has a fan in Goldman analyst Robert Cox. Scanning the Q1 print, Cox finds plenty of reassuring points to keep him on board.“We view MMC 1Q23 results as further evidence that the company is taking advantage of strong P&amp;C broking conditions, talent investments are producing results, and margins are set to continue expanding materially with further expense efficiencies identified,” the analyst explained. “The broad based RIS organic growth beat in the quarter combined with our expectations for modestly decelerating P&amp;C pricing and exposure growth leads us to raise our FY23 RIS organic growth estimate by 50bps to +9.7% (+7.1% excluding fiduciary investment income).”Putting these thoughts into grades and numbers, Cox rates MMC shares a Buy, backed by a $202 price target. Should the figure be met, investors are looking at upside of 16% from current levels. (To watch Cox’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, 3 analysts join Cox in the bull camp and with an additional 6 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $189.80, the average target implies shares have room for ~9% growth over the coming months.

In connection with the Company’s planned participation in the upcoming Nareit REITweek Conference, the Company has also posted a new Investor Update to its website, www.equityapartments.com.""We are pleased to raise our outlook for full year same store revenue, NOI and Normalized FFO per share. This increase reflects continued strong demand across our markets, particularly New York, and lower than previously anticipated delinquency in Southern California.

The Company, a member of the S&amp;P 500, is focused on the acquisition, development and management of residential properties located in and around dynamic cities that attract affluent long-term renters. Equity Residential owns or has investments in 303 properties consisting of 79,900 apartment units, with an established presence in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, and an expanding presence in Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin. For more information on Equity Residential, please visit our website at www.equityapartments.com.Story continuesForward-Looking StatementsIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements and information within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. While Equity Residential’s management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, including, without limitation, changes in general market conditions, including the rate of job growth and cost of labor and construction material, the level of new multifamily construction and development, government regulations (such as eviction moratoriums) and competition. These and other risks and uncertainties are described under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available on our website, www.equityapartments.com. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond management’s control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. Equity Residential assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events.Terms and Definitions:Earnings Per Share (""EPS"") – Net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS.FFO and Normalized FFO:Funds From Operations (""FFO"") – The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""Nareit"") defines FFO (December 2018 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a REIT, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. Adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Expected FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.Normalized Funds From Operations (""Normalized FFO"") – Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes:the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating real estate asset impairment;pursuit cost write-offs;gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions;gains and losses from non-operating assets; andother miscellaneous items.Expected Normalized FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual Normalized FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.The Company believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results.FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the ""Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership"". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.The following table presents a reconciliation of expected EPS to expected FFO per share and expected Normalized FFO per share.Expected2023Per ShareEPS – Diluted$2.02 to $2.12Depreciation expense2.17Net (gain) loss on sales(0.50)Impairment – operating real estate assets—FFO per share – Diluted3.69 to 3.79Impairment – non-operating real estate assets—Write-off of pursuit costs0.01Debt extinguishment and preferred shareredemption (gains) losses—Non-operating asset (gains) losses0.01Other miscellaneous items0.02Normalized FFO per share – Diluted$3.73 to $3.83Net Operating Income (""NOI"") – NOI is the Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment properties. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment properties. NOI does not include an allocation of property management expenses either in the current or comparable periods. Rental income for all leases and operating expense for ground leases (for both same store and non-same store properties) are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods.Non-Residential – Consists of revenues and expenses from retail and public parking garage operations.Non-Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired during 2022 and 2023, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2022.Physical Occupancy – The weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period divided by the average of total apartment units available for rent for the reporting period.Residential – Consists of multifamily apartment revenues and expenses.Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired or completed that are stabilized prior to January 1, 2022, less properties subsequently sold. Properties are included in Same Store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230530005640/en/ContactsMarty McKenna(312) 928-1901mmckenna@eqr.com]"

""COVID has done a lot of structural damage to the Chinese economy.""The yuan dropped to its lowest since last November, when China was under public health restrictions. It was last down 0.5% at 7.124 per dollar, putting it on track for a 2.6% drop this month, following a series of weak readings on anything from industrial profits, to retail sales and loan growth.The disappointment filtered through to other China-sensitive assets. The Australian dollar hit a near seven-month low of $0.6489 and is down four months in a row, while crude oil and copper sank.In Europe, equities came under a third day of selling pressure. The regional STOXX 600 hit two-month lows, led by declines in China-focussed luxury stocks like LVMH , Burberry and Swatch Group.Story continuesDOLLAR ON A ROLLThe dollar, which was up 0.4% against a basket of currencies, is set for its largest monthly rise since September, thanks to safe-haven flows stemming from concerns around the gridlock over the U.S. debt ceiling.The euro tumbled by as much as 0.7% on the day after data showed a rapid cooling in consumer price pressures in both France and Germany - the region's two largest economies.The data didn't do much to move the needle on interest rate expectations, though. Money markets on Wednesday showed traders expect the European Central Bank to raise rates to a peak of around 3.70% by September, from 3.25% now, showing almost no change from Tuesday's close.A separate report on Tuesday showed consumer and producer price expectations have dropped sharply, but remain high by historical standards, according to Matt Simpson, a strategist at City Index.""If prices are expected to stay high, they probably will,"" he said.Meanwhile, Treasury yields fell after a deal to suspend the U.S. debt limit and avoid a default cleared a House of Representatives committee overnight. The bill is set for debate on Wednesday, and passage would send it to the Senate where debate could stretch to the weekend.Treasuries rallied after the initial deal was struck, on the expectation a U.S. default would be averted, but the market remains skittish as once it is authorised to borrow the Treasury is likely to issue lots of debt to replenish its coffers.Benchmark 10-year yields, which have dropped by 17 basis points (bps) in the last two days, were last at 3.65%, their lowest since May 19. Two-year yields fell 5 bps to 4.428%.In commodity markets, copper headed for a second monthly drop after the Chinese data, and was last trading down 0.8% on the day at $8,062 a tonne, while Brent crude, which has lost 10% this month, was down 2.4% at $71.76 a barrel.(Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill, Kirsten Donovan)]"

[O/R]West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude is expected to average $79.20 a barrel in 2023, down from the previous month's $82.23 consensus.Worries around robust monetary tightening, bank failures in the U.S., the risk of a U.S. debt default and China's uneven economic performance have limited the market's upside even though it falls into deficit in the second half of the year, Matthew Sherwood, lead commodities analyst at EIU, said.But possible further production cuts from OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and other allies, at its June 4 meeting in Vienna, could provide a floor for prices, some analysts said.""Given the macro uncertainties and fall in oil prices in May, we think OPEC would want to adjust production targets down further, but may have to risk ceding market share to Russia,"" Suvro Sarkar, energy sector team lead at DBS Bank, said.Given conflicting messages on the next oil policy moves from OPEC+, poll respondents were divided on whether the group would push ahead with more output cuts this weekend, or leave production targets unchanged to assess the impact of earlier cuts.""Even if OPEC+ does not cut in June, the threat of production cuts will remain as long as oil remains significantly below $80 per barrel,"" EIU'S Sherwood said.OPEC+ surprised the market in April with output cuts that briefly drove up oil prices.(Reporting by Kavya Guduru in Bengaluru; Editing by Noah Browning and Barbara Lewis)]"

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley said, the bank “looks forward to establishing a futures company in China as we grow our domestic business footprint.”Thus, Morgan Stanley becomes the second foreign bank to wholly own a futures business in the world’s second-largest economy.The first foreign bank to fully own a futures company in China is JPMorgan JPM. In June 2020, JPM received approval to increase its stake in its futures joint venture (JV) — J.P.Morgan Futures Co. — from 49% to 100%.Our TakeMorgan Stanley has a presence in China since 1994. With offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and a regional office in Hong Kong, the company offers a wide array of services to domestic and international clients, including financing, restructuring, M&amp;A advisory, research, fixed income and foreign exchange.Given that China’s financial market is open to foreign firms following the removal of ownership restrictions in 2018, several global banks have capitalized on the lucrative prospect.While China continues to be the second-largest equity market globally, and is one of the broadest and deepest growth markets outside the United States, its business climate has deteriorated significantly and because of the increasing restrictions in the region, the private sector has been negatively impacted. Deal-making has also been curbed, hampering investment banking (“IB”) business growth. Thus, MS is scaling back its expansion plans in the country.Morgan Stanley has been considering cutting around 7% of jobs in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan). This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts the company announced earlier.Of the total cuts, China is likely to take the biggest hit because of the slowing economic growth in the country.  Last year, MS slashed roughly 50 IB jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with a large number being China-focused positions.Over the past six months, shares of Morgan Stanley have lost 9.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 17.4%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Like MS, other Wall Street giants, including The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

With that, let me hand it over to Aaron.Story continuesAaron LevieThank you, Cynthia, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased to deliver first quarter operating results above our guidance. This includes revenue growth of 6% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. In addition to a strong focus on profitability, resulting in operating margin of 23%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. Achieving these results in a challenging macro environment is a testament to the value of our Content Cloud platform and the operational discipline of our Boxers as we deliver substantial year-over-year bottom line improvements. While the dynamic macro economy continues to pressure IT spend and headcount growth expectations from our customers, trends we've seen continue to play out most notably in EMEA and smaller businesses in the U.S. We are also seeing strong traction and stickiness of our platform and customers, and our message is well aligned to the challenges they're facing today. Over the last quarter, I've had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of business and technology leaders, and it's clear that the dynamics enterprises face today are fully aligned with the pillars that underpin our strategy. Enterprises are focused on simplifying their IT environment, driving productivity across their businesses and protecting their most sensitive data. And across nearly all of my conversations in the last quarter, business leaders everywhere are looking to leverage the power of AI to help transform how they work and get even more value out of their data. Box's Content Cloud platform is best positioned to help these customers solve these challenges. And our Q1 customer wins illustrate how we will remain mission-critical for them. These wins include a global manufacturing company that collaborates with defense and federal government agencies, who is a new customer who purchased Box in Q1 in order to meet FedRAMP and ITAR compliance for content management. Also realizing the value to streamline its tech stack and integrate Box with its sales force instance to power the underlying compliant content layer for their customer portal. A multinational retailer expanded its use of Box with a 6-figure ramped enterprise license agreement and purchase of Box Shield to protect the vast amount of personal identifiable information that is stored inside a Box. And critical to our success is our continued execution of our product road map, which expands our TAM and adds value to our core platform with new product innovation. In Q1, we were pleased to announce the general availability of Box Canvas, which delivers a powerful new way for teams to unleash their creativity to take brainstorming and ideation to a new level while leveraging the enterprise-grade security, compliance and workflow automation capabilities of Box. Box customers now have access to unlimited Canvas' included in their plans, which enables us to disruptively enter this market, and we're already seeing amazing use cases emerge across our customers. Since we launched Box Sign, Box customers are taking advantage of unlimited e-signatures included in their plans, and have migrated use cases over from costly incumbents. In Q1, we released advanced e-signature features such as a dedicated Box Sign policy for Box Shield to provide users with the ability to seamlessly request signatures on documents, subject to Box Shield access policies. We also launched a Box Sign relay integration that specifically enables post-signature actions to be orchestrated and enables our customers to build end-to-end e-signature workflows in the Content Cloud. We also announced the next generation of Box's content migration solution, Box Shuttle, now built directly into the Box Admin Console. With Box Shuttle, content migration is a simple, accessible process and that organizations of all sizes can take full advantage of the many features and capabilities that the Content Cloud has to offer. Finally, an integral part of the product strategy is our ability to integrate deeply across the SaaS landscape, including with products like Microsoft Teams and Office, WebEx, Zoom, Google Workspace, ServiceNow, ITSM's technology solutions and much more. In Q1, in addition to delivering integration enhancements with Slack and Salesforce, we were pleased to announce a number of new technology partners that extend the value of Box including Notion, Sona, [NowerBites] and Cloudflare. As we look forward into FY '24 and beyond, our pace of innovation continues to accelerate. We are at the beginning stages of a new era of software. Similar to how cloud and mobile changed the technology landscape forever, AI has the opportunity to completely change how work is done. As highlighted by the meteoric rise of ChatGPT, we've recently begun to see a huge breakthrough in the potential of large language models or LLMs, which are now capable of bringing human level reasoning to a large number of tasks. However, the real power of these new AI models is when you use their intelligence to help you work securely with your own proprietary data set. For years, we've been able to ask questions about our structured data like the information that's in a database ERP system or CRM system. You can ask those systems for financial forecasts, sales pipeline results, inventory levels, supply chain details and more. But we had limited ability to ask questions of our unstructured data like content which is 80% of corporate data. And now we can, by safely bringing leading AI models to enterprise data. Enterprises can truly unlock the value that lies in their content. To do this, we need a way to connect these models safely, securely and compliantly to our enterprise content. As we announced just earlier this month, with Box AI, we're taking the power of the world's leading AI models starting initially with OpenAIs ChatGPT 3.5 and GPT4 and securely letting customers leverage them for their enterprise content. With Box AI, customers can ask questions of their content or generate new information leveraging Box Notes. Imagine being able to instantly ask things like how many days of parental leave can I take on an HR document or please summarize this report and provide 5 key takeaways on a quarterly earnings document or how would you pitch this product to a customer in the automotive industry when looking at a product overview document. But this is just the beginning. Ultimately, as a core platform capability, Box AI will be used throughout the product to continue to transform how we work with our content in a variety of ways. We can imagine in the future being able to use AI to automatically classify content in even more specific ways, automatically extract data using a relay workflow, platform APIs to interact with AI models from a variety of providers and being able to ask questions of a larger set of documents on a specific topic. And as a platform-neutral vendor, we will also be AI neutral, which means as new AI breakthroughs emerge for more vendors over time, we'll be in a position to bring the full power of their technology to Box and our customers. In addition to our collaboration with OpenAI, we recently announced that we are building on our strategic partnership with Google Cloud to integrate Google's advanced AI models into Box AI to create new ways for joint customers to work smarter and more productively with generative AI. Like any new technology era, our approach with Box AI is to execute on this opportunity with a high degree of thoughtfulness. Initial customer access will be granted through a design partner program and we are excited to keep you updated as we continue to innovate with Box AI to capitalize on the exciting new product opportunities this technology shift has created. Now turning to go-to-market. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in March, our optimized pricing and packaging initiatives have allowed us to see a greater total account value, higher net retention, higher gross margins and a more efficient sales process. Our strategy is to continue launching new multiproduct offerings over time, increasing the value to our customers by bringing them the full power of the Content Cloud. Our latest multiproduct offering, Enterprise Plus continues to be well over 90% of our suite sales in large deals, with suites comprising 69% of deals over $100,000 in Q1. We saw consistent suite attach rates in large deals across all of our geographies. Our Q1 customer expansions and new wins with Enterprise Plus include a U.S. company that develops and produces building materials and services expanded its use of Box with a 6-figure renewal and purchase of Enterprise Plus to gain the benefits of Shield and Box Governance. As more and more data is migrated into Box from old SharePoint sites and file servers, it was necessary for the company to implement the advanced security and compliance controls that Enterprise Plus provides. A leading U.S. hospital system and research institute expanded its use of Box in Q1 with an upgrade to Enterprise Plus in order to enable Box Sign for their clinical trials. Box' security posture is also a critical component to their technology ecosystem. In summary, our ability to deliver first quarter results above our guidance is a direct result of the compelling value of our Content Cloud platform and the execution we have been driving as a company. And with our latest Box AI efforts, we're building a powerful, platform-neutral approach for companies to securely bring AI to their content and transform how they work. I'm proud of the work that our Boxers do globally and at Box, our employees are critical to our ability to serve our customers successfully and innovate rapidly. In addition to being named #2 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor last quarter, Box was recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as #27 in the 100 best companies to work for in 2023. Finally, along with continuing to build out a strong culture, we remain steadfastly committed to driving a continued balance of growth and increased profitability in this very dynamic market while investing in growth drivers for the future, like Box AI. While currency headwinds and the IT spend environment are putting pressure on our top line results for this year, we continue to drive improved bottom line results through a culture of operational excellence and focused discipline on our spending while doubling down on new product development that will lead us to increasing long-term revenue growth. And with that, let me hand it off to Dylan.Dylan SmithThanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q1 was another strong quarter for Box with revenue, EPS and operating margin results all above the high end of guidance despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. We continued investing in profitable growth while optimizing our underlying cost structure, resulting in a resilient long-term financial model. Our balanced business model allows us to invest in innovative new products such as Box Canvas and Box AI generate continued gross margin and operating leverage and consistently return capital to our shareholders. In Q1, we delivered revenue of $252 million, up 6% year-over-year, above the high end of our guidance and representing 10% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. We now have nearly 1,680 total customers paying more than $100,000 annually, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our suites attach rate of 69% in large Q1 deals demonstrates the value our Content Cloud platform is delivering to our large customers. 47% of our revenue is now attributable to suites customers, a significant 10-point increase from 37% a year ago. Even in this dynamic environment, Box's value proposition is resonating with customers as they look to Box to transform, simplify and secure their IT environment. We ended Q1 with remaining performance obligations, or RPO, of $1.2 billion, a 17% year-over-year increase or 19% growth on a constant currency basis. This strong growth was driven by continued lengthening in customer contract durations as well as an uptick in the volume of early renewals in recent quarters as customers look to more quickly adopt the full value of our suites offerings. We expect to recognize roughly 60% of our RPO over the next 12 months. Q1 billings of $192 million grew 11% year-over-year, ahead of our guidance of a mid-single-digit growth rate and representing 15% growth in constant currency. Our strong billings outcome in Q1 was due in large part to a high volume of early renewals, pulling forward billings of roughly $6 million that had been scheduled to renew later in the year. Our net retention rate at the end of Q1 was 106%, in line with our expectations. Our annualized full churn rate was 3% versus 4% in the prior year, demonstrating the criticality and stickiness of our product offerings even in the current environment. We expect full churn to remain at roughly 3% throughout this year. For the remainder of FY '24, we expect our net retention rate to stabilize in the range of 104% to 105% as we manage through the macroeconomic environment, resulting in lower seat expansion rates, particularly in our U.S. commercial and EMEA customers. Gross margin came in at 77.9% in Q1, up 160 basis points from 76.3% a year ago and well above the 76% range we had expected for the first half of this year. Our Q1 gross margin reflects the optimizations we're delivering as we execute on our public cloud migration strategy. We expect our duplicative public cloud and data center expenses to peak in Q2 leading to our gross margin expectations in the 76% range for Q2. As we look to the second half of the year, we fully expect gross margins to rebound to the high 70s. Q1 gross profit of $196 million was up 8% year-over-year, exceeding our revenue growth rate by 200 basis points. We once again delivered leverage across the entire business in Q1 with a 17% increase in operating income to $57 million. Our 22.8% operating margin was up 220 basis points from the 20.6% delivered a year ago. We delivered diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 in Q1, up 39% from $0.23 a year ago and a full $0.05 above the high end of our guidance which includes an impact of negative $0.05 from FX. I would also note that Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter in which we delivered GAAP profitability. I'll now turn to our cash flow and balance sheet. In Q1, we generated free cash flow of $108 million, a 19% increase from $91 million in the year ago period. We delivered cash flow from operations of $125 million, a 16% increase from $108 million in the year ago period. Capital lease payments, which we included in our free cash flow calculation, were $10 million, down from $12 million in Q1 of last year. Let's now turn to our capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter with $518 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. In Q1, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $44 million. As of April 30, 2023, we had approximately $97 million of remaining buyback capacity under our current share repurchase plan. We remain very committed to returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases, and we expect to actively repurchase additional shares in Q2. With that, I would like to turn to our guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2024. The U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, resulting in a larger-than-expected FX headwind for Q2 and the second half of the year versus our initial FY '24 guidance. As a reminder, approximately 1/3 of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S., primarily in Japanese yen. The following guidance includes the expected impact of FX headwinds, assuming current exchange rates. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we anticipate revenue in the range of $260 million to $262 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth at the high end of this range or 11% in constant currency. We expect our Q2 billings growth rate in the low single-digit range on an as-reported basis reflecting an expected 100 basis point headwind from FX as well as the impact of the early renewals that contributed to our exceptionally strong Q1 billings results. We once again expect our Q2 RPO growth to be higher than our anticipated Q2 revenue growth rate. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin to increase to approximately 24%, representing a 230 basis point improvement year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.35, representing a 25% year-over-year increase at the high end of the range and GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.01 to $0.02. Weighted average diluted shares are expected to be approximately $150 million, flat with Q1. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected headwind from FX of approximately $0.05, primarily due to fluctuations in the yen as discussed previously for the full fiscal year ending January 31, 2024. We now expect FY '24 revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion representing 6% year-over-year growth or 10% on a constant currency basis. This revised range reflects both the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen and the IT spending environment we discussed earlier. We now expect FX to have a negative 350 basis point impact to our FY '24 revenue growth rate versus our prior expectation of 300 basis points. We expect FY '24 gross margin to be roughly 77.5%, 50 basis points above our previous expectations. As we continue to execute on our important transition to the public cloud and unlock additional leverage in our model, we will be exiting FY '24 with an even stronger gross margin profile. As a result, we are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance by 50 basis points to approximately 25.5% representing a 240 basis point improvement from last year's results of 23.1%. We are also raising our FY '24 non-GAAP EPS expectations to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.50 representing a 25% increase at the high end of the range versus $1.20 in the prior year, and we expect FY '24 GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.23. Weighted average diluted shares are expected to be approximately $151 million. Our FY '24 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance includes an expected annual impact from FX of approximately $0.20. For the full year of FY '24, we now anticipate currency headwinds to impact our billings growth rate by a little more than 100 basis points. We expect our FY '24 billings growth rate to be in the mid-single digit range on an as-reported basis. In summary, we are pleased with our execution in Q1. We once again demonstrated our disciplined and balanced model of investing for long-term growth while expanding both operating and free cash flow margins. We remain committed to achieving our FY '24 revenue growth plus free cash flow margin target of 35% or 39% in constant currency. In this dynamic macroeconomic environment, the Box Content Cloud is the platform that enterprises need to transform their business while lowering their costs. With that, Aaron and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question today comes from the line of Steve Enders with Citi.Steven Lester EndersI guess I just want to ask a little more on just the macroeconomic and what you're seeing out there? And I guess, what specifically is it in the EMEA and SMB business (inaudible) being impacted here. And I guess maybe how has that changed versus what we're seeing in the (inaudible) part of a couple of quarters?Aaron LevieYes. This is Aaron. I'll take that. I think overall, the general trends were pretty similar to kind of Q4 and what we were already seeing at the tail end of Q3 of last year. We did want to call out kind of an incremental element of softness on the SMB front in the U.S. and what we're seeing in EMEA. But as you can kind of see in the general guidance as well as because of the FX impact, it really is just incremental, but we did want to kind of note that. Overall, I think as we've kind of talked about in the past couple of quarters, the general dynamic is you just sort of see that there's more scrutiny on larger deals, especially in those segments of the business where maybe previously, we'd be doing a $100,000 deal, and that would be in this today's environment, maybe fewer seats would be transacted and that would come under that level as an example. But overall, I think when you look at the kind of Q1 results, Q2 guide, I think we're seeing some healthy trends across the business, but we did want to just call it that incremental softness.Steven Lester EndersOkay. That's helpful there. And I think anyone asks on the AI side and (inaudible) announcements that you've -- you come out with already, but I guess, how should we think about the potential for monetization and maybe how you're thinking about funding and kind of going forward? I guess what's kind of the early read on how you're thinking about that aspect of the AI strategy?Aaron LevieYes. So I do want to note, obviously, it's still pretty early in our overall journey with the latest wave of our Box AI efforts. Obviously, we've been in the space for a while and deeply understand the kind of potential in the use cases. But with -- what we're seeing with large language models as a pretty new frontier of use cases that we are unbelievably excited about, we want to make sure that we drive the right kind of product UX, the right kind of pricing and packaging, which is why we are taking a kind of measured approach as we roll this out. I think philosophically, the way that we think about it internally from a product and company standpoint is there are some use cases that we believe are just going to be kind of fundamentally table stakes for a product like ours. Some of those table stakes might be generating content with AI. Some of them might be asking questions of some amount of data leveraging AI. And in those cases, we want to try and ensure that we can broadly make that set of capabilities available. That's philosophical obviously, as we go through our design partner program and beta programs, we'll continue to evolve that. And then there are some maybe more either advanced capabilities or capabilities that have a high consumption dynamic related to them often through our platform or maybe in workflows where we will want to have incremental monetization via either our kind of platform API business or through our multiproduct suite packaging and that will be really driven by some of the use cases that we see from customers, again, especially through this design partner program. So I'd say kind of in the coming quarter or 2, stay tuned as we continue to evolve the ultimate pricing and packaging decisions, I think you've seen pretty similar dynamics in other -- either peer companies or big tech companies as they roll out beta programs of their products, trying to figure out what's the right kind of pricing model. We're basically doing the same. But I think the thing that we're -- we've already shown and done are very kind of public about now is we are going to be building this technology full force, and we think it's transformational in how we can work with our unstructured data and our content.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley.Joshua Phillip BaerCongrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask a few on use cases for Box, whether it's positioning for AI or cost cutting in this environment. Are there any use cases for Box that are really resonating around some of these themes today? And then separately or related, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix of your customers that are using Box to collaborate in some way externally, like the external use case with partners or suppliers or customers or clients?Aaron LevieYes. So maybe just in reverse order, I'd say the significant percentage of our -- especially our larger deals, so that make up increasingly the bulk of our revenue. There's a heavy degree of internal and external collaboration going on with our product. It's one of our key value propositions is our defense kind of -- you're in the defense industry, you need to collaborate with the government or other kinds of manufacturing partners. You need something that is both going to be compliant for, FedRAMP, let's say, and have advanced security controls and allow you to kind of move data in and outside the boundaries of your organization in a very secure, compliant, reliable way.So whether it's financial services, life sciences, health care, defense, the tech industry, external collaboration is certainly kind of a core part of our overall value proposition. In terms of some of the near-term deals, it's pretty broad-based in terms of the industries that we're seeing business in across everything from life sciences and health care, great deals in the retail sector, even in tech, seeing some healthy deals as well. And I think the use cases are really kind of centered around our 3 core pillars of improving the security posture of the organization by protecting their most important data, helping drive better collaboration and workflows around content and then our platform, which connects to all of their software. So really being a hub for content that connects into ServiceNow and Slack and Salesforce and Microsoft Teams Office and many more applications. So I think those 3 kind of core areas of focus remain extremely alive and well. And then our conversations, which I wouldn't necessarily attribute any major kind of deals in Q1 tied to this, but the conversations have increasingly been about what is the AI strategy of any given customer and enterprise it's driving certainly a lot of conversations we're now having about Box AI. I've had more CIOs and even CEOs in some cases, reach out around our strategy in AI than we've seen kind of in prior technology trends. And I think everybody is trying to figure out their strategy of how do they bring generative AI to their enterprise use cases, which is going to -- which requires a substantial amount of work in kind of the abstraction layer between AI models, customer data and cloud infrastructure, and that's exactly what we're building out. So we think we're in a really strong position to help customers with that.Joshua Phillip BaerIf I could sneak one in for Dylan. Just wondering on the $6 million in early renewals, if you could provide some more color on what type of customers? What's driving that behavior? And then I guess, in regard to Q2 billings guidance, does that assume that the early renewal trend stops?Dylan SmithYes. So in terms of what's driving those early renewals, tends to be a handful of larger customers, and the main dynamic that would cause a customer and similarly in Q1, what we saw to decide to renew early is typically to move into suites and be able to support some of the higher-value newer use cases that they want to get into rather than, for example, waiting for the natural renewal cycle the following quarter to be in to adopt suites and those capabilities. So that tends to be what we see is just the clear buy-in and understanding the value proposition from customers and just wanted to move more quickly to take those on. And the most of that $6 million did come out of Q2, and we always tend to take a fairly conservative approach kind of the baseline of early renewals that we see, and that's baked into our kind of billings expectations in any given quarter. So we're not necessarily expecting to see the same type of volume that we saw in Q1, but we would expect to see some customers elect to early renew in the second quarter as we tend to see maybe in the quarter.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Pinjalim Bora with JPMorgan.Pinjalim BoraCongrats on the quarter. Aaron, on AI, I understand you can't really talk about the monetization at this point. But as you're talking to your customers, what are you hearing from them in terms of uptake of these AI functionalities. And do you overall see kind of area as an accelerant to the growth rate maybe in the medium term?Aaron LevieYes. So with conversations with customers, I would say that this is certainly probably the fastest amount of concerted energy that I've probably seen in the decade and half of doing Box on 1 single topic from an IT standpoint. So cloud computing, I mean we worked for 5 years at least, really just doing the very basics of educating enterprises on why the cloud was useful and what efficiency they could get from the cloud. And then it was still another decade until you had the kind of mainstream adoption of cloud across the enterprise base. With AI, I think you have such a rapid alignment of customers on testing new use cases, trying out new products and capabilities. Obviously, things like ChatGPT have been front and center. Some companies are fully banning that. Some customers are -- some companies are enabling that. And what I think companies are trying to figure out is where is the productivity gain going to most come from? Is it going to come from going into an AI interface and just like a ChatGPT and asking a question and getting an answer back? Or is it going to come from AI reasoning over existing data and existing workflows in an enterprise and then becoming a productivity boost for those kinds of use cases. With Box AI, actually, we're going to help customers do both because with Box Notes, you'll be able to generate content instantaneously directly from the AI model and with Box Preview and with future products that we haven't announced yet, you'll be able to start to ask questions of the existing data you have. And so we think we can meet both of those use cases but it's incredibly early for customers overall. I'll give you just a kind of a sense of the types of conversations we're having where companies are saying, ""Hey, I have hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of documents of a specific topic, could be contracts, could be life sciences research data, could be very kind of bespoke content types in a specific industry."" And they're saying, we have all this content. We want to be able to understand what's in it. We want to correlate trends across it. We want to ask questions of this data set. And right now, we have to have kind of humans manually go through this content to understand what's inside of it and apply metadata and to be able to actually kind of reason through it. And so they often don't get to the actual use cases that are super exciting because they just don't have enough either humans or it would be too costly. And so they never get around to it. And so with AI, it starts to actually unlock and -- kind of tap into all of this value of the underlying data that they already have inside of Box or if they move more data into box, it can certainly provide even more value. And so those are the kind of conversations that we're having with customers. We have some companies that are saying, ""Hey, we think we can identify new life sciences breakthroughs if we could correlate research across multiple research documents or we have a company in the advertising industry that believes that they could generate more revenue if they could quickly identify what projects to put certain advertisers on that wouldn't be known by any single individual inside their organization, it would only work if they actually collected all of the data across their organization to understand what kind of projects would make sense for certain advertisers. And so these are the really exciting kind of use cases which can drive productivity. They can drive new revenue opportunities for our customers. And so that's where we're certainly going to be pretty focused on. In terms of accelerating our revenue, I think because of how early it is, we want to be really thoughtful about that dynamic. I think to some extent, AI is going to become table stakes for all of modern software. And so we think it's going to be a huge driver of companies trying to get their data and their content into a really good logical architecture, the one that is secure, the one that's compliant, one that's in the cloud. we think we'll stand to benefit from that certainly and kind of the moving off of legacy fragmented systems. But at the same time, we recognize that companies in general will have a fixed amount of net new budget that they can bring to AI. And so there's going to be a lot of kind of volume for that budget. And so we want to be thoughtful about leaning too hard on that.Pinjalim BoraGot it. Very, very helpful. And one for Dylan. Dylan maybe the macro situation, the softness in the SMB and the EMEA. Maybe talk about the linearity of the quarter? How did that kind of fall through the 3 months in the quarter? Was it to (inaudible) towards the beginning. And also, if you can touch upon kind of the sequential revenue decline. Is that largely because of Box Consulting?Dylan SmithSure. So starting with the linearity. We saw a pretty normal linearity in the first quarter both in those segments you mentioned as well as the rest of the business, like our enterprise segments. So nothing unusual from that standpoint. And then in terms of the sequential revenue decline, that was primarily driven by the number of days that we had that there are in Q1 versus Q4, which has about a $9 million impact to the quarter's revenue versus Q4. And then there was also a couple of million dollars from a very strong Box Consulting revenue outcome in the fourth quarter. So those combined add up to about $11 million. And then the first of those, the todays dynamic, that's something that is not unique to this year, but usually doesn't show up in as pronounced of a way as we typically have a stronger and higher volume of bookings in the fourth quarter to offset that. But that was the main driver of the sequential chain of revenue.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. .Jason Noah AderAaron, I wanted to continue down the AI thread shockingly. First, I guess, I just wanted to -- let's look at it in 2 different ways. First, at a very high level, what does this mean for knowledge worker seats? And do you worry about that? Secondly, just on more on the kind of devil's advocate side, how does this -- how does the Microsoft competitive risk change or not, just because Microsoft has been at the forefront of a lot of this stuff? And then more on the kind of positive side, when you talk about monetization, I don't want to go there, but how are you using this internally maybe to improve your cost structure and what are some of your thoughts there? Dylan, you can chime in there as well. I'm sure you've thought a lot about that.Aaron LevieYes, great. We'll try and cover those. So on the first one, and just so I clarify, that was sort of like a meta kind of philosophical question on seat changes over time.Jason Noah AderYes, just a pool of knowledge workers potentially not growing as fast as it would have otherwise.Aaron LevieYes. I'm -- this is a personal opinion. And even from a corporate financial standpoint, we're so early in our kind of total seat population that this would be a corporate view as well in terms of what the potential is for Box overall. But I strongly believe that this is going to be a net positive impact to just knowledge worker productivity as opposed to a net replacement to kind of large swaps of knowledge work. If you look at the actual tasks that any one of us do in any of our jobs kind of across our roughly 2,500 employees or kind of anybody that we interact with, the vast majority of work that we're actually doing is sort of a collection of many subtasks; hundreds, thousands of subtasks that require us to have a large degree of context that we kind of maintain. And I think AI is going after those individual subtasks and in some cases, collections of subtasks, but really in a way that will just make us more productive overall. Maybe some roles will be 5% more productive, some roles may be 50% more productive. But I think the net result of that is that we just accelerate into the future faster as opposed to we kind of like do less work or that a company wouldn't want to grow faster if they could with AI and making their employees more productive. So in general, I think whether it's -- we'll produce more graphic designers and there'll be more engineers and our sales reps will be more efficient in working with customers. I see there's only a sign that we'll be able to either over time, globally, more people will be able to do those jobs and there'll be more demand for those skills overall because companies can then be more efficient. Instead of having maybe a sales rep or an engineer waste time trying to search or find information, they can be doing the more fun productive parts of their job of working with a customer or getting code released and building a feature. And so I think that's the kind of impact on the total knowledge worker population. So I'm firmly in the optimist camp on this one in terms of what it does to jobs. On Microsoft, so 2 things to note. One, we're partnering with OpenAI which by virtue leads you to partnering more broadly over time with Microsoft as well, given the OpenAI models generally running on Azure. So there's, I think, a lot of exciting potential on that collaboration and an area that we're going to cooperate with them, we think, pretty meaningfully. And so customers will be able to basically leverage the exact same AI that they would be seeing in any Microsoft products, but within Box as well. So that kind of adds a bit of a bit of benefit to our relationship there with CoPilot. CoPilot already has the ability to drive integrations with third-party software. And so Box was kind of announced at a high level last week at the Build conference as one of those integrations. And so we're going to deeply integrate across CoPilot in the various API endpoints that they create. So you'll see a lot of interoperability where maybe you go to CoPilot and you ask a question that needs to pull data from Box and Atlassian or Box Inc salesforce or any of the supported products. And so we think that will kind of be a very clear way that we can integrate. And overall, strategically, I think what you're going to see us do is go deeper specifically in content than what we believe any other player is going to be building out from an AI standpoint. And so understanding the content AI use cases is core to our value proposition and our expertise. And then I think the secondary element is our neutrality ends up being a huge benefit for customers. So today, obviously, OpenAI has many of the leading models. We announced a partnership with Google, where we'll certainly be working with Google technology. There's other great players in the market like and others. Our ability to be neutral to some of those kind of battles, we think, put us in a very strong position as well where customers can leverage wherever the various breakthroughs are coming from. And then in terms of cost structure, I'll let Dylan talk about it. But in general, we want to certainly ensure our employees are being as productive as possible and we want to leverage technology to do that.Dylan SmithAnd to build on that, I think our approach internally is pretty similar to what Aaron described on the overall knowledge worker dynamic, and it's a bit early to tell just exactly how this impacts everything and how AI ends up being embedded in the various tools that we use as Boxers. But broadly, we absolutely view it as a way to boost productivity. And so automating basic questions that Boxers will be answering is one example of that, an assistant to the subtasks that Aaron mentioned. And then there's just a lot of other cool ways for specific functions where, for example, can really supercharge the capabilities of our security instant response team and kind of identify anomalous activities on Box to be able to flag certain threats earlier. So I think it's really a lot of different jobs are going to be impacted in different ways, but we view it more as supercharging productivity and getting as much value out of the different tools that we're using as possible.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey with KeyBanc.Thomas BlakeyA few questions actually just kind of bolted here. Could you just comment on the longer duration in deals? Just interesting, given the current macro, if you could just highlight why this might be happening, whether it be strategic reasoning or possibly even maybe discounting? Secondly, you mentioned quickly doing there on weaker bookings at the end of fiscal 4Q. Could you just maybe comment on booking trends and fiscal 1Q and into fiscal Q2, that would be helpful. And third and lastly, my AI question would be more around on the usage of it from your business model. I've seen some -- we've seen some impact on company's gross margins or at least modeled to have an impact on gross margins over time as especially the consumption-based modeling could maybe impact gross margin. It would be helpful just to get a comment on you from you doing on a longer-term look there with regard to AI and the model -- and the margins would be very helpful.Aaron LevieSure. So we'll start and try and then if I miss something or the question -- but no, all good. So I would say on the duration component, first of all, that is something that we've actually been seeing pretty consistently for several quarters now where while it is a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are seeing for our customers increasing the viewing Box as a long-term strategic partner. And so especially with suites deals, Enterprise Plus and our larger customers, those tend to be multiyear renewals. And as -- when you combine that with the dynamic of more customers early renewing, so extending the average kind of contract durations out there. That's what's led to the outsized backlog growth. So that's up 22% year-on-year and is not because of any unusual or different approach to pricing or discounting that we're doing. It's more just customers having that long-term confidence and electing to sign longer contracts with us. In terms of the booking trends comparing kind of what we saw in Q4 of last year versus Q1 of this year, would generally describe it as pretty similar with most parts of the business kind of steady and delivering against our expectations. The areas that we called out, where we did see some incremental softening were U.S. commercial and EMEA customers. And then I would say it's a bit early to comment on Q2, but certainly, our expectations and what we're seeing in the business is baked into the guidance that we provided. And then to clarify on the gross margin, the question was that more about how we think AI will impact that specifically.Jason Noah AderNo. With regard -- we've seen some companies, for example, offering AI functionality to customers where that's adversely impacted their business model from a gross margin perspective. I was wondering if you want to make a comment on that. .Aaron LevieYes. This is Aaron. I'll just jump in on that one. It kind of goes back to the first part, we think some of the basic use cases, we do want to try and make more broadly available, and by virtue of those being kind of lighter weight, we see less of a meaningful gross margin impact on that. And then for more of the advanced and kind of higher end use cases, we expect to charge customers in either moving them up to higher tier plans or through consumption models via our platform. And so in general, we're working to counteract any of the potential pressures. We're very confident in our long-term gross margin improvements. And we believe that some of these capabilities will just get based in -- built in as a baseline. But overall, not in a way that we think will show up to the numbers we're reporting.OperatorYour next question comes from Chad Bennett with Craig-Hallum.Chad Michael BennettSo just a follow-up on the duration question. So just in terms of how we think about the kind of the economics you've laid out on moving from kind of a single seat kind of point product to suite in Enterprise Plus and whatnot that you've laid out over a couple of Analyst Days, are those economics or uplift are they still intact with the longer-duration deals? I'm assuming these longer duration deals kind of lean more suite driven than anything else. Just any commentary on how those economics are playing out?Dylan SmithYes, those economics, specifically kind of the difference and the higher -- kind of stronger customer economics, top to bottom, including the pricing uplift if you're comparing a typical suit/enterprise plus customer versus a similarly sized customer just using the basic service. We are still seeing roughly a doubling in price per seat. And actually, on the contract duration, it's always been the case since we rolled out Suites and then Enterprise Plus that those have tended to be longer multiyear deals. And it's just as more and more of our revenue is coming from those customers, it's part of that mix shift that's actually driving the higher average contract durations. So not even a big change in the last quarter or very recently, we have been seeing backlog growing faster than revenue or deferred revenue for quite some time now.Chad Michael BennettOkay. And then just maybe for a little bit of a look back on net retention, just considering your churn rate just continues to -- full churn continues to get better or stay at kind of record levels in a good way. Just from net retention from 112 to I think you said 106 today, kind of just -- can you rank order whether it's kind of seat growth or suite adoption? Or what's kind of really the main drivers of that deceleration?Dylan SmithYes, sure. So it's actually -- and maybe the level set for everyone's benefit, there are really 3 components of our net retention rate. There's the seat expansion. There's the impact of pricing changes -- historically for us, pricing improvements and then the full churn rate comes out of those 2 expansion levers. And the stack rank in this case is pretty straightforward in that virtually all of it is attributable to a lower seat expansion. So we've continued to see consistent, steady improvements in price per seats, largely driven by the impact of more and more customers moving into suites at a higher price point. And then to your point, full churn has remained stable and very strong as well. So it really is entirely being driven by the pressures on the seat expansion rate.Chad Michael BennettOkay. And then maybe one last one, if I could, real quick. Did you -- I might have missed it. Did you comment, Dylan, on how to think about billings growth for the year relative to revenue growth? And then I'll hop off.Dylan SmithYes. So we expect our reported billings growth to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range, and that does include a little more than 100 basis point headwind from FX. So in the general range of our expected reported revenue growth of 6% is how we describe that.OperatorYour next question comes from Rishi Jaluria from RBC.Rishi Nitya JaluriaTwo for you. First, I'll cross another generative AI question just because it's so top of mind for everyone. But I want to think about the opportunities for you to maybe verticalize gen AI, especially given you are targeting a lot of verticals like health care, financial services, public sector, where, in many cases, you are a system of record. So it feels like there's some potential benefit there. But maybe if you could walk us through how you're thinking about the verticalization opportunity. That would be helpful. And then I've got a quick follow-up.Aaron LevieYes. So you're spot on that -- the value in AI certainly increases the closer to the business process and the business domain that you can get to, kind of the general productivity horizontal elements are super exciting, very flashy, but the real business value is going to come when you can go to a health care provider and say, we can automate critical workflows of health record reviews or authoring. When you go to a talent agency and say, we can review movie scripts and get them routed to the right talent agent to take a look at or where you can go to finance and have earnings reports being read and kind of key insights being pulled out. .So I think over time, we'll find the sort of pockets of specialization based on critical use cases that we see either being repeatable or where there's heavy kind of customer concentration. And either things like our professional services organization or through partners or through our sales motion, really try and make it easy for customers to adopt those kind of capabilities, and then over time, establish, like, for instance, workflow patterns in Box Relay that might leverage AI through templated approaches that make sense on a per vertical basis. I think you have a lot of ways that this will start to show up within the product that we're just at the early stages of kind of scratching the service up. But I do think the vertical use cases will be one of the ways that this gets really delivered from a value standpoint.Rishi Nitya JaluriaWonderful. Really helpful. And then really quickly, apologies if I missed this. Any color on momentum in Japan and how we should be thinking about that going forward for the rest of the year?Aaron LevieYes. I think just the high-level color would be is still very resilient for us. A lot of great wins in the quarter across everything from government agencies to manufacturers to financial services, so kind of a strong quarter in Japan. And we're still -- we have, we think, reasonable and kind of healthy expectations for the results this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James.Brian Christopher PetersonAnd I'll keep it to one, in shocking way, it's an AI question. But Aaron, you mentioned in the past that content on Box is more valuable than content on legacy solutions. There's a lot of megatrends that are driving growth for your business, cloud security, et cetera. How do you view these LLM use cases as like a tipping point in terms of facilitating movement off of these legacy solutions. Is it one of the many or is it game changing? I just want to understand -- I know it's early, but how significant could this be at a high level of for you, I guess, maybe taking a 5- to 10-year outlook?Aaron LevieYes. Great question. So it's actually -- it's probably 2 components. One is the sort of the legacy element. I can't imagine a product architecture -- technical architecture where you could take like a legacy network file share or legacy ECM on-premises system and somehow connect that to GPT4 and reasonably get any kind of experience that would work or be operable that customers would drive value from. So on that standpoint, it totally is -- it should be the nail in the coffin of kind of legacy on-prem content management and infrastructure to the extent they want the use cases that AI delivers. There's another element which is pretty exciting as well that we're starting to see customers just incrementally, but we'll obviously push on this more -- just incrementally start to really understand is fragmented data is just as much of a problem as content and legacy systems. And the reason for that is, let's say, you wanted to solve this problem of -- you want your sales reps and your companies be able to instantly get answers to questions about all of your product catalog. And and you want them to be able to go to an interface and just ask a question of what's the latest pricing for this product. Well, if your data is across lots of different systems, you will run into a bunch of challenges, which is the access permissions of that content might be different across each product, which makes it very, very hard to then reason through that data and ensure that the right people have access to that information. The individual interfaces for those products are going to be totally different for interacting with that data. And so you just want to be able to solve the problem of helping you reason through or understanding -- understand your unstructured content at scale. .And so we think this increasingly is going to cause enterprises to really start to pay attention to their content architecture, how is their content managed? Where is it managed? How fragmented is it? How do they get it into a spot with access controls and security and privacy that works in a modern way that they can bring AI to? And so even beyond the legacy element, the fragmentation element of content today we think customers are going to pay a lot more attention to having to do a couple of sessions with 2 groups of about kind of 20 or so CIOs from Fortune a couple of hundred companies, and you could see there's sort of eyes light up to the challenge that they're about to run into with content architecture. And a significant portion of these customers were not Box customers. They were just across the industry. And for the first time, they realized both simultaneously how much value was in their content because you could start to ask all of this unstructured data questions, and at the exact same time that they don't have the architecture that will let them get value out of that data based on the current course and speed that their infrastructure is running on. So we think it's going to bring up a really compelling, exciting conversations for companies. And we're going to come to the table pretty hard on the message and then make sure that we have the best platform for working with content in AI.This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I now would like to turn the call back to Cynthia Hiponia.Cynthia HiponiaGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining this afternoon, and we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.]"

And when it comes to A.I., the show provided further evidence of just how far ahead of the game Nvidia is as the leading producer of the computer chips that are powering the current A.I. revolution.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Jensen Huang, the company’s Taiwan-born CEO, bantered with the crowd in Taiwanese during parts of his keynote address to the conference and was clearly reveling in his status as a homegrown hero as his company closed in on a $1 trillion market valuation—a milestone it hit today, a day after Huang’s keynote, becoming the first chipmaker ever to reach that lofty height. Thanks to investor enthusiasm for the generative A.I. boom that is being built atop Nvidia’s graphics processing units, the company’s stock is up more than 180% year to date.At the show, Huang announced that Nvidia’s Grace Hopper GH200 “superchips”—as the company terms them—are now in full production. These chips combine Nvidia’s highest-performing Hopper H100 graphics processing units, now the top-of-the-line chip for generative A.I. workloads, with its Grace CPU, or central processing unit, that can handle a more diverse set of computing tasks.Huang revealed that the company had linked 256 of these GH200 chips together using the company’s own NVLink networking technology to create a supercomputer that can power applications requiring up to 144 terabytes of memory. The new supercomputer is designed for training ultra-large language models, complex recommendation algorithms, and graph neural networks that are used for some fraud detection and data analytics applications. Nvidia said the first customers for this supercomputer will be Microsoft, Google, and Meta.Story continuesOf course, Nvidia has recently branched out from hardware and begun offering its own fully-trained A.I. foundation models. At Computex, the company tried to demonstrate some of these A.I. capabilities in a demo geared towards Computex’s PC and video gaming crowd. It showed a video depicting how its A.I.-powered graphics rendering chips and large language models can be coupled to create non-player characters for a computer game that are more realistic and less scripted, than those that currently exist. Well, the visuals in the scene, which was set in a ramen shop in a kind of Tokyo underworld, were arrestingly cinematic. But the LLM-generated dialogue, as many commentators noted, seemed no less stilted than the canned dialogue that humans script for non-player characters in existing games. Clearly, Nvidia’s Nemo LLM may need some further fine-tuning.As any student of power politics or game theory knows, hegemons tend to beget alliances aimed at countering their overwhelming strength. In the past month, news accounts reported that Microsoft was collaborating with AMD, Nvidia’s primary rival in the graphics rendering sphere, on a possible A.I.-specific chip that could make Microsoft less reliant on purchasing Nvidia’s GPUs. (Microsoft later said aspects of the report were wrong, but that it has long had efforts to see if it could develop its own computer chips.) George Hotz, a Silicon Valley hacker and merry prankster best known for jailbreaking iPhones and Playstations and who went on to build a self-driving car in his own garage, also announced he was starting a software company called Tiny Corp. dedicated to creating software that will make AMD’s GPUs competitive with Nvidia’s. If that effort is successful, Hotz declared he would turn to building his own silicon. “If we even have a 3% chance of dethroning NVIDIA and eating in to their 80% margins, we will be very very rich,"" Hotz wrote on his blog. ""If we succeed at this project, we will be on the cutting edge of non-NVIDIA AI compute.""In his blog, Hotz notes that most A.I. chip startups that hoped to dethrone Nvidia have failed. Some, such as Cerebras and Graphcore are still trying, but both have struggled to gain as much traction as they had hoped. Microsoft tried using Graphcore in its data centers but then pivoted away from the U.K.-based startup’s chips. And Hotz is right about identifying one of Nvidia’s biggest advantages: It’s not Nvidia’s hardware, it’s its software. Cuda, the middleware layer that is used to implement A.I. applications on Nvidia’s chips, is not only effective, it is hugely popular and well-supported. An estimated 3 million developers use Cuda. That makes Nvidia’s chips, despite their expense, extremely sticky. Where many rivals have gone wrong is in trying to attack Nvidia on silicon alone, without investing in building a software architecture and developer ecosystem that could rival Cuda. Hotz is going after Cuda.But there is more to Nvidia’s market dominance than just powerful silicon and Cuda. There’s also the way it can link GPUs together inside data centers. One of Huang’s greatest acquisitions was Israeli networking company Mellanox, which Nvidia bought for $6.9 billion in 2019. Mellanox has given Nvidia a serious leg up on competitors like AMD. Michael Kagan, Nvidia’s chief technology officer, who had also been CTO at Mellanox before the acquisition, recently told me that one of the ways Nvidia had wrung more efficiency out of its data center GPUs was to move some of the computing into the network equipment itself. (He likened it to a pizza shop that, in order to get more efficient, equipped its delivery drivers with portable ovens so the pizza would finish cooking as the delivery driver drove it to a customer’s house.) And Nvidia isn’t sitting still when it comes to networking either. At Computex, the company announced a new ethernet network called Spectrum X that it says can deliver 1.7 times better performance and energy efficiency for generative A.I. workloads.Improvements like this will make Nvidia very hard to catch. Of course, Nvidia isn’t perfect. And we’ll have more on one area of the generative A.I. race where it may have stumbled in the Brainfood section below.With that, here’s more of this week’s A.I. news.Jeremy Kahn@jeremyakahnjeremy.kahn@fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

To see more such ETFs, go directly to 5 Best AI ETFs to Invest In 2023.The stock market is all about AI these days. Investors, venture capitalists and investment funds are pouring money into AI companies. Nvidia’s latest rally, which saw the company gaining a whopping $190 billion in market value in a single day, is a case in point that shows how a very few players are benefitting from the latest AI-driven rally. Big seven tech companies — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — added a combined $454 billion in value in just five days. This huge concentration of gains have made some analysts uneasy as they think this lack of breadth in the market could backfire.Valuation Worries ReturnBloomberg in a recent report quoted Michael Mullaney, director of global research for Boston Partners, who warned about high valuations and expectations, something the market has paid a steep price for in the past.“These are good companies. They’re not going bankrupt. But people are starting to pay exorbitant prices for them. It feels frenzy-ish. If the leadership was all crappy companies like we saw in 2000, it would be game over very shortly"", Mullaney said.Similarly, The Wall Street Journal quoted Andy Constan, chief executive officer of Damped Spring Advisors, who thinks that if overall economic productivity doesn’t rise to match these AI-driven gains in stock prices, it could lead to losses.“The overall economy is not rising at the gains these stock prices represent. That makes me worried for the valuations.”Why Did Cathie Wood Sell NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ?Cathie Wood, one of the biggest proponents of AI and the innovation brought about in the world due to this technology, recently talked to Bloomberg. Asked why she sold NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and how she feels about missing the big rally the company saw recently, the 67-year-old manager of ARK Investment said her fund bought Nvidia in the last quarter of 2022 and since then the stock tripled until it sold the stock.Story continuesWood said her fund looks at relative valuations in the AI sector and piled into some other stocks that are poised to benefit from the AI industry. Wood added that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at 25 times sales while Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which she thinks is “probably the biggest AI stock out there,” is six times sales. Wood also mentioned UiPath and called it a “beautiful” AI play and highlighted that the company too trades as six times sales.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Challenges?Cathie Wood also mentioned some challenges NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could face in the future. She said that the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry could pose a risk to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Similarly, increased competition fueled by major companies like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) coming up with their own chips for large language models could also affect the demand.Asked whether she received any negative feedback from investors on selling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) too early, Wood said she hasn’t received much pushback from investors and emphasized that her fund is “on AI” but in a ""differentiated"" way. Wood added that her fund is looking for those AI companies which have “vision” from the “management” point of view, proprietary data and AI expertise.Investing in thematic ETFs is perhaps the best way to gain from a market trend. This year has seen a dramatic rise in AI-based ETFs. Data from Bloomberg shows that 14 US-based ETFs which have “artificial intelligence” in their fund descriptions saw a whopping $338 million in inflows this yearBest AI ETFs to Invest In 2023Image by Alexandra_Koch from PixabayOur MethodologyFor this article, we scoured important ETF offerings available in the market today and picked 11 ETFs that give exposure to companies that are directly or indirectly involved in the development of AI software, hardware, and services.

Greg Maffei, executive chairman of Qurate Retail, said it was Rawlinson’s ability to bring an “outside perspective to a well-established business” that made him the person to lead Qurate.—Paolo ConfinoVery unconventionalAndrew MacDonald SVP, Mobility at Uber photographed at Uber HQ in San Francisco on Monday May 8, 2023. Winni Wintermeyer for FortuneAndrew MacDonaldSVP of MobilityUberMacdonald was tapped to lead Uber’s global rideshare business in 2019, though he’s been with the company since May 2012, working his way up to vice president of Americas operations and global business development before his current role. Macdonald, 39, oversees the company’s rideshare business globally, as well as other divisions including car sharing and micromobility (bikes and scooters). The company has greatly disrupted the taxi industry since its founding in 2009, but Macdonald has spearheaded efforts to collaborate with the industry, aiming to list every NYC taxi—and then every taxi in the world—on Uber.—Paige McGlauflinEric Glyman, CEO of Ramp Courtesy of RampEric GlymanCofounder and CEORampGlyman, 33, cofounded Ramp in 2019 with a simple idea: offer companies a corporate credit card and software designed to help them spend less. Traditional corporate cards emphasize other benefits and may offer rewards points to incentivize spending. Ramp helps employers direct and monitor what employees spend and speeds up expense reports and accounting for end-of-month closings. Ramp’s most recent private investment round, in March 2022, valued the company at $8.1 billion.

MedTech’s 60,000 employees are 40% of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s total. Earlier she was president of J&amp;J’s McNeil consumer business, which makes Tylenol, Zyrtec, Mylanta, and other over-the-counter drugs. J&amp;J has recently divided itself in two, with its consumer businesses forming a separate company called Kenvue.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving. With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Synopsys SNPS, Descartes Systems Group DSGX and Blackbaud BLKB.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (mostly for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform. Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS open up opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Cloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents drives demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to the cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps deliver a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Macroeconomic Headwinds a Concern: The mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions, among others. However, global macroeconomic weakness, geopolitical instability in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine war and lingering supply chain troubles are a concern. Increasing inflation could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector.

Crum's previous sales estimate stood at $325 million.Movie industry blogs are buzzing that the film, which is being distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (WBD), could have an opening weekend of around $31 million.""We think anticipation leading up to its July 21 theatrical release creates a near-term trading opportunity,"" Crum wrote. ""Why? Because 1) Barbie is arguably the company's most important brand; 2) Barbie is the first of several movie releases from Mattel Films, with a stated mission to be, 'an IP-driven toy business,' and thus we see a successful launch as driving greater confidence around this part of the company's strategy; and 3) a higher box office = higher profits for Mattel ~ since the company did not fund production our estimates (including adj. EPS = $0.08) are admittedly modest, but a stronger showing in theaters certainly can't hurt numbers.""Barbie and Ken are shown in the ""Barbie"" Movie trailer. (Warner Bros./screenshot)The analyst maintained a Buy rating on Mattel's stock.Mattel's ""Barbie"" movie is a live-action flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It was directed by Greta Gerwig, and reportedly had a budget of up to $100 million to make.Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz thinks the release could be a legacy-making event for the company, which has made consumer toys for decades but is now venturing into the content space.""That will be a catalyst,"" Kreiz said on Yahoo Finance Live at the 2023 Milken Institute Global Conference (video above). ""This is the first time that Mattel is putting a movie out based on any of our [intellectual property], any of our franchises. Barbie is clearly an important brand. It's one of our three power brands, and it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios.""Story continuesKreiz said that Mattel has 14 content projects in development including a Warner Bros. movie based on toy car brand Matchbox.So for Mattel, a lot is riding on the ""Barbie"" movie, and it comes at a critical time financially.The movie is slated to arrive as Mattel's stock price has lost 25% in the past year as consumers pulled back on discretionary items amid record-high inflation and a slowing economy.Mattel's first quarter sales fell 22%, and the company said it was still working to clear excess inventory. The company posted an $86.7 million adjusted operating loss in the first quarter, down sharply from a $90.1 million profit a year earlier.""Management sounded confident inventory was being worked down in line with expectations, second half would 'return to normal', and green shoots abound in the toy industry,"" Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said after Mattel's quarter. ""We somewhat agree when looking at Mattel share gains, execution, and resilient categories like wheels, but continue to worry about point of sale and heavily-weighted second half to hit guidance.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for American International Group is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for American International Group imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for American International GroupFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this insurer is expected to earn $6.58 per share, which is a change of 44.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for American International Group. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 8% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. This indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.For those interested in the sector, we have earmarked three stocks — Murphy USA MUSA, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX — all sporting solid fundamental and valuation profiles.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Murphy USA: This is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA’s acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Murphy USA shares have found buyers over the last month, climbing 2% in value and outperforming the S&amp;P 500 modestly. The company’s latest earnings results were solid too. MUSA posted earnings of $4.80 per share, 18% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS). Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Murphy USA totaled $5.1 billion, slightly above expectations.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Importantly, the company’s shares looks reasonable regarding valuation, with the current forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.28 sitting just above the five-year median and well below the Zacks that Oil – Energy sector average.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinally, MUSA remains committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through continued share buyback programs. As part of this initiative, the fuel retailer recently approved a repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion following the completion of the existing $1 billion mandate.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to the lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).MPC reported last on May 2, and results came in above expectations. The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS by more than 6%. Quarterly revenues totaled $35.1 billion, $2.6 billion above estimates. Analysts have become bullish on the company’s current year, with the annual EPS estimate being revised nearly 2% higher in the past week.MPC, which has a VGM Score of A, also remains committed to returning excess cash flow. The company repurchased $3.2 billion of shares and a further $1.2 billion worth of shares in April. Moreover, Marathon Petroleum gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval and currently has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.In particular, shares could entice value-focused investors, with the current 5.66X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 10.21X five-year median and Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Phillips 66’ adjusted first-quarter earnings more than tripled year over year to $4.21 a share, blowing by the consensus EPS estimates by 18%. The #3 Ranked company has now topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS by an average of 13.5% in the trailing four quarters.Investors should also be pleased to know that its 4.43% dividend yield comfortably tops the S&amp;P 500’s 1.51%. Meanwhile, PSX enjoys a VGM Composite Score of A.Phillips 66’ valuation levels are looking attractive at the moment. It is trading at a 47% discount to its five-year median and a roughly 16% discount to the Zacks Oil-Energy sector at just 6.61X forward 12-month earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, TSCO benefited from its Life Out Here Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy product demand.Notably, sales grew 9.1% year over year to $3,299.2 million, driven by contributions from the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition concluded in October 2022, store openings, and increased comparable store sales (comps). Comps improved 2.1%, led by growth in comparable average tickets, offset by a decline in comparable average transactions.The company’s comparable average ticket improved 2.8%, while the comparable average transaction count was down 0.7%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comp growth.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for ADM’s current financial year have increased 0.3% to $10.49 over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperThe company has been focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. It is on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy aimed at connecting stores and online shopping. Some of its notable omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app.In the first quarter, its e-commerce business performed well, with its mobile app representing more than 20% of its digital sales. Earlier, it launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in store and anywhere Visa is accepted. Tractor Supply exited the first quarter with more than 30 million Neighbor's Club members. The company’s rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners.Also, TSCO is progressing well with its Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars, which include customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return. As part of the plans, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026.Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously projected 8-10%. Earlier, the company launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”) and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.Tractor Supply is also in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant.Moving on, the expansion of the company’s store base and the incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line bode well. In the first quarter, it opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. As of Apr 1, 2023, it operated 2,164 Tractor Supply stores across 49 states, including 81 Orscheln Farm and Home acquired in 2022. The company expects to complete the conversion of 81 Orscheln Farm and Home to Tractor Supply stores by the end of 2023.Story continuesDriven by these factors, management expects fiscal 2023 net sales of $15-$15.3 billion. Comp growth is likely to be 3.5-5.5%. The company is likely to witness comp sales toward the top half of its guidance in the second quarter.TSCO also anticipates strength in CUE products and DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Its second and third quarters are anticipated to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while the fourth quarter is expected to be at the low end of the guidance range. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%.Hurdles on the WayDespite these upsides, Tractor Supply has been reeling under rising costs. In first-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 119 bps year over year to 28.1%.In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 13.9% year over year to $925.5 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the deleverage due to moderate comps, and higher depreciation and amortization; the opening of a distribution center; and the impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition. Also, cost inflation is concerning.ConclusionOnline strength, solid demand and well-chalked-out endeavors are likely to help the stock sustain its momentum. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.6% and a VGM Score of B drive optimism.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

The findings will be presented at the 2023 European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR), taking place May 31-June 3 in Milan, Italy.""Research presented at EULAR sheds new light on psoriatic arthritis and the role of our oral medication Otezla,"" said Ponda Motsepe-Ditshego, vice president, Global Medical at Amgen. ""Using MRI, the MOSAIC study visually captured an improvement in inflammation and no significant change in structural progression, with the effects being greater in patients with moderate as opposed to high disease activity.""MOSAIC Phase 4 StudyUnlike X-ray imaging – commonly used to assess joint damage caused by psoriatic arthritis – MOSAIC used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a more sensitive tool for imaging inflammation, which begins early and continues throughout the disease course in joints and entheses (sites where tendons or ligaments attach to bones). MOSAIC evaluated Otezla's effect on joint inflammation and structural progression of psoriatic arthritis measured by MRI.""MOSAIC is the first study to use MRI to assess inflammation in peripheral joints and entheses in a clinical trial, and shows MRI offers a promising way to measure inflammatory disease activity in patients with this condition,"" said Professor Mikkel Østergaard, M.D., Ph.D., DMSc, Copenhagen Center for Arthritis Research, Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""The results of this study are encouraging, as they provide important insights about Otezla treatment and its efficacy on both clinical and inflammatory manifestations of psoriatic arthritis.""Story continuesIn MOSAIC, a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study, patients with active psoriatic arthritis who were treated with Otezla for 48 weeks had MRI of the hand (contrast-enhanced) performed at baseline, week 24 and week 48. The study evaluated change from baseline in the composite score of hand bone marrow edema (BME), synovitis and tenosynovitis in fingers 2-5, assessed by the psoriatic arthritis MRI score (PsAMRIS) at week 24 (the primary endpoint). Total inflammation score, comprised of BME, synovitis, tenosynovitis and periarticular inflammation in fingers, as well as structural progression, were also assessed.Patients treated with Otezla had improvements in both clinical and MRI measures of inflammation up to week 48. Detailed findings include:Inflammation improved, reflected in the mean change from baseline in the composite inflammation score of BME, synovitis, and tenosynovitis as assessed by PsAMRIS for the full analysis set (n=98), which was -2.32 (-4.73, 0.09) at week 24 and -2.91 (-5.45, -0.37) at week 48. Significant improvements at week 24 and 48 in the per protocol population (n=94) were also observed.No significant structural progression was observed with Otezla. Total damage score – a measure of disease progression – including bone erosion, showed no significant change at weeks 24 and 48.In addition, patients with moderate disease activity as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (cDAPSA) experienced greater reductions in inflammation with Otezla as compared to those with high disease activity.Common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (33.6%), nausea (12.3%), headache (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (7.4%) and dyspepsia (6.6%).Findings will be presented Friday, June 2 at 12:10 p.m. CEST: POS0226, Poster Tour Session: Apremilast Reduces Inflammation as Measured by MRI of the Hand in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis: Primary Results from the Phase 4 MOSAIC Study.Otezla's Effect on Cardiometabolic Parameters in Psoriatic ArthritisA second EULAR presentation includes data evaluating the effects of Otezla on cardiometabolic parameters (low- and high-density lipoprotein [LDL, HDL], body mass index [BMI] and HbA1c levels) in 781 patients with psoriatic arthritis at 52 weeks. The post-hoc exploratory analysis of data from five pooled Phase 3 trials (PALACE 1-4, ACTIVE) showed Otezla treatment was associated with improvement in cardiometabolic parameters across psoriatic disease activity groups. Among the findings reported:Mean LDL in the overall population at baseline decreased by 2.0 mg/dL on average at week 52; 52.3% of patients moved from the high LDL category (≥160 mg/dL) at baseline to borderline (&gt;129 – &lt;160 mg/dL) or normal (≤129 mg/dL) at week 52; and 38.3% changed from borderline high to normal LDL levels.Mean BMI was 30.3 kg/m2 in the overall population at baseline and decreased by 0.5 kg/m2 at week 52; 9.0% of patients changed from the obese category (≥30 kg/m2) to the overweight category (25 – &lt;30 kg/m2) and 12.3% of patients changed from the overweight category to the normal category (&lt;25 kg/m2).50.4% of patients who had prediabetes changed to normal HbA1c levels and 40.0% moved from diabetes to prediabetes at week 52.Findings will be presented Saturday, June 3 at 10:30 a.m. CEST: POS1527, Poster Session: Effects of Apremilast on Changes in Cardiometabolic Parameters by Diabetes and Obesity Status in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis.About Psoriatic Arthritis     Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory form of arthritis, which can cause swelling, stiffness and pain in and around the joints that worsens over time and can decrease physical function. It is estimated that nearly 38 million people worldwide have psoriatic arthritis.1 Around a third of people living with psoriasis may go on to develop psoriatic arthritis.1 If left untreated, psoriatic arthritis can cause disability.About Otezla® (apremilast)          Otezla® (apremilast) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which Otezla exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined.Since its initial FDA approval in 2014, Otezla has been prescribed to more than 840,000 patients worldwide.2Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. INDICATIONS  INDICATIONSOtezla® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçet's Disease.Otezla® (apremilast) U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONContraindicationsOtezla® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulationWarnings and PrecautionsHypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during postmarketing surveillance. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Otezla and institute appropriate therapyDiarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomitingDepression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occurWeight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of OtezlaDrug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong CYP450 enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommendedAdverse ReactionsPlaque Psoriasis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache, including tension headache. Overall, the safety profile of Otezla in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis was consistent with the safety profile previously established in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasisPsoriatic Arthritis: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are diarrhea, nausea, and headacheBehçet's Disease: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) are diarrhea, nausea, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection.Use in Specific PopulationsOtezla has not been studied in pregnant women.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data.

Default risks are off the table for the next two can-kicking years.On paper, the resolution should bring some calm to debt markets and ratchet down the commentary coming from C-suite leaders at various investment bank conferences this week and in June.By no means is the deal perfect.One has to wonder how consumer spending will be impacted as the freeze on student loans gets lifted in early September as part of the agreement. And two, the government spending caps could take a bite out of the economy.But at least for today, a teensy bit of calm to a market that had grown jittery the past two weeks (see small-cap and defense stocks lagging, for instance).Don't get too comfortable, however.The market will now shift its gaze the Federal Reserve and whether it will lift interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Pros say it's a true toss up which direction the Fed will go, suggesting any debt ceiling market calm may prove short-lived.""In our view, the decision on whether to raise rates is so finely balanced that it could still go either way depending on how events unfold between now and the meeting,"" points out UBS senior economist Brian Rose. ""At one point, markets had almost completely priced out another hike, but currently the market sees around a 50% chance of one more hike, either at the June meeting or at the following meeting on 25–26 July.""There are strong cases for both.Inflation is still far above the Fed's 2% target and the unemployment rate is at a historically low 3.4%. The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report showed long-run inflation expectations near 20 year highs.If this Friday's May employment report hits above the consensus of around 200,000, it would be yet another data point to push the Fed into one more rate increase.Story continuesMarkets wouldn't like that, and could trade off into the June Fed meeting.On the other hand, the Fed has lifted rates 500 basis points from the lows. That's a lot of tightening, and it's beginning to show up in the economy.Consumers are cutting back on discretionary purchases, as we learned from earnings out of Target, Best Buy, Walmart, RH and Urban Outfitters last week. You will likely sense a similar vibe in earnings out this week from Dollar General and Macy's.Inflation has in fact trended lower.Auto delinquencies are on the rise, as closely followed Apollo Group economist Torsten Slok noted in a piece of weekend research that crossed my inbox.""The economy is balanced on a knife's edge,"" United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told me last week on Yahoo Finance Live. ""When the Silicon Valley banking scare started, we saw a 15% overnight drop in business bookings, and that tells you the economy is very fragile.""These economic clues suggest that the Fed needs to chill out with rate hikes before it induces a recession, or worse.All in all, a tough call by the Fed soon.And that means it remains a tough call among bulls and bears...despite the debt ceiling debacle hibernating for two years.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for General Dynamics:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$52b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, General Dynamics has an ROCE of 12%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10.0% generated by the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for General Dynamics compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For General Dynamics Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at General Dynamics doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 19% over the last five years. However it looks like General Dynamics might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOn a side note, General Dynamics has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 30% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.The Bottom LineBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by General Dynamics' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 15% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for General Dynamics   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

LMT recently announced that its unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for the full-rate production of the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program’s (“SEWIP”) AN/SLQ-32(V)6 and AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 systems. The deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Valued at $67.9 million, the contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Liverpool, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending on improved surveillance and countermeasure capability against naval threats like anti-ship missiles.Backed by such demand and the need to make the electronic warfare threat detection system more prompt, SEWIP was introduced by Lockheed Martin. SEWIP was designed to provide enhanced electronic warfare capabilities to existing and new ship combat systems to improve anti-ship missile defense, counter-targeting and counter-surveillance capabilities.With the capability to conduct both littoral and open-ocean electronic surveillance, SEWIP has been in the portfolio of the electric warfare system of the U.S. Navy for many years, and its demand may continue to increase manifold in the days ahead. Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4.7% during the 2022-2027 period.The expanding market size and the advantages of the electronic warfare system offered by LMT make SEWIP an attractive option for the Navy, thereby resulting in Lockheed Martin winning orders for the same, like the latest one. These developments are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Peer ProspectsApart from Lockheed Martin, defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of additional spending on electronic warfare systems and thus witness a probable inflow of orders are as follows:Story continuesGeneral Dynamics GD has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD’s 2023 earnings suggests an improvement of 3.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman’s NOC Block 3 SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system and provides the game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet. The advantage of this electronic attack system is that it provides a non-kinetic, soft-kill magazine to defeat inbound threats.Northrop’s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 earnings has moved upward by 2.1% in the past 60 days.L3Harris Technologies’ LHX Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on the advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize survivability and mission success. Some other products of the company are AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, the F-16 self-protection system, the AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.LHX’s long-term earnings growth rate is 2.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 1.9% against the industry’s fall of 5.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Data released today for March 2023 show a continuing recovery in housing prices, as all 20 major metro markets reported month-over-month price increases. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 0.7% annual gain in March, down from 2.1% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite showed a decrease of -0.8%, down from 0.5% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a -1.1% year-over-year loss, down from a 0.4% gain in the previous month.Miami, Tampa, and Charlotte reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in March. Miami led the way once again with a 7.7% year-over-year price increase, followed by Tampa in second with a 4.8% increase, and Charlotte replacing Atlanta in third with a 4.7% increase. There are 19 of 20 cities reporting lower prices in the year ending March 2023 versus the year ending February 2023, with only Chicago showing an increase at 0.4%.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a 1.3% month-over-month increase in March, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted increases of 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month increase of 0.4%, while the 10-City Composite gained 0.6% and 20-City Composites posted an increase of 0.5%.ANALYSIS""The modest increases in home prices we saw a month ago accelerated in March 2023,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI. ""The National Composite rose by 1.3% in March, and now stands only 3.6% below its June 2022 peak.  Our 10- and 20-City Composites performed similarly, with March gains of 1.6% and 1.5% respectively.  On a trailing 12-month basis, the National Composite is only 0.7% above its level in March 2022, with the 10- and 20-City Composites modestly negative on a year-over-year basis.Story continues""The acceleration we observed nationally was also apparent at a more granular level.  Before seasonal adjustment, prices rose in all 20 cities in March (versus in 12 in February), and in all 20 price gains accelerated between February and March.  Seasonally adjusted data showed 15 cities with rising prices in March (versus 11 in February), with acceleration in 14 cities.""One of the most interesting aspects of our report continues to lie in its stark regional differences.  Miami's 7.7% year-over-year gain made it the best-performing city for the eighth consecutive month. Tampa (+4.8%) continued in second place, narrowly ahead of bronze medalist Charlotte (+4.7%).  The farther west we look, the weaker prices are, with Seattle (-12.4%) now leading San Francisco (-11.2%) at the bottom of the league table.  It's unsurprising that the Southeast (+5.4%) remains the country's strongest region, while the West (-6.2%) remains the weakest.""Two months of increasing prices do not a definitive recovery make, but March's results suggest that the decline in home prices that began in June 2022 may have come to an end.  That said, the challenges posed by current mortgage rates and the continuing possibility of economic weakness are likely to remain a headwind for housing prices for at least the next several months.""Table 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrentIndexLevelDateLevelDateFrom Peak (%)LevelFrom Trough(%)From Peak(%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %297.08121.7 %60.9 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %302.30125.5 %46.4 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %315.34115.3 %39.4 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for March 2023.

Agoda has the same room on that night for $20 less, or $65.In a common scenario, the hotel might have given a private $65 rate to a wholesaler to insert into a vacation package, meaning the room rate wouldn’t be readily apparent in this flight-hotel bundle, or maybe it was meant to be a non-public rate for business travel, but then the wholesaler, unbeknownst to the hotel, releases it to an online travel agency.Here’s how Agoda.com marketed that rate ($56) before taxes and fees for the Hotel du Parc Hanoi, touting it’s the “CHEAPEST PRICE YOU’VE SEEN.”Source: AgodaIt takes little work to find these discrepancies. You can find them for Expedia, as well, but Expedia would argue not at the same magnitude as Agoda.Here’s another example as seen on Google Hotels for a June 16-17 stay at the Ibis Budget Singapore Sapphire hotel. The hotel’s published rate on its own website is $79, but Agoda has it for $65.Story continuesThen-Agoda CEO John Brown detailed his company’s philosophy on hotel prices at Skift Forum East in 2019 in Singapore. See the accompanying video. (Brown relinquished his CEO duties in 2022, and chairperson role in March this year.)Source: Skift/YouTube“If there is a rate out here for $80 that is bookable by customers around the world and Agoda doesn’t have it, I feel like it’s our duty to customers to go off and to get it,” Brown said in the video. “So whether we will contract it directly with our partners, whether we will connect to a wholesaler etc. We even have something … where we will advance cash and take inventory positions.”He said Agoda has lots of tools it can use to find these types of cheap rates. “The bottom line is if the rates are out there, we will do whatever we need to do to put them in the hands of the customer,” Brown said.A Win for Travelers, A Blow to the Hotel IndustryBrown added that Agoda’s relations with hoteliers “has not been easy, for sure” because of these practices, adding that hoteliers have the option to tell wholesalers (who often pass these rates along to Google, Kayak, Tripadvisor, Trivago, Expedia, Booking.com or Agoda) where their rates should appear and where they shouldn’t.Agoda is a Booking Holdings brand, and a Booking Holdings spokesperson defended Agoda’s practices. “Agoda does get many different rates from partners – including wholesale – but they distribute them according to partner agreements,” the spokesperson said. “Transparency with our partners is key.”Expedia, meanwhile, has skin in the game on this issue on several levels. Expedia has a tech tool called Optimized Distribution to help hotels weed out wholesale and other rates showing up in unauthorized outlets. Expedia’s partners include Marriott, IHG, and others, and it hopes to sign on more.And, as Kern acknowledges, Agoda is a competitor.Some point out that Expedia’s hands weren’t totally clean when it came to violating hotel rate parity provisions in the past, and Kern said Expedia isn’t perfect, but it is trying to make good on pledges to do the right thing.Kern said he’s amazed that some hotels don’t realize how their rates are being mishandled. Sometimes this rate undercutting might only appear from a non-U.S. point of sale, complicating matters for hotel brands that may not be headquartered in that market.“Frankly, when I talk to major CEOs of major or mid-size hospitality companies, and talk about rate issues, and speak about what optimized distribution can do, almost to a person, they’ll say they didn’t realize that,” Kern said, referring to how third parties are misusing their rates.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

It also helps businesses continue to inspire and create access for generations of women leaders to come. Women make up 47% of the workforce and hold 23% of executive positions - yet women of color consist of only 13% of the C-suite roles.Increasing representation and access for women in the workplace is a topic Dr. Tiph Turpin, Global VP of Employee Communications, has been passionate about her entire career. Faced with a lack of representation in her own field, she has dedicated her time to mentorship, advocacy, and equal opportunity in corporate spaces. We were able to connect with Tiph and learn more about her journey and guidance for other women and women of color who aspire to be in leadership.Tiph Turpin is a PRWeek 40 under 40 honoree who leads global employee communications at Expedia Group. She delivers award-winning communications and manages her teams as an impact-first organization that develops internal storytelling about Expedia Group's business strategy, sharing what it means for travel to be a force for good.On Choosing Expedia Group and TravelTiph was drawn to the travel industry and Expedia Group's vision to lead transformation through technology, especially given the way pandemic changed the way people approach travel.""After the height of the pandemic, there was a new meaning to travel. We've seen the impact travel can have, to open apertures for how we view each other, experience the world, and it can shape how we see our own potential. Being part of this passion for travel and technology drove me to join Expedia Group. There is a real spirit to run toward change and run toward innovation here.""On the Journey to VPTiph experienced continued career growth since joining Expedia Group in 2021 - from Senior Director to VP - is a considerable jump to make in anyone's career and that can have a big shift in management objectives. She shares how focusing on being a great leader to her team has been a key part of her success, and how other companies can foster growth in their teams.Story continues""In order to fully appreciate all aspects of your employees, you need to go deep into what someone wants to contribute and how they want to contribute. It's important that you understand your employees as individuals and be clear on how you and that person measures success.""Tiph shared that companies need to be more aware than ever that success looks differently for each person, and the ways success is measured need to evolve. But how do we identify that?""We start with feedback. We are in a new era in the tech ecosystem and businesses need to hold space for success to look differently for each person. One of the ways individual contributors can do this, and identify if they're ready for the next step in their career as managers or leaders, is to collect feedback.""""Keep getting feedback from that 360 angle and understand your business scope. Make sure you have a good mix of sponsors, personal champions and mentors.""On Women Navigating Imposter SyndromeMany of us have had moments of doubt - whether you're positioning yourself for a pay raise or beginning a new job. Imposter syndrome can be the fear and discomfort of ‘not checking all the boxes' or not being ready/worthy of an opportunity. It is often felt disproportionally by marginalized groups such as women and people of color due to years of systemic bias and exclusion. Tiph shares advice on battling these notions.""If you're a woman and you're not sure about your own readiness, you need to know that it's not just you. Countless studies have shown that women don't apply for opportunities unless they feel over-confident in their abilities to match the job description. It's important to recognize that notions like this can hold us back - both individually, and as a community. Use the feedback from your circle of sponsors, mentors, peers and managers.""""Don't let yourself feel stifled if you don't check all the boxes and propel yourself in the direction that is right for you.""On Prioritizing BalanceDuring the pandemic, many parents saw firsthand how career ambitions and family aspirations needed to be renegotiated and prioritized. For Tiph, this is when she learned some of the best advice she got in her career.""When I came back from maternity leave [the first time], I found myself working around the clock, hyper-focusing on getting as many tasks done as possible and emailing at all hours of the day. The advice I got from a fellow parent and mentor was that I needed to reassess how I measure my value, and impact.At that time, I felt my impact was the volume of work I was outputting. But as you grow in your career you need to think about how to become more efficient. The hours may be less, but you learn how to make your efficiency skyrocket.""On Finding Mentors to Help Redefine SuccessSometimes, it takes an external pair of eyes to push us to the next level of our performance. Tiph shares that mentors can be the catalyst for these career changes. ""You need to reevaluate how you determine success. Mentors can be very helpful in asking these types of questions with you:1. What does amazing delivery look like? 2. How am I a differentiator in the workplace? 3. How do I troubleshoot my current blockers? 4. How might I improve my efficiency?""Tiph also shares that it's important to address and be specific on what a mentor looks like and push yourself to grow into the leader you want to see. ""Sometimes, people don't think of themselves as a mentor. But we each have something unique we can provide to others- be it counsel, or advice. People need to step into that more, no matter your level! There's always space for being able to lift other folks as we climb."" __Learn more about the power of travel as a force for good at Expedia Group, our Travel Community, and how you can join us.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Expedia Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Expedia GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/expedia-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Expedia GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758038/Dr-Tiph-Turpin-Shares-How-Defining-Success-Today-Will-Land-Your-Next-Role]"

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Valued at $14.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, BA will offer manufacturing, assembly and delivery of various peculiar support equipment for the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a solid four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions.

LMT recently announced that its unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for the full-rate production of the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program’s (“SEWIP”) AN/SLQ-32(V)6 and AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 systems. The deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Valued at $67.9 million, the contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Liverpool, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending on improved surveillance and countermeasure capability against naval threats like anti-ship missiles.Backed by such demand and the need to make the electronic warfare threat detection system more prompt, SEWIP was introduced by Lockheed Martin. SEWIP was designed to provide enhanced electronic warfare capabilities to existing and new ship combat systems to improve anti-ship missile defense, counter-targeting and counter-surveillance capabilities.With the capability to conduct both littoral and open-ocean electronic surveillance, SEWIP has been in the portfolio of the electric warfare system of the U.S. Navy for many years, and its demand may continue to increase manifold in the days ahead. Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4.7% during the 2022-2027 period.The expanding market size and the advantages of the electronic warfare system offered by LMT make SEWIP an attractive option for the Navy, thereby resulting in Lockheed Martin winning orders for the same, like the latest one. These developments are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Peer ProspectsApart from Lockheed Martin, defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of additional spending on electronic warfare systems and thus witness a probable inflow of orders are as follows:Story continuesGeneral Dynamics GD has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD’s 2023 earnings suggests an improvement of 3.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman’s NOC Block 3 SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system and provides the game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet. The advantage of this electronic attack system is that it provides a non-kinetic, soft-kill magazine to defeat inbound threats.Northrop’s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.8%.

Horton, Inc. DHI, NVR, Inc. NVR, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL and Meritage Homes Corp. MTH.Industry: HomebuildingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2101459/5-top-ranked-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-homebuilding-industryThe U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, rising raw material and labor costs. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, more stabilized mortgage rates, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like D.R. Horton, Inc., NVR, Inc., PulteGroup Inc., Toll Brothers, Inc. and Meritage Homes Corp. have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities.The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties; residential real estate; and oil and gas assets.4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureSuburban Shift, Lack of Supply, Improved Builder Confidence: The changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence. Demand for new homes is improving in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.Story continuesMeanwhile, there is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders.Builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes in May inched up five points to 50 points, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. This marked the fifth straight month of builder confidence increase and the first time of sentiment levels reaching the midpoint mark of 50 since July 2022. Homebuilders are getting a major boost from the lack of existing homes for sale, helping industry players to navigate some of the challenges they are facing from financial markets.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues as well as profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. On May 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% while leaving its options open on future rate hikes.The central bank's move pushed the Fed funds rate to a new range of 5%-5.25%, the highest since September 2007. Notably, as part of the Fed’s rate hiking drive since the 1980s, the U.S. central bank has lifted the range for its benchmark interest rate by 5 percentage points since March 2022. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Tight Labor &amp; Credit Markets: Although there has been a modest improvement in the supply chain and some easing in labor constraints, supply-chain challenges are still expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times to some extent in the near term. Continuous supply-chain issues in various countries have been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time.With Europe facing severe energy crises, supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in the near term as well. Again, the shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America’s economy and infrastructure rebuilding efforts.Meanwhile, although lumber prices have been dropping since March 2023, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is a 19-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector.

However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.NWE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.14, while WEC has a forward P/E of 18.88. We also note that NWE has a PEG ratio of 2.39. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.28.Another notable valuation metric for NWE is its P/B ratio of 1.25. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.29.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to NWE's Value grade of B and WEC's Value grade of C.Story continuesNWE is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that NWE is likely the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Vulnerability, humility, and self-awareness are among the qualities that first-time CEOs must cultivate. Who will stand out in this new landscape? With the help of executive search veterans and industry experts (who asked not to be named so as not to show favoritism), Fortune has identified 11 CEO stars in the making—many of them already in the C-suite, and all potential large-company CEOs. They range in age from 33 to 56, and each was identified by one or more experts who see a generational standout leader in the making.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

Here's what they need to reach the top rungBecause executives develop in different ways, we’ve created categories for the 11 individuals. Three have built unconventional résumés that wouldn’t have put them on a CEO track in previous eras. Three have succeeded at tech companies or tech-related jobs without majoring in STEM disciplines (and of those, one is already a CEO but is likely to go on to even larger roles). Two are not yet in the top job but hold such broad responsibilities that they could step into a CEO job today. And three are women in the world’s largest and most turbulent industry, health care, which is increasingly female-led—and is developing leaders who will transform other sectors as well.Big-company tech successSarah Bond, Microsoft Corporate VP, Xbox, photographed at Microsoft offices in Redmond, Washington on May 1, 2023.

She now leads the division of Xbox that builds and commercializes products and services for game creators. That makes her a key player in a major strategic transformation: Microsoft’s ambitious effort to reorder the gaming ecosystem so anyone can play any game anywhere on any device. Among other challenges, Microsoft must change the way developers create games. Bond is also on the boards of two publicly traded corporations: Zuora (software) and Chegg (services for students).

He was an early adopter of the concept of combining marketing and technology: After majoring in marketing at the University of Washington, he worked at two startups, the visual communication software company Visio and the marketing analytics company Avenue A, both later bought by Microsoft. In 22 years at Starbucks he has broadened his experience beyond marketing and the U.S., with five years in Hong Kong and three years in Tokyo as chief operating officer of Starbucks Japan.

Prior to his appointment as Qurate’s CEO in 2021, Rawlinson shepherded NielsenIQ, a retail and consumer goods data company, through its spinoff from Nielsen’s TV ratings arm. And when he was president of online sales at industrial supplies company W.W. Grainger, he was key to building its e-commerce business. Greg Maffei, executive chairman of Qurate Retail, said it was Rawlinson’s ability to bring an “outside perspective to a well-established business” that made him the person to lead Qurate.—Paolo ConfinoVery unconventionalAndrew MacDonald SVP, Mobility at Uber photographed at Uber HQ in San Francisco on Monday May 8, 2023.

129,6510acbc-26e0-3bdb-a95b-2217a90ef9ef,WMB,2023-05-31,Caterpillar and Nutrien have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caterpillar-nutrien-highlighted-zacks-bull-121500380.html,1685448900,STORY,"['CAT', 'NTR.TO', 'NTR', 'MPLX', 'WMB', 'KMI']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 30, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Caterpillar CAT as the Bull of the Day and Nutrien NTR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc. WMB.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:A behemoth in the Zacks Industrial Products sector, Caterpillar has seen its near-term earnings outlook improve nicely over the last several months, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. We see those iconic yellow machines at nearly every construction site.The company operates through three primary segments: Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy &amp; Transportation. In addition, Caterpillar provides financing and other related services through its Financial Products segment.Current StandingCaterpillar posted better-than-expected results in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 30%. Quarterly revenue totaled $15.8 billion, more than 4% above expectations and improving roughly 17% from the year-ago period.In addition, CAT shares could entice value-focused investors, with the current 11.9X forward earnings multiple sitting well below the 15.7X five-year median and the Zacks Industrial Products sector average.For those with an appetite for income, CAT shares have that covered as well; the company’s annual dividend presently yields a solid 2.3% with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 30% of earnings.Impressively, CAT has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, boasting an 8.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate and holding a spot within the elite Dividend Aristocrat group.Story continuesAnd to top it off, Caterpillar carries a favorable growth profile, with estimates calling for a nearly 30% jump in earnings in the current fiscal year (FY23) on 10% higher revenues.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.Additionally, the top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Caterpillar would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:Nutrien, a current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift negatively across the board over the last several months.Nutrien is a leading integrated provider of crop inputs and services, supplying growers through its leading global retail network. The company plays a vital role in helping farmers around the world sustainably increase food production.Current StandingIn its latest release, Nutrien posted weak quarterly results, falling short of earnings expectations by nearly 30% and reporting revenue 8.5% below the Zacks Consensus estimate.In fact, the company has fallen short of both earnings and revenue expectations in four consecutive quarters, with the average EPS surprise during the period sitting at -22%. The market reacted negatively to the lighter-than-expected results.Shares pay a solid dividend, currently yielding 3.8% annually and well above the Zacks Basic Materials sector average. Of course, it’s worth noting that the company’s poor share performance year-to-date has amplified the yield.NTR shares broke through the 200-day moving average in late 2022, reflecting a change in trend. Shares have been fiercely rejected in both instances they brushed up against the level.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts and weak quarterly results paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.Nutrien is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook over the last several months.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:3 Midstream Stocks to Watch Amid Energy Market VolatilityThe initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by its inherent nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to focus on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc., MPLX LP and The Williams Companies Inc.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well poised to gain, and hence investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Stocks in the SpotlightKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.MPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year.

130,716ec410-ab54-3c8c-a3ed-dce537753678,BA,2023-05-31,The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 54% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-nyse-ba-favoured-120023954.html,1685534423,STORY,['BA'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Boeing implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 47% ownership Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Boeing. See our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Boeing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Boeing's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Boeing. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of BoeingThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Boeing Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$74m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 38% stake in Boeing. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Boeing better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Boeing has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Valued at $14.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, BA will offer manufacturing, assembly and delivery of various peculiar support equipment for the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a solid four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 7.2% improvement from the previous year’s reported figure.Price Movement and Zacks RankShares of Boeing have risen 56.7% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In order to understand the benefit of more consistent use of CGP, Providence, a not-for-profit health system serving the Western US, implemented a reflex testing protocol where CGP was routinely ordered by pathologists at time of diagnosis for advanced cancer patients. The abstract, ""Improved outcomes from reflex comprehensive genomic profiling-guided precision therapeutic selection across a major US healthcare system,"" (abstract #6622) will be presented on June 3 from 1:15 to 4:15 p.m. at the ASCO Annual Meeting. It concludes: ""CGP-guided precision therapy use is associated with significantly higher survival in a reflex testing population. A reflex protocol can overcome key barriers to the use and timing of genomic testing to improve access to these life-extending treatment modalities.""Story continues""Providence is committed to conducting research aimed at enhancing our understanding of therapies' effectiveness in real-world scenarios,"" said Dr. Carlo Bifulco, chief medical officer of Providence Genomics. ""By gaining insights from this research, we strive to improve patient care and outcomes, benefiting both our patients and the broader health care industry. This study showcases the significant impact of implementing CGP testing systematically at the point of diagnosis, underscoring its potential to significantly improve survival rates in advanced stage cancer patients.""As tumor tissue is not always available for testing, another abstract reports on a collaborative study with Allegheny Health Network, a 14-hospital academic medical system serving western Pennsylvania and western New York, that revealed a high correlation of plasma circulating tumor DNA assays with values obtained from the solid tumor CGP assay. This included the identification of additional potentially actionable variants detected specifically in the plasma assay (abstract #3059). And to further clarify the value of complex biomarkers in cancer care, Illumina participated with the SEQUOIA (Sequencing and Oncology Informatics Academic) Consortium to map the landscape of tumor mutational burden across multiple cancer types in more than 10,000 patients (abstract #2615) across broad demographics.Collectively, these studies contribute to the growing evidence supporting the benefit of CGP, from tissue or liquid biopsies, for advanced cancer patients.Struggles in current standard-of-care testingIllumina will also present two posters illustrating both the gaps in current testing practices and a study indicating that a large percentage of cancer patients who are eligible for biomarker testing are not receiving any genomic testing whatsoever.Small-panel genomic assays that test for key cancer-related biomarkers remain part of routine care in oncology in some regions. Certainly, any testing is better than no testing to help guide therapy. However, a descriptive analysis of guideline-recommended biomarker inclusion in targeted NGS panels for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), found that nearly all commercially available small panels miss at least one biomarker recommended in clinical practice guidelines (abstract #3124).Of 32 commercially available NGS panels with &lt;100 genes, only 7 captured all 3 variant classes and of those, only 2 captured all 12 guideline-recommended biomarkers in advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This study highlights how the small panels are often insufficient in keeping up with the rapidly expanding number of clinically actionable biomarkers, leaving patients without access to therapies that can dramatically improve outcomes.Another poster presentation on an abstract based on research using data from a large insurance claims database, ""Real-world analysis of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage patients with advanced cancer and rates of molecular testing,"" (abstract #6633) aimed to understand the use of biomarker testing across types of cancer. It found that across tumor types, between 50% and 80% of advanced cancer patients (those eligible for biomarker testing and with clinical practice guidelines recommending testing) do not receive any kind of genomic testing. The abstract's conclusions include: ""Considering guideline recommendations, rates of biomarker testing across tumor types are far from optimal despite insurance coverage for testing.""""In aggregate, these studies underscore the promise of personalized oncology and raise awareness that many patients do not get the opportunity to benefit,"" said Febbo. ""Too many eligible patients are not receiving appropriate testing or receiving sub-optimal testing. When we fail to give every patient an opportunity to benefit from effective therapy, we fail our patients.""As the industry and the medical community continue to produce supporting evidence on the clinical efficacy and utility of CGP, it highlights the importance of clinical adoption and implementation. Kevin Keegan, general manager of Oncology at Illumina, said: ""We are committed to raising awareness among the oncology and payer communities of the real-world evidence and impact that CGP has demonstrated. We look forward to connecting with our colleagues and collaborators at ASCO to advance the mission of bringing CGP into the standard of care.""At the conference, the Illumina booth (#7307) will debut an educational game, ""Comprehensive Genomic Protector,"" for providers to practice connecting variants with targeting drugs.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

Collectively, these emissions account for about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.Southern is not the first utility whose shareholders are demanding it takes action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In April, 18.3% of CenterPoint Energy Inc.’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar resolution. Duke, Dominion, Sempra and Xcel all have announced the expansion of their net zero emission reduction targets to include the sale of natural gas to customers from their gas distribution businesses.“Southern and CenterPoint will benefit from stepping up their ambition in proactively reducing emissions reduction from their gas distribution business to match the progress they are making in their power business,” said Daniel Stewart, energy and climate program manager at As You Sow.“Without quantitative and time-bound, science-aligned targets, Southern and CenterPoint will be unprepared for the growing disruption facing the gas utility industry. Such unpreparedness increases the risk of misinformed strategy, insufficient innovation and misdirected capital expenditure on technologies that cannot scale at the level needed to achieve net zero emissions. A net zero target is the first step in addressing the climate risk they face.Don't miss:Closing the Wealth Gap: Investment Fund Delivers Impressive Returns To Its Investors And TenantsElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Nearly 31 million people in nine states and Washington, D.C., live in a jurisdiction where policies have been introduced.Both the Nasdaq Stock Market and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have issued greenhouse gas emissions guidelines for public companies. Although neither are requirements yet, 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies put out sustainability reports in 2019 — up from 20% in 2011.In 2019, Nasdaq launched its ESG Reporting Guide for public and private companies. Although Nasdaq doesn’t require listed companies to issue ESG reporting, it may track their participation.While the SEC’s proposed climate-disclosure rule is not yet effective, many companies are beginning to behave as though it is. A survey by accounting firm PwC and reporting software company Workiva Inc. found that about 70% of companies plan to comply with the SEC rule, which would require public companies to report climate-related risks and emissions data.

146,8920eb0b-6f04-393f-9d54-d6a97e1b1a83,CI,2023-05-31,CI or HUM: Which HMO Stock is Better Placed at the Moment?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ci-hum-hmo-stock-better-150600739.html,1685459160,STORY,"['HUM', 'CI']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, more commonly referred to as the Health Maintenance Organization (“HMO”) space, is aided by growing premiums and an expanding customer base within the Government business. An aging U.S. population, the active pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy and a solid financial position are other factors acting as tailwinds for the industry participants.Health insurers devise affordable health plans and foray deeper into several U.S. communities and keep upgrading these plans with lucrative features from time to time. The beneficial features of the plans continue to fetch several contract wins or renewed agreements for health insurers from the federal or state authorities.This contributes to membership growth and drives premiums, the most significant contributor to any health insurer’s top line. The demand for the Medicare plans (primarily meant for people aged 65 or above) devised by HMO industry players is also likely to stay solid in the days ahead, considering a rapidly increasing aging U.S. population.Per a report published by the Administration on Aging, which functions under an operating division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, individuals aged 65 and older witnessed a significant uptick from 40.5 million in 2010 to a decade-later figure of 55.7 million. The age group is anticipated to clock a figure of 94.7 million by 2060.The industry players rely on an active M&amp;A strategy to advance their capabilities, bring diversification benefits, broaden the customer base and strengthen their global presence. A solid financial position has provided them with a cushion to pursue these growth initiatives.In light of the ongoing digitization across every sphere of life and the amount of ease and convenience such services provide, health insurers have incurred substantial investments to devise telehealth services for extending virtual healthcare services to patients. This has generated a steady revenue stream for industry participants.Story continuesThe prevailing scenario makes us optimistic about consistent growth in the HMO industry, which should bolster the prospects of companies with sound business fundamentals.The Zacks Medical-HMO industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, has increased 1.1% in the past three months compared with the sector’s growth of 0.7%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P Index has risen 7.6% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at two HMO stocks, The Cigna Group CI and Humana Inc. HUM, with market capitalizations of $72.3 billion and $62.3 billion, respectively. Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's delve deeper into specific parameters to ascertain which company is better positioned at the moment.Price PerformanceThough shares of both companies have underperformed the industry’s growth of 1.1% in the past three months, Humana has the edge over Cigna on this front. While shares of HUM have risen 0.1% in the past three months, CI declined 15.5% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings Surprise HistoryA stock’s earnings surprise track helps investors get an idea about its performance in the previous quarters.Cigna’s bottom line beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.56%. Meanwhile, Humana’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.87%. Thus, HUM has a better reading than CI.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a profitability measure, which indicates how efficiently the company is utilizing its shareholders' funds.Humana’s ROE of 21% compares favorably with Cigna’s ROE of 12.7% but remains lower than the industry’s average of 24.8%.ValuationPrice-to-earnings (P/E) value is the best multiple used for valuing healthcare stocks. Compared with HUM’s forward 12-month P/E ratio of 16.68, CI is cheaper, with a reading of 9.31. The HMO industry’s P/E ratio is 16.98.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe lower the debt-to-equity ratio, the better for the company as it implies a sound solvency level. Humana’s leverage ratio of 69.8% remains lower than Cigna’s ratio of 73.1% and the industry’s average of 71.3%. Therefore, HUM holds an edge over CI in this case.Robust 2023 ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings indicates a year-over-year improvement of 6.5%, while the same for Humana suggests 11.9% year-over-year growth this year. Thus, Humana has the edge over Cigna here.Long-Term Growth ProjectionThe expected long-term earnings growth rate of Humana is 13.5%, which is better than Cigna’s figure of 11.2% and the industry’s average of 13.4%.VGM ScoreThe VGM Score rates each stock on its combined weighted styles, helping identify those with the most attractive value, the best growth and the most promising momentum. Both Cigna and Humana have an impressive VGM Score of A, faring equally on this front.Membership GrowthRising membership usually contributes favorably to the top line of a health insurer. Total medical customers of Cigna came in at 19.5 million as of Mar 31, 2023, while the same for Humana was reported at 17.2 million. Therefore, Cigna wins this round.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Humana is better poised than Cigna for its price performance, earnings surprise, ROE, debt-to-equity ratio, 2023 prospects and long-term growth forecast. Meanwhile, CI scores higher in terms of valuation and membership figures. With the scale tilted significantly toward Humana, the stock appears to be better poised.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Valued at $14.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, BA will offer manufacturing, assembly and delivery of various peculiar support equipment for the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a solid four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%.

LMT recently announced that its unit, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for the full-rate production of the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program’s (“SEWIP”) AN/SLQ-32(V)6 and AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 systems. The deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Valued at $67.9 million, the contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Liverpool, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The rise in security threats and the changing dynamics of the defense world have led to increased defense spending on improved surveillance and countermeasure capability against naval threats like anti-ship missiles.Backed by such demand and the need to make the electronic warfare threat detection system more prompt, SEWIP was introduced by Lockheed Martin. SEWIP was designed to provide enhanced electronic warfare capabilities to existing and new ship combat systems to improve anti-ship missile defense, counter-targeting and counter-surveillance capabilities.With the capability to conduct both littoral and open-ocean electronic surveillance, SEWIP has been in the portfolio of the electric warfare system of the U.S. Navy for many years, and its demand may continue to increase manifold in the days ahead. Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4.7% during the 2022-2027 period.The expanding market size and the advantages of the electronic warfare system offered by LMT make SEWIP an attractive option for the Navy, thereby resulting in Lockheed Martin winning orders for the same, like the latest one. These developments are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Peer ProspectsApart from Lockheed Martin, defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of additional spending on electronic warfare systems and thus witness a probable inflow of orders are as follows:Story continuesGeneral Dynamics GD has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GD’s 2023 earnings suggests an improvement of 3.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman’s NOC Block 3 SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system and provides the game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet. The advantage of this electronic attack system is that it provides a non-kinetic, soft-kill magazine to defeat inbound threats.Northrop’s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 earnings has moved upward by 2.1% in the past 60 days.L3Harris Technologies’ LHX Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on the advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize survivability and mission success. Some other products of the company are AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, the F-16 self-protection system, the AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.LHX’s long-term earnings growth rate is 2.6%.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.33%.Heading into today, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 15.96% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 5.24% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.03% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Nike as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.66 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 26.67%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.57 billion, up 2.73% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.24 per share and revenue of $50.96 billion. These totals would mark changes of -13.6% and +9.1%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher within the past month.

(NKE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-trending-stock-130008032.html,1685451608,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -16%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has lost 14%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share, indicating a change of -26.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 indicates a change of +22.9% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.57 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $50.96 billion and $54.54 billion estimates indicate +9.1% and +7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $0.79 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.55%. The EPS surprise was +51.92%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Following this approval, VLA2001 became the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive standard marketing authorization in Europe.The EC’s decision to grant approval to VLA2001 was based on positive top-line data from the pivotal phase III Cov-Compare study, which evaluated VLA2001 against AstraZeneca’s AZN COVID vaccine, AZD1222. The study achieved co-primary endpoints two weeks after the second vaccination dose. Data from this study demonstrated the superiority of VLA2001 over AstraZeneca’s AZD1222. Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine produced superior neutralizing antibody titer levels to AstraZeneca’s vaccine. VLA2001 demonstrated the same effectiveness as the AstraZeneca vaccine in neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates by more than 95%.Prior to securing the marketing approval in the EU, Valneva entered into an APA with the EC in November 2021 to supply up to 60 million doses of VLA2001 to the EU member states once the vaccine was granted marketing authorization.One of the terms of this APA provided the EC the right to terminate the agreement, if VLA2001 failed to receive marketing authorization in the EU by Apr 30, 2022. The EC decided to exercise this right in May 2022 and communicated its intent to terminate the APA. Following remediation discussions between the EC and Valneva, the former approved an amendment to the APA, revising the supply down from 60 million doses of VLA2001 to 1.25 million doses. The amended APA allows EC to purchase another 1.25 million doses.Story continuesThis reduced order received from the EC resulted in management evaluating its COVID-19 program. Management decided not to continue further investment in VLA2001-related activities unless it has secured a partnership to fund the same. Instead, the company is utilizing its resources towards developing its non-COVID pipeline candidates. The successful development and potential development of these candidates will likely boost the stock’s growth prospects in the long-run.Currently, Valneva is focused on developing vaccine candidates targeting chikungunya and Lyme disease.Valneva is developing VLA15, its vaccine candidate for Lyme disease. The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer PFE. Last year, Pfizer and Valneva initiated a phase III study to evaluate VLA15 in individuals aged five years and older.In December, Valneva and Pfizer reported six-month antibody persistence data from a phase II study in patients who completed a three-dose or a two-dose vaccination schedule of VLA15. While antibody levels in schedules remained above baseline, they were higher in participants who received the three-dose vaccination schedule. These results validate incorporating a three-dose vaccination schedule in the above-mentioned phase III study.This February, Valneva announced that the FDA accepted the BLA submission, which seeks approval to use its single-shot chikungunya vaccine, VLA1553, in adults. This filing has been granted priority review and a decision is expected by August 2023-end. If approved, VLA1553 will be the first vaccine for chikungunya and will be eligible for a priority review voucher. A similar regulatory filing for the vaccine in Europe is expected later this year.Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Price Valneva SE Sponsored ADR PriceValneva SE Sponsored ADR price | Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderValneva currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has lost 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of -68.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.1%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.34 indicates a change of -0.2% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -49.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $67.71 billion and $66.55 billion estimates indicate -32.5% and -1.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.

Kennedy Institute,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sen-joni-ernst-sen-jeanne-173900034.html,1685468340,STORY,"['FOXA', 'FOX']","[Senate Project Holds Third Event in Series on June 12BOSTON, May 30, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The third installment of The Senate Project series will feature Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in a forum moderated by FOX News Channel’s (FNC) chief political anchor Bret Baier on Monday, June 12 at 11 a.m. EDT/8 a.m. PDT from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston. The event will run live, commercial free on FOX News Media’s streaming platform, FOX Nation that day and will later air on FNC on Sunday, June 18 at 10 p.m./EDT.Utilizing the Institute’s full-scale replica of the United States Senate chambers at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the hour-long event will focus on a variety of topics, including foreign policy and homeland security.In 2022, Baier moderated The Senate Project’s inaugural debate between Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), which was live streamed on FOX Nation. As FNC’s chief political anchor and executive editor of Special Report, Baier has played a pivotal role in coverage of every major political event since joining the network in 1998. His nightly news program is routinely among the top five programs in all of cable news, averaging 2.2 million viewers year to date. Following the forum, he will anchor Special Report live from the Kennedy Institute at 6 p.m./EDT that evening.The Senate Project seeks to bring together senators from different ends of the political spectrum for civil, substantive discussion and debate aimed at finding potential areas of bipartisan compromise and common ground, a hallmark of the Senate for more than two centuries. The project and its founding partners take inspiration from the model of political bridge-building established by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and late Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, in working past party and political differences to forge consensus on landmark healthcare reform legislation and other bipartisan bills.Story continuesPrevious editions of The Senate Project debates featured Senators Lindsey O. Graham (R-SC) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the Kennedy Institute in June 2022 hosted by FOX News Media and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Rob Portman (R-OH), hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) in August 2022. A fourth Senate Project debate is being planned for September in Washington, D.C.In commenting on the announcement, FOX News Media President &amp; Executive Editor Jay Wallace said, ""Following the success of last year’s debate, we are once again pleased to partner with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation and the Edward M. Kennedy Institute. The Senate Project series is a great example of how political leaders from opposing sides can find common ground in their efforts to address the critical issues facing the nation.""""The Kennedy Institute is thrilled to host the third installment of The Senate Project in our replica Senate chamber,"" said Adam Hinds, CEO of the Kennedy Institute. ""Now more than ever, our country needs to recognize civil debate and dialogue is central to the American government process. Senators Kennedy and Hatch worked across differences to achieve monumental legislation together that changed the lives of millions of Americans. That is the example that inspired this project, and that is what this moment calls for.""""BPC is the place where democracy gets to work, and The Senate Project series embodies the ‘work’ that BPC does every day to connect lawmakers from across the political spectrum to rebuild trust and create lasting policy solutions that will improve the lives of everyday Americans,"" said Kelly Darnell, interim CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center.""The Senate Project series embodies the principles and values our late Chairman Emeritus sought to exemplify when establishing the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation,"" added Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation. ""Senator Hatch’s commitment to engaging in thought-provoking public discussions helped create the consensus necessary to pass significant bipartisan legislation. With two successful events in the books, we’re demonstrating that bipartisan discourse can cut through the noise and hyperbolic soundbites.""Among their other committee assignments, Senator Ernst is a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and is the ranking member on the Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Senator Shaheen is a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, chair of the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and chair of the Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation.About FOX News MediaFOX News Media operates the FOX News Channel (FNC), FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Digital, FOX News Audio, FOX News Books, the direct-to-consumer streaming services FOX Nation and FOX News International and the free ad-supported television service FOX Weather.

Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 2.33%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology and consulting company had gained 2.22% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.73% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.03% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from IBM as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, IBM is projected to report earnings of $1.98 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 14.29%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.49 billion, down 0.28% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.30 per share and revenue of $61.88 billion, which would represent changes of +1.86% and +2.23%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.11% higher within the past month. IBM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that IBM has a Forward P/E ratio of 13.85 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.94.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.4. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Computer - Integrated Systems stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.62 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 170, which puts it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

171,aa1216e6-74ff-3672-b229-6d2c27ff608f,MPC,2023-05-31,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-attracting-130010317.html,1685451610,STORY,['MPC'],"[Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned -11.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has lost 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $4.79 per share, indicating a change of -54.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -24% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $19.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -26.5%. This estimate has changed -13.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.01 indicates a change of -32.4% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Petroleum is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $31.9 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -41.2%. The $135.84 billion and $123.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -24.5% and -9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 8% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. This indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.For those interested in the sector, we have earmarked three stocks — Murphy USA MUSA, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX — all sporting solid fundamental and valuation profiles.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Murphy USA: This is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA’s acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Murphy USA shares have found buyers over the last month, climbing 2% in value and outperforming the S&amp;P 500 modestly. The company’s latest earnings results were solid too. MUSA posted earnings of $4.80 per share, 18% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS). Meanwhile, quarterly revenues of Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Murphy USA totaled $5.1 billion, slightly above expectations.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Importantly, the company’s shares looks reasonable regarding valuation, with the current forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.28 sitting just above the five-year median and well below the Zacks that Oil – Energy sector average.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinally, MUSA remains committed to returning excess cash to its shareholders through continued share buyback programs. As part of this initiative, the fuel retailer recently approved a repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion following the completion of the existing $1 billion mandate.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to the lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).MPC reported last on May 2, and results came in above expectations. The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS by more than 6%. Quarterly revenues totaled $35.1 billion, $2.6 billion above estimates. Analysts have become bullish on the company’s current year, with the annual EPS estimate being revised nearly 2% higher in the past week.MPC, which has a VGM Score of A, also remains committed to returning excess cash flow. The company repurchased $3.2 billion of shares and a further $1.2 billion worth of shares in April. Moreover, Marathon Petroleum gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval and currently has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.In particular, shares could entice value-focused investors, with the current 5.66X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 10.21X five-year median and Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.Phillips 66’ adjusted first-quarter earnings more than tripled year over year to $4.21 a share, blowing by the consensus EPS estimates by 18%. The #3 Ranked company has now topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS by an average of 13.5% in the trailing four quarters.Investors should also be pleased to know that its 4.43% dividend yield comfortably tops the S&amp;P 500’s 1.51%. Meanwhile, PSX enjoys a VGM Composite Score of A.Phillips 66’ valuation levels are looking attractive at the moment. It is trading at a 47% discount to its five-year median and a roughly 16% discount to the Zacks Oil-Energy sector at just 6.61X forward 12-month earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Tesla says it has roughly 45,000 Supercharger connectors across the globe at 4,947 Supercharger Stations. Moreover, Ford's next generation of EVs which should arrive by 2025 will be able to use these superchargers without needing an adapter.The Changing Industry NormThe current industry norm is the CCS charger, while Tesla vehicles and its Supercharger network use NACS. The charging infrastructure is considered crucial to global EV adoption. Yet, Stellantis, GM and other automakers don’t have access to as many fast chargers as only Tesla has successfully built its own charging network with its charges ranking best for overall customer satisfaction last year, according to a survey from J.D. Power. Not to mention the fact that according to another study from the same source, at least 1 in 5 charging attempts overall failed in 2022, giving Tesla an even greater lead on the charging front. It is important to note that electric vehicles from Stellantis and General Motors, as well as others, can still use Tesla's superchargers, but through Tesla's specific adapter.Story continuesTesla’s Long GameDuring the Twitter chat, Musk said that by collaborating with Ford, and perhaps others, customers will be better off its NACS becomes the standard. It seems that General Motors, Stellantis and others have been given the invitation to join Tesla's supercharging network. Ford’s New SUVLast week during its “Delivering Ford+” day, Ford also unveiled details about its upcoming three-row electric SUV revealing it will be similar in size to the Expedition, with a fast-charging ability of 150 miles of range in less than 10 minutes, with a total range of 350 miles per charge.LithiumBefore the event, Ford already revealed it signed multiple deals to secure a supply of lithium battery materials.Ford Continues Pursuing Its Ambitious GoalsFord continues its race towards producing 2 million EV units by the end oTesla to export to Canada from Shanghaif 2026, jumping even more compared to its targeted 600,000 produced units by the end of this year.Also last week, Tesla's website delighted its Canadian fans, confirming the export of China-made Model 3 and Model Y. With this move, Tesla can maintain the supply of EVs manufactured in the U.S., namely California and Texas, for the U.S. market where they are eligible for tax incentives that add up to $7,500 in savings.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

But last week the big-box chain removed Carnell's products, citing an increase in confrontations between customers and employees and incidents of Pride merchandise being thrown on the floor.Some conservative news outlets and Republican politicians labelled Carnell and his designs - which are printed on pins, stickers and T-shirts - ""Satanic"" and falsely claimed his products in Target were marketed to children.Criticism for carrying Pride-related products has since begun to dog department store chain Kohl's Corp as well.Companies like Target that launch products and campaigns for Pride Month seek to profit from LGBTQ people but fail to stand by them when challenges arise, London-based Carnell said in an interview.""It's a very dangerous precedent to set, that if people just get riled up enough about the products that you're selling, you can completely distance yourself from the LGBT community, when and if it's convenient,"" said Carnell, a transgender gay man who launched his brand Abprallen in 2017.""If you're going to take a stance and say that you care about the LGBT community, you need to stand by that regardless.""Target's decision to remove some Pride products came weeks after brewer Anheuser-Busch's partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney triggered transphobic comments on social media and a boycott by some drinkers.Kohl's is also taking heat from some conservative commentators criticising it for selling bibs and bodysuits for babies that feature the Pride flag and slogans supporting the LGBTQ community. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond for a request for comment.Story continuesTarget's collection for Pride Month, which is celebrated every year in June, includes more than 2,000 products, including Carnell's Abprallen brand. His brand's products are the only ones so far that have been removed both in-store and online, he said.Carnell says he has received hate messages and death threats over the past week, adding that he has had no contact from Target.Target on Tuesday said it did not have any new comment on the matter.In a statement to Reuters last week, the company said that due to ""volatile circumstances"" in its stores, it was removing items at the center of the ""most significant confrontational behavior.""In a May 24 memo to Target employees, which was obtained by Business Insider, Target CEO Brian Cornell said ""one of the hardest parts"" of its move to pull the merchandise was figuring out how that would impact the ""wellbeing and psychological safety"" of the LGBTQ community.""We stand with you now and will continue to do so - not just during Pride Month, but each and every day,"" he said.The designer Carnell said Etsy, an online marketplace where Abprallen has a store, got in touch to check on him, and that Threadless, which prints his designs, offered him its premium services for free.The backlash targeted Abprallen products that were not sold at Target, such as a design featuring the slogan ""Satan Respects Pronouns"" and a horned ram representing Baphomet - a half-human, half-animal deity that is both male and female.Commentators falsely claimed that this design was being sold at Target.(Reporting by Helen Reid in London, Additional reporting by Siddharth Cavale and Kate Masters in New York; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Deepa Babington)]"

Shareholders, and various other guests, are also expected to hear about the company investing heavily in new automation, the opening recently of its first Arkansas market fulfillment center, and progress on new ventures like the retailer's ad business, called Walmart Connect.There's lots of good news to talk about. Earlier this month, the retail giant posted first quarter same-store sales growth that beat expectations and raised its full-year earnings per share forecast to a range of $6.10-$6.20 per share, up from its prior expectations for earnings to come in at $5.95-$6.05 per share in its fiscal year. (Not all news is great: Shares of Walmart are up 3% compared to a year ago but lower than the S&amp;P 500, which is up 9.4%.)UBS analyst Michael Lasser, who has a Buy rating on shares of Walmart and a price target of $173, expects this week's meeting to have a ""bullish tone,"" no different than the commentary from the recent call with investors.If you plan on being in northwest Arkansas for the meeting and associated events this week, here's what to expect:Automation updates: Back in early April, at Walmart's investor meeting, the company said that by the end of fiscal year 2026, it aims to have 65% of its stores be serviced by the likes of AI digital assistants such as 'Ask Sam,' which is featured at its Sam's Club. That includes robots that scan inventory. It also aims to have approximately 55% of the fulfillment center volume move through automated facilities.Story continuesSeth Sigman, who has an Overweight rating and a $162 price target on shares said, ""The focus on productivity and automation... that's really more about building a muscle to create a more profitable business model to invest"" as the retailer looks to enhance its in-store shopping experience.An inside look at the market fulfillment center: As Walmart aims to take on Amazon (AMZN), the company will offer an inside look at its new fulfillment center located in Arkansas, which is attached to a store. This is Walmart's second-ever fulfillment center and its first in Arkansas (the first one was in Salem, New Hampshire), and Walmart plans to open more in select stores in the coming years.Fulfillment centers typically serve as a hub to get a product from a seller to the customer. These operations completely handle things like order pickup, package and delivery—unlike a distribution center which either sends the product to another location or directly to the consumer.The fulfillment center is intended to boost the customer experience ""through quicker, more accurate online order fulfillment,"" the company has said. These centers are expected to increase the number of orders a store can fulfill that day and decrease the number of times a product goes out of stock.The opportunity to see the new fulfillment center in action, ""will really bring a lot of this automation to life,"" Lasser said to Yahoo Finance.Walmart Opens First Market Fulfillment Center in Arkansas as the Retailer Doubles Down on Store Fulfillment (Courtesy: Walmart)Alternative businesses: Analysts are keeping score on how some recent major investments are performing like Walmart Connect, Walmart+, and Walmart Marketplace.Walmart Connect is the retailer's advertising business that is intended to serve advertisers an in-store, online, and omnichannel experience to accelerate growth for their company.Meanwhile, Walmart+ is a membership-based subscription model that costs $12.95 per month after a free 30-day trial. Perks include a Paramount+ subscription (PARA), free delivery from the store, free shipping with no order minimum, member savings on fuel, and return pickups from members' homes, among others.D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker said this is the ""big story"" for the retailer. He added: ""They've been investing in all these new businesses, these alternative businesses,"" and now are finally seeing returns.D.A. Davidson has a Buy rating on shares and a $178.07 price target.Culture wars? Thursday, June 1, kicks off Pride Month and one of Walmart's biggest competitors Target (TGT) and others including Kohl's (KSS) are facing boycotts over pride-themed merchandise. Will Walmart and its executives weigh in?Rock &amp; Roll: Some analysts — well, maybe most of them — are also looking forward to the all-day associate celebration on Friday, June 2, which typically features entertainment from A-List celebrities alongside messages from senior leadership. Previous celebrity guests included James Corden, Jennifer Garner, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Timberlake, and even Taylor Swift back in 2012.Any guesses on who it will be this year?—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Ross Stores investors that purchase the stock on or after the 5th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.34 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.34 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Ross Stores has a trailing yield of approximately 1.3% on its current stock price of $103.26. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Ross Stores paying out a modest 28% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ross Stores generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 24% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's positive to see that Ross Stores's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Ross Stores earnings per share are up 4.8% per annum over the last five years. Recent growth has not been impressive. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Ross Stores has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Ross Stores worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Ross Stores is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Ross Stores is halfway there. Ross Stores looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.So while Ross Stores looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Ross Stores that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

""It takes a lot of supplies, a lot of hard work and dedication, a lot of people to do this.""This includes weddings, proms, birthday parties, corporate events and even educational workshops like the Inner City Capital Connections training Regions Bank brought to Houston for more than 50 under-resourced entrepreneurs in late 2022.

(HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores says consumers and businesses are poised to see big changes to their computers within 24 months due to new advances in artificial intelligence.""What we are working on is to build AI capabilities into the PC,"" Lores told analysts on a late Tuesday earnings call. ""So, consumers or professionals will be able to run AI applications at the edge and will not have to run them on the cloud.""""The benefit this will bring is that if you're a small company and you want to use some of your private data in an AI application, you will not have to upload it, you will be able to run it locally.

Customers will start seeing some of these solutions available in 2024 about 12 months, 20 months from now, and it's going to be a huge opportunity to really bring energy to the category,"" Lores explained.A heavy dose of energy is badly needed in the computing market.HP saw unit sales under pressure in its PC and printing segments in the most recent quarter as businesses and consumers continued to closely manage their finances after the pandemic.Fiscal second quarter net sales plunged 21.7% from the prior year to $12.9 billion, just shy of estimates for $13.03 billion. Sales in the personal systems (PCs) segment tanked 29% from the year-ago period, missing analyst estimates by about $200 million. Printing sales fell 5% year over year.With HP's various cost-cutting efforts over the past year, margins in both businesses managed to stay intact.HP shares dipped by about 5% in pre-market trading on Wednesday as investors locked in on the unit declines in PCs amid a softening economy.But going somewhat overlooked is the potential for the first half of 2023 to mark the bottom for PC makers like HP.Story continuesPALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 23: A sign is posted in front of a Hewlett Packard (HP) office on November 23, 2022 in Palo Alto, California.

Full-year shipments in 2024 are forecasted to be 13% higher than in 2023.Wall Street sees this refresh cycle as an inevitable earnings tailwind for HP.""We view management’s commentary on the earnings call around much lower inventory levels to work down as well as a seasonal rebound in PC volumes led by consumer demand as largely in line with our own checks, and expect the seasonal upside to follow as long as there is no further deterioration in the macro- economy,"" said JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a research note.Chatterjee added: ""Further driving our confidence in the volume projections are the higher installed base of PC volumes and robust replacement cycle with priority given to high-end features on PCs.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

To determine the ranking, Statista surveyed approximately 45,000 U.S. employees for companies with a minimum of 1,000 employees. The evaluation was based on  criteria including:Direct recommendations: Employees were asked to give their opinions on a series of statements regarding age, gender, ethnicity, disability, LGBTQA+ and general diversity in their current workplace. The recommendations of women, elders, and ethnic minorities were weighted higher than the non-minority groups.Indirect Recommendations: Participants were also given the chance to evaluate other employers in their respective industries that stand out either positively or negatively with regard to diversity. Only the recommendations of minority groups were considered.Key Performance Indicators: Extensive research was carried out to evaluate how companies fared across a range of diversity-related best-practices. These included the presence of resource groups within the company, the publication of diversity data, and the share of women in board and executive positions.Story continuesAir Products' inclusion on the Forbes Best Employers for Diversity list is the latest recognition for its efforts to build the most diverse industrial gas company workforce in the world.

Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston. The event will run live, commercial free on FOX News Media’s streaming platform, FOX Nation that day and will later air on FNC on Sunday, June 18 at 10 p.m./EDT.Utilizing the Institute’s full-scale replica of the United States Senate chambers at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the hour-long event will focus on a variety of topics, including foreign policy and homeland security.In 2022, Baier moderated The Senate Project’s inaugural debate between Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT), which was live streamed on FOX Nation. As FNC’s chief political anchor and executive editor of Special Report, Baier has played a pivotal role in coverage of every major political event since joining the network in 1998. His nightly news program is routinely among the top five programs in all of cable news, averaging 2.2 million viewers year to date. Following the forum, he will anchor Special Report live from the Kennedy Institute at 6 p.m./EDT that evening.The Senate Project seeks to bring together senators from different ends of the political spectrum for civil, substantive discussion and debate aimed at finding potential areas of bipartisan compromise and common ground, a hallmark of the Senate for more than two centuries. The project and its founding partners take inspiration from the model of political bridge-building established by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and late Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, in working past party and political differences to forge consensus on landmark healthcare reform legislation and other bipartisan bills.Story continuesPrevious editions of The Senate Project debates featured Senators Lindsey O. Graham (R-SC) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at the Kennedy Institute in June 2022 hosted by FOX News Media and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Rob Portman (R-OH), hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) in August 2022. A fourth Senate Project debate is being planned for September in Washington, D.C.In commenting on the announcement, FOX News Media President &amp; Executive Editor Jay Wallace said, ""Following the success of last year’s debate, we are once again pleased to partner with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation and the Edward M. Kennedy Institute. The Senate Project series is a great example of how political leaders from opposing sides can find common ground in their efforts to address the critical issues facing the nation.""""The Kennedy Institute is thrilled to host the third installment of The Senate Project in our replica Senate chamber,"" said Adam Hinds, CEO of the Kennedy Institute. ""Now more than ever, our country needs to recognize civil debate and dialogue is central to the American government process. Senators Kennedy and Hatch worked across differences to achieve monumental legislation together that changed the lives of millions of Americans. That is the example that inspired this project, and that is what this moment calls for.""""BPC is the place where democracy gets to work, and The Senate Project series embodies the ‘work’ that BPC does every day to connect lawmakers from across the political spectrum to rebuild trust and create lasting policy solutions that will improve the lives of everyday Americans,"" said Kelly Darnell, interim CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center.""The Senate Project series embodies the principles and values our late Chairman Emeritus sought to exemplify when establishing the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation,"" added Matt Sandgren, Executive Director of the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation. ""Senator Hatch’s commitment to engaging in thought-provoking public discussions helped create the consensus necessary to pass significant bipartisan legislation. With two successful events in the books, we’re demonstrating that bipartisan discourse can cut through the noise and hyperbolic soundbites.""Among their other committee assignments, Senator Ernst is a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and is the ranking member on the Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Senator Shaheen is a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, chair of the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, and chair of the Committee on Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation.About FOX News MediaFOX News Media operates the FOX News Channel (FNC), FOX Business Network (FBN), FOX News Digital, FOX News Audio, FOX News Books, the direct-to-consumer streaming services FOX Nation and FOX News International and the free ad-supported television service FOX Weather.

The deal allows Ford to access more than 12,000 Tesla V3 superchargers in North America in 2024. Ford's adoption of Tesla's exclusive charging standard represents a momentous achievement, positioning Ford as the foremost major automaker to embrace this technology. Through this collaboration, Ford gains access to the expansive network of high-speed Superchargers in the United States, enhancing convenience and charging possibilities for their electric vehicle (EV) customers.Leading truck engine maker, Cummins CMI also hit the headlines with its plans to acquire Faurecia's commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities and related activities in Roermond and Columbus for EUR142 million. Meanwhile, Cummins' spinoff Atmus made a strong market debut. Auto parts retailer AutoZone AZO reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with earnings beating estimates but sales missing the mark.American Italian automaker Stellantis STLA made news with investment in Lyten's breakthrough Lithium-Sulfur EV battery tech. By partnering with Lyten, Stellantis is poised to drive clean, safe, and affordable mobility while contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The combination of Lyten's innovative Lithium-Sulfur battery technology and Stellantis' expertise in the automotive industry sets the stage for a promising future in sustainable mobility.Last Week’s Key Stories1. Ford laid out its plan to profitably ramp up its EV production while parallelly growing its traditional operations. The company maintained its previous guidance of adjusted EBIT in the range of $9-$11 billion and adjusted free cash flow of around $6 billion in 2023. The auto giant targets an 8% EBIT margin on its EV units and expects to produce 2 million EVs annually by 2026.Ford has partnered with three lithium makers: Albermarle, SQM and Nemaska Lithium, from whom it is likely to have secured 90% of the required amount of lithium and nickel.As soon as BlueOval SK starts its operations in 2026, Ford suggests offering the cheapest electric vehicle batteries in the United States.Story continuesIn other news, Fordis recalling more than 175,000 Bronco models from 2021 to 2023 due to a fault in the seatbelt latch. Per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) notice, the seatbelt latch might be difficult to access and could potentially compromise the passenger’s safety. A free fix will be available at Ford dealerships to address the issue.

Per the agreement, Ford users will get access to over 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the United States and Canada starting early next year. Ford’s existing owners will be able to charge their electric vehicles at Tesla Superchargers using an adapter, whereas its next-generation EV owners will not need an adapter to charge their vehicles at Superchargers. Ford’s CEO Farley mentioned that the legacy automaker is committed to using a single U.S. charging protocol that includes Tesla’s charger port, called the North American Charging Standard.2.Cummins signed a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement with Faurecia, a French global automotive supplier and a FORVIA Group Company, to acquire two of the latter’s commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities and related activities.

That's just shy of the $120 million forecast, but still a solid start to the summer box office season and the fifth-highest total for any Memorial Day weekend ever.International results lagged with the film earning just $68.1 million from more than 51 markets overseas.The film's early domestic success represents a cautious win for Disney, which has struggled to secure serious gains at the box office outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""Little Mermaid"" will have to continue to perform well in the coming weeks in order to hit its break-even point of $250 million.Last summer, Pixar's ""Toy Story"" prequel ""Lightyear"" fell short of expectations, securing just $51 million in its domestic debut before going on to gross a mere $118 million in theaters ahead of an expedited Disney+ release.More recently, the animated film ""Strange World,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Dennis Quad cost the company a reported $200 million after it opened to dismal reviews during Thanksgiving week, marking one of the worst flops of 2022.Industry watchers blamed the misses on poor marketing plans and audience confusion over which titles were theatrical exclusives and which were streaming-only releases on the company's Disney+ platform.Others have suggested an overall animation slowdown, although the strong performances of competitor titles debunks that theory with Universal's (CMCSA) ""Minions: The Rise of Gru"" and ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" crushing expectations.'The Little Mermaid' (Courtesy: Disney)Disney CEO Bob Iger referenced ""The Super Mario Bros."" during the company's latest earnings call, suggesting more upside to its own theatrical business.""Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of ‘Super Mario Bros.'"" Iger said on the call. ""It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theaters around the world, and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business.""Story continuesStill, Disney has said it will be more strategic when it comes to the content it produces — particularly the content that lives on Disney+, which saw streaming losses narrow in the latest quarter despite a miss on subscriber net additions.""We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation,"" CFO Christine McCarthy said on the call, adding, ""Going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.""Iger added the company will be ""much more surgical about what we make"" and that high-performing theatrical tentpoles like ""The Little Mermaid"" could serve as a catalyst for future subscriber growth.""This is part of the maturation process,"" the executive said. ""As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service and what it is consumers want.""Disney has reiterated plans to slash $5.5 billion in costs, which will include $3 billion in content costs. The company confirmed it will take a content impairment charge between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion following the removal of multiple series and specials from both Disney+ and Hulu.Several titles, including Disney+’s ""Willow,"" ""Big Shot"" and ""The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,"" along with Hulu’s ""Dollface"" and ""Y: The Last Man,"" were reportedly removed from their respective services on May 26.The move comes amid larger cost cuts and restructuring plans after the media giant previously announced the effort to slash 7,000 jobs in February. The company went through its first round of layoffs at the end of March. Its second and largest round occurred in late April with a third round occurring last week.Disney's stock is down about 20% compared to this point last year.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The likes, the like, the likes of Fast X and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Three ultimately lost out, to Disney's live action remake of The Little Mermaid, which saw $117 million domestic opening. Here with us now is Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal to tell us more about it. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachel. And that's right, the live action, Disney Little Mermaid, soaring to more than $117 million in that four-day opening weekend estimate, according to Disney. Now, that's just shy of the $120 million forecast, but still a very strong start to the summer box office season. And we could see that number tick higher to around $119 million. We'll have to see when the final results trickle in there.But when we think about this movie, it's interesting because Disney poured a ton of money into the marketing for it. An $80 million marketing campaign that featured live performances, social media videos, viral TikTok trends. And I'm sure didn't hurt that the chatter online about this film, whether good or bad, probably convinced people who were on the fence to go out and see this movie.Now, overall at the box office, year to date through Sunday, ticket sales have climbed to just over $3.3 billion. That's nearly 30% ahead of 2022 levels, according to Comscore. And the momentum, it's only going to pick up from here with major films like Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones, Oppenheimer, the new Barbie movie, all expected to make a giant splash similar to the Little Mermaid, no pun intended.Of course, a big question for analysts is which film will be the film of the summer. Last year, that was clearly Top Gun Maverick. And this year when I asked analysts, they're not really able to give me a firm answer there, because there are just so many movies from the Giant Tentpoles, to some of those buzzing new, newcomers as well, that I think it's going to be a very competitive summer box office season.Story continues- We're definitely much more spoiled for choice this year than we were last year. I still am going to see Little Mermaid, I'm getting around to that. But my other big favorite that I've been just excited about ever since I knew it was coming, was the Barbie movie. Talk about the expectations there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh my gosh. Well, this Barbie movie, I mean, so many people have talked about it. When the trailer dropped it was going viral on Twitter. Now, it's interesting because we did receive a new note from Stifel which estimated the movie could bring in $400 million at the box office. That's up from previous estimates of $325 million. In terms of that opening weekend number, studios are looking at around $31 million. So anything above that would be considered a huge win there.But overall, there seems to be a lot of upside potential, not just at the box office, but Stifel argued for Mattel, considering Barbie is one of the most cherished brands at the company. So I think that's definitely one to watch. I'm excited for it. No one really knows the plot, but we have some really big a-list names in there, and I think that always gets people excited.- True. And that hot pink merch, you're already seeing it everywhere, so I can't wait. Allie Canal, thank you so much.]"

A solid liquidity position indicates that the bank’s capital deployments are sustainable.However, mounting expenses are expected to continue hurting M&amp;T Bank’s bottom-line growth. Significant exposure to commercial real estate loans and worsening credit quality are other woes.The bank’s focus on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise, along with the acquisition of People’s United in April 2022, which increased M&amp;T Bank’s loans by $36 billion and deposits by $53 billion, have fortified its balance sheet strength. Encouragingly, management expects average loan and lease balances to be up 10-12% this year.NII (tax equivalent basis) witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% over the six years (2017-2022). The rising trend continued in first-quarter 2023. A solid increase in NII in the upcoming quarters is expected on the decent lending scenario and high interest rates. Per our estimates, net interest income (NII) (FTE) is estimated to rise 20.3% in 2023.This, along with fee income growth in the upcoming quarters, will propel the top-line rise.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s total debt of $14.45 billion was significantly lower than its cash and due from banks, and interest-bearing deposits at banks of $24.12 billion. Therefore, the company seems well-positioned in terms of its liquidity profile and is likely to be able to continue meeting debt obligations in the near term if the economic situation worsens.This also supports the company’s capital deployment activities. It repurchased 3.8 million shares in first-quarter 2023 for $600 million, and had $1.2 billion of remaining authorization. While share repurchase activity for the second quarter is expected to decline sequentially, the company continues to pay quarterly dividends, which were sequentially hiked by 8.3% in February 2023. Such moves are expected to drive shareholder value in the upcoming period.Story continuesWith continuously rising non-interest operating expenses, M&amp;T Bank is exposed to operational risks. Expenses witnessed a CAGR of 10% over the last six years (2017-2022). The rising trend continued in first-quarter 2023. We expect the metric to increase 5.1% in 2023.Deteriorating credit quality has been a major headwind for M&amp;T Bank. While the company recorded a recapture of provision for credit losses in 2021, it built substantial reserves over the past few years and in first-quarter 2023. Non-performing assets also disappointed, with a five-year CAGR (ended 2022) of 20.6%. The rising trend continued in first-quarter 2023. Given the concerns of an economic slowdown/recession, a worsening credit quality can be concerning.Lastly, with 66.8% of the loan portfolio concentrated in commercial and commercial real estate loans, the company is exposed to asset quality deterioration amid a challenging economy.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 26.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 14.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Banks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Bar Harbor Bankshares BHB and Pathward Financial Inc. CASH, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s cloud optimization solutions help organizations to improve performance, increase availability and enhance the security of applications and key web assets delivered from data centers to the end user.The buyout of Linode, a leading Infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider, has leapfrogged it as one of the world’s most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge.

With the rapid adoption of cloud computing, security has become a major concern for enterprises. Hackers are using new and sophisticated techniques to take advantage of the security loopholes of the cloud. Large enterprises are expected to increase their security budgets to efficiently address security concerns and instill confidence in cloud computing. The growing demand for Akamai’s security solutions will likely translate into significant growth opportunities over the long term.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:6.3% = US$5.2b ÷ US$83b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Comcast has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Media industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Comcast visit our risks dashboard for free.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesComcast's Debt And Its 6.3% ROEComcast clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.21. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

As the Vice President of Veteran and Military Affairs, a military spouse, and a mother of a U.S. Army soldier, I believe service matters, and I'm passionate about building a future of unlimited possibilities for veterans, service members, and their families.Beginning with our founder Ralph Roberts, a World War II Navy veteran, many of our influential teammates proudly call themselves veterans, Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, or Coast Guardsmen. We value the entrepreneurial spirit, integrity, and esprit de corps these individuals bring to our organization, and we work year-round to create an empowering and inclusive workplace for all.In 2015, we launched our Military Engagement initiative to make Comcast NBCUniversal the employer and service provider of choice among veterans, service members, and their families. And today, as we continue to evolve and grow our deep connection and commitment to the military community remain at the core of our mission and values.Military Hiring &amp; InclusivityIn the past seven years, we have hired nearly 21,000 military-connected employees and have been continually recognized as a top employer by the Department of Defense, Military Times, Military Friendly®, DiversityInc, and VETS Indexes.21K - Military-connected employees hired by ComcastWe recognize the exceptional qualities that our military-connected teammates bring to the workforce. Their leadership skills, work ethic, and ability to adapt to change are invaluable traits that we actively seek in our employees. For this reason, we have implemented specialized training programs for our recruiters and hiring managers to better understand the unique aspects of military experience and identify transferable skills. This ensures our hiring process is aligned with the needs of military-connected job seekers and that we can provide tailored career opportunities.Story continuesWe foster the professional growth of our military-connected teammates. We have implemented unique employee benefits and experiences for those serving in the National Guard and reserve, including our best-in-class Military Concierge, so they can effectively balance and grow in both their civilian and military careers.

That's why we are installing more free WiFi-connected Lift Zones and providing access to digital skills training in community centers nationwide. In the last year, we've helped bridge the digital divide for military community members in Houston, Pittsburgh, Washington, and Baltimore. These efforts are part of Project UP, Comcast's 10-year, $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity.Since 2011, Comcast NBCUniversal has donated over $197 million to military community-serving organizations. We've had the privilege of supporting hundreds of national and local organizations serving transitioning service members, disabled veterans and military caregivers, women veterans, military spouses, and the children of service members.$197M - Donated by Comcast NBCUniversal to military community-serving organizationsLooking AheadBut those are just a few examples of how our connection to the military community has positively influenced our company culture and focus.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.15%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2.33%.Heading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 9.71% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 9.73% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.03% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Oracle as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Oracle is projected to report earnings of $1.58 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 2.6%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.74 billion, up 16.04% from the year-ago period.ORCL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.04 per share and revenue of $49.86 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +2.86% and +17.47%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Oracle should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Oracle is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Oracle has a Forward P/E ratio of 20.66 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.29.Story continuesWe can also see that ORCL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.58.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session.

Also, growing emerging markets and robust online video creation demand are contributing well to its business performance.This software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.8%. Revenues are expected to be $4.76 billion, up 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Adobe, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

There were round-the-clock negotiations and much grandstanding, but no agreement was being reported while the June 1 deadline was approaching. However, towards the end of the week, the attitudes of both sides mellowed, and indications emerged that an agreement had possibly been reached. Along with economic data suggesting that the economy is still staving off a recession, this ensured that the market did not close a losing week.The PCE inflation numbers have, however, kept investors jittery. A still-high headline PCE means the Federal Reserve might rethink its strategy and keep hiking interest rates.

BrandsYum! Brands, Tuesday, May 30, 2023, Press release pictureTaco Bell BlogAt Taco Bell, we empower our teams to be fearless, embrace difference and drive change. We believe that each one of us has a story to tell.The month of May celebrates Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. This month was specifically chosen to honor the first known Japanese immigrant to the U.S. (May 1843), as well as to acknowledge the tremendous contribution Chinese immigrants made in completing the transcontinental railroad (May 1869).AANHPI is a wide-ranging term used to describe all cultures across the continent of Asia and the Pacific Islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia - representing approximately 50 ethnic groups and 100 languages. There is incredible depth and richness of diversity found within the AANHPI community, and this month is devoted to recognizing and elevating their cultural influence.To honor and celebrate this month and the AANHPI community at The Bell, we will share their stories every week in the month of May in hopes that they not only educate but inspire you to drive positive and intentional impact within your community.Throughout the year, we will continue sharing the incredible stories of our Taco Bell teams; the sharing and celebration doesn't stop here.Pragna P. - Area Coach, Taco Bell CorpPragna had always strived to pursue her dreams, and in 2010, she began her search for a job in hopes of achieving success - wherever she went. While her search was difficult, Pragna overcame these obstacles and eventually produced a flourishing career.But how did it happen? Well, through countless job applications, she got an interview at her local Taco Bell. The Restaurant General Manager (RGM) at the time, Bryon, as well as her other mentor, Parabhjeet, saw something in Pragna, that she herself had yet to discover, and encouraged her to demonstrate this passion and perseverance in her new role. It wasn't easy for Pragna to lean in, but once she did, she too saw what they saw in her and was grateful for the guidance and trust they provided.Story continuesThrough their guidance and Pragna's skills, she was able to become an Area Coach and support a larger team than she could have ever imagined. There is no doubt that she has made her mentors proud - by not only climbing up the ladder, but also utilizing the lessons Bryon and Parabhjeet taught her. ""I always wanted to be as successful as my mentors, so I followed in their footsteps. I am where I am today because I had good mentors and I was ready to work,"" she said.Being a good mentor and having a great work ethic is only one side of the coin. Coming from a large family, Pragna knew how different every single one of us can be. Each one of her family members or friends is different in personality, has experienced different things - the list goes on - and that's where the other side of being a leader comes in. Early on, she was able to learn to adapt to different situations. This knowledge allowed her to be open-minded to everyone she meets and learn from them.So, for her, a month like AANHPI Heritage Month is a time to take stock of what you've learned, learn some more, and celebrate diverse communities and all their differences.""I have a great appreciation for diversity and respect for every individual,"" she said. ""As a woman of color, I can encourage others to do the same... one of the ways we can do this today is supporting the Taco Bell Foundation where the goal is to provide more opportunities especially for [young people].""After 13 years at The Bell®, Pragna can proudly say that she works at a place where she feels like she's part of a community that accepts and celebrates her culture and can freely interact with people from different backgrounds. And that's why equality is something that Pragna practices every day - she knows that her team and peers need to have a safe space where they can be themselves, and that's Taco Bell.As a leader, she wants her team to freely express their culture, feel like they belong and are motivated day-in and day-out. She believes that this is why she is successful today and wants to, ""... motivate others within the organization and remind them that perseverance is the key to success."" And if you keep your eye on the ball, persevere and lean into all that Taco Bell has to offer, you too can achieve your dreams - just like Pragna.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum!

In a survey of more than 2,400 professionals in the U.S., 38% of respondents reported being more burned out now than a year ago. Workers said the top factors contributing to burnout today are:Research from Robert Half reveals top steps managers have taken to address burnout.Heavy workloads (56%)Lack of communication and support from management (32%)Insufficient tools and resources to perform effectively (27%)Those with the highest burnout levels include:Millennials (27- to-42-year-olds)Working parentsEmployees who have been with their company for 2-4 yearsView infographics of the research highlights.""Despite employers' efforts to better support employee well-being, burnout is an issue that needs ongoing attention,"" said Paul McDonald, senior executive director of Robert Half. ""Compounding the matter, businesses are moving forward with an influx of new projects, putting more pressure on current staff who may already be stretched thin.""Combating Burnout CultureThe research shows more must be done to promote a healthy workplace culture. Nearly four in 10 professionals (37%) feel uneasy about expressing feelings of burnout with their boss. Further, one in five workers said their manager hasn't taken steps to help them alleviate work-related stress. Those who are receiving support have been:Encouraged to take time off (26%)Provided greater schedule flexibility (24%)Given guidance on prioritizing projects (22%)Foregoing Summer FunWork breaks are essential for restoring energy and focus and preventing burnout.

Another 21% of employees will be checking in with work frequently when on vacation.Story continuesMcDonald noted, ""Refreshed and recharged workers are happier, more productive and less likely to burn out. To discourage hustle culture and find better balance, managers must set clear and realistic expectations, and workers need to prioritize self-care and protect their personal time.

Shares of LI are higher by 38% year-to-date, while the Zacks Automotive – Foreign peer group is lower by 7.5%.Meanwhile, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF is lower by 5% year-to-date, and other EV makers, such as LI competitor Nio, are lower by 21%. Most traditional auto manufacturers like GM are lagging versus LI and are flat year-to-date.Fundamental PictureOver the past two quarters, LI has produced robust top and bottom-line growth. Last quarter, EPS grew 163% while revenue grew 81%, year-over-year. Li Auto also has a history of topping consensus estimates. LI has produced positive earnings surprises in six of the past six quarters. (Last quarter, earnings surprised by a healthy 121%).While it’s nice to have strong current earnings and a strong earnings’ track record, future earnings are where “the rubber meets the road.” Because of Li’s strong expected earnings estimates moving forward, the company earns the coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Only 5% of stocks in the entire market earn this rating. For full-year 2023, Zacks Consensus Estimates predict that Li’s EPS will rocket by 2,400% year-over-year.Industry GroupAs I mentioned earlier, LI is among the strongest stock in its industry group. However, that does not mean we should discount industry group strength. Studies have shown that roughly half of a stock’s price movement can be attributed to the underlying industry group. The Automotive – Foreign Industry is ranked 31 out of 250 groups tracked by Zacks (top 12%).Story continuesTechnical ViewLi is showing a lot of strength from a technical perspective. The stock is outperforming on a relative basis, forming a bull flag pattern, and just triggered a bullish “golden cross” earlier this month.ConclusionStrong fundamentals, relative performance, and price action suggest that Li Auto may be in the running to become the EV leader in China. Though China’s economy and stock market have been struggling recently, a recovery there is yet another potential catalyst for this potentially new leader.Bear of the Day:Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock BankUnited Inc. is a Miami Lakes, Fl based bank established in 2009. BankUnited’s primary banking markets are Florida and the Tri-State area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.Rising ExpensesOver the past few years, BankUnited’s expenses have been rising consistently. Inflationary pressures and technology upgrades are keeping the company’s expenses elevated. Furthermore, worsening asset quality and exposure to risky loan portfolios are other headwinds.Risky Loan ExposureResidential and other consumer loans comprise approximately 35% of the company’s loan portfolio. The company also has loan exposure to many industries still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, including hotels, airlines, and cruise lines. These high-risk loan exposures may negatively impact the company’s financials moving forward.Spotty Earnings PictureSince 2021, BankUnited’s annual earnings per share has been declining. Meanwhile, revenue has remained essentially flat since 2018.For the full-year 2023, Zacks Consensus Estimates predict a fall in year-over-year EPS of ~14%.Negative ESP ScoreWith the current earnings already abysmal, the next step is for investors to try to predict the future. BKU earns a Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) score of -2.68%. The Zacks Earnings ESP score is a proprietary ranking that is derived from recent EPS revision activity. Stocks with positive ESP scores tend to beat on EPS and outperform and vice versa. BKU’s negative ESP score suggests that the company will miss earnings expectations when it reports in July and will underperform.Weak Industry GroupThe banking sector has been the weakest area of the equity market in 2023. BankUnited is part of the Zacks Banks – Major Regional Industry Group which holds a poor rank of 232 out of the 250 industries tracked by Zacks (bottom 7%). Because roughly half of a stock’s price movement is beholden to the underlying industry group, BKU is an avoid.Technical ViewLike most banks, BKU is underperforming the general market and showing signs of relative weakness. After finding support near the 2020 pandemic lows, the stock has rallied in the past few weeks to form a bear flag pattern.ConclusionA weak industry, rising costs, and spotty fundamentals are a few reasons investors should avoid BankUnited.Additional content:2 Dividend-Paying Air Freight and Cargo Stocks You May Count OnThe Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry continues to grapple with issues like supply-chain disruptions and higher fuel costs.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating NiSource (NYSE:NI), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for NiSource, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.053 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, NiSource has an ROCE of 5.3%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 5.0%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for NiSource roceIn the above chart we have measured NiSource's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEIn terms of NiSource's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 5.3% and the business has deployed 36% more capital into its operations. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.What We Can Learn From NiSource's ROCEIn summary, NiSource has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 29% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.Story continuesNiSource does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is potentially serious...While NiSource may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The company is also likely to benefit from new customer additions. The completion of the Narragansett Electric acquisition increases predictability of earnings.  However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s dependence on its subsidiaries and strong competition in the transmission business act as headwinds.TailwindsPPL’s capital investment plan primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution. Customers have been experiencing far less outages, courtesy of the ongoing investments in infrastructure strengthening. The company expects a regulated capital investment of $12 billion during 2023-2026.The completion of the Narragansett Electric Company’s acquisition on May 25, 2022, substantiates PPL's strategic repositioning as an U.S.-focused energy company. The buyout will give PPL a more diversified asset portfolio, lowering income from coal generation and increasing the chances of investing in a sustainable energy future.The company is also working on reducing its operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs by at least $175 million through 2026. In 2023, PPL expects to save $50-$60 million in O&amp;M costs. It is focused on reducing total operating expenses in the coming years, owing to a decrease in fuel costs and energy purchases.HeadwindsPPL’s Pennsylvania Regulated segment faces competition for transmission projects.

The stock has declined 8.1% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why ZBH Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 25.86 for ZBH is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for ZBHThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ZBH in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 5.8% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ZBH currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

In the first quarter, the top line was well above the company’s organic revenue guidance range (approximately 2.0% to 3.5%). A favorable solvency structure also instills optimism. However, escalated expenses and stiff competition do not bode well for Integra.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 38.1% compared with the industry’s 3% fall and a 1.7% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $3.15 billion. Integra has an earnings yield of 8.58% against the industry’s yield of -6.96%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the remaining one occasion, delivering an average surprise of 5.76%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsStrong Prospects in CSS: Integra sees healthy demand for its industry-leading products within its CSS segment. During the first quarter, the company expanded the global CUSA (Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator) portfolio with the launch of the CUSA Clarity bone tip in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, Integra is progressing well as far as resolving the electrical interference issue in the CereLink monitors is concerned and expects to relaunch the same toward the end of the third quarter of 2023. Across international business within CSS, growth in Japan was led by sales in CUSA capital and disposables and DuraGen. China benefited from the recovery of rolling COVID lockdowns and continued geographic expansion.Impressive Q1 Performance: In the first quarter of 2023, Integra’s revenues beat the Zacks Consensus estimates while earnings were in line. Tissue Technologies registered double-digit growth, banking on the strong performances of a number of leading products in the wound reconstruction franchise such as Integra Skin, Gentrix and Cytal, along with high single-digit growth from SurgiMend. The company also launched MicroMatrix in Europe where it is seeing positive initial feedback from wounds and reconstructive surgeons.Story continuesIn the CSS segment, the company also had a good start to the year with double-digit growth in the CUSA product line and programmable valves as well as strong performance in instrument sales. Integra reaffirmed its financial guidance for 2023, considering the recovery of markets prior to pandemic levels and the impact of its commercial capability build out and new products.Stable Solvency Structure: Despite the first quarter’s total debt of $1.44 billion being quite higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalent level of $307 million, Integra did not have any short-term-payable debt on its balance sheet at the quarter end. This is good news in terms of the company’s solvency position, particularly during the time of economic downturn.DownsidesMounting Expenses Strain Margins: In the first quarter, Integra’s adjusted operating margin saw a 292-basis points contraction year over year, driven by a 4.2% increase in Selling, General &amp; Administrative expenses and a 10.9% rise in Research &amp; Development expenses. The year-over-year decline in the company’s gross margin is attributed to unfavorable product and geographic mix along with Boston quality project expenses.Tough Competitive Pressure: The company faces significant competition in the surgical implants and medical instruments market. In addition, Integra competes with many smaller specialized companies as well as larger companies that do not otherwise focus on specialty surgical solutions. Other major players in orthopedics and tissue technologies include the DePuy/Synthes business of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Wright Medical Group, N.V., Smith &amp; Nephew plc, MiMedx Group, Inc., Acelity L.P.

For instance, Lindsay's FieldNET customers will be alerted about new soil moisture and weather monitoring capabilities developed and field-tested by Pessl. This will help growers make better irrigation management decisions.In addition to supporting farmers in understanding the requirement of crops, the collaboration will enable them to make the correct decision at the right time, thereby saving time and resources.Lindsay has been benefiting from its strategic initiatives for the past few years. The company is well-poised to benefit from the rising global demand for food due to population growth.

261,fe884b24-e639-3d8f-ab7a-eb1509ae8933,TSCO,2023-05-31,Here's Why it is Apt to Hold Tractor Supply (TSCO) for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-apt-hold-tractor-135100280.html,1685454660.0,STORY,"['TSCO', 'TJX']","[Tractor Supply Company TSCO has been favored by investors on the back of continued market share growth and progress on its strategic initiatives. Moreover, TSCO benefited from its Life Out Here Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy product demand.Notably, sales grew 9.1% year over year to $3,299.2 million, driven by contributions from the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition concluded in October 2022, store openings, and increased comparable store sales (comps). Comps improved 2.1%, led by growth in comparable average tickets, offset by a decline in comparable average transactions.The company’s comparable average ticket improved 2.8%, while the comparable average transaction count was down 0.7%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comp growth.Additionally, an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for ADM’s current financial year have increased 0.3% to $10.49 over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperThe company has been focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. It is on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy aimed at connecting stores and online shopping. Some of its notable omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app.In the first quarter, its e-commerce business performed well, with its mobile app representing more than 20% of its digital sales. Earlier, it launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in store and anywhere Visa is accepted. Tractor Supply exited the first quarter with more than 30 million Neighbor's Club members. The company’s rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners.Also, TSCO is progressing well with its Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars, which include customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return. As part of the plans, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026.Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously projected 8-10%. Earlier, the company launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”) and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.Tractor Supply is also in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant.Moving on, the expansion of the company’s store base and the incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line bode well. In the first quarter, it opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. As of Apr 1, 2023, it operated 2,164 Tractor Supply stores across 49 states, including 81 Orscheln Farm and Home acquired in 2022. The company expects to complete the conversion of 81 Orscheln Farm and Home to Tractor Supply stores by the end of 2023.Story continuesDriven by these factors, management expects fiscal 2023 net sales of $15-$15.3 billion. Comp growth is likely to be 3.5-5.5%. The company is likely to witness comp sales toward the top half of its guidance in the second quarter.TSCO also anticipates strength in CUE products and DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Its second and third quarters are anticipated to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while the fourth quarter is expected to be at the low end of the guidance range. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 12.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%.Hurdles on the WayDespite these upsides, Tractor Supply has been reeling under rising costs. In first-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 119 bps year over year to 28.1%.In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, rose 13.9% year over year to $925.5 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the deleverage due to moderate comps, and higher depreciation and amortization; the opening of a distribution center; and the impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition. Also, cost inflation is concerning.ConclusionOnline strength, solid demand and well-chalked-out endeavors are likely to help the stock sustain its momentum. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.6% and a VGM Score of B drive optimism.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

It’s pretty safe to claim that even those not interested in the investing world are familiar with Warren Buffett.Buffett embodies the term ‘legendary investor’ probably more than any other and considering his decades of almost unrivalled stock picking success, it’s a thoroughly deserved epithet.For those looking to emulate a fraction of Buffett’s success and get ahead of the game, it makes sense to see which stocks currently reside in the Oracle of Omaha’s portfolio. And when some of those equities also have the support of one of Wall Street’s leading banks, such as Goldman Sachs, it conveys an even stronger message that the time might be right for loading up.Against this backdrop, we delved into the TipRanks database to get the lowdown on three stocks that currently get the endorsement from both Buffett and the banking giant. Let’s check the details.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)For our first Buffett/Goldman-backed name, we’ll turn to the energy sector and the multinational firm Occidental Petroleum. The Houston, Texas-based company engages in the exploration, production, and marketing of oil and gas. Active since 1920, Occidental has become one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States. The company also operates globally, with significant activities not only in the US but also in the Middle East and Latin America.With its know-how and global reach, the company benefited immensely from rising energy prices last year, and like many names in one of the few sectors to thrive, OXY stock had a stellar 2022 – notching gains of 117%. But its performance has been more muted this year.Affected by reduced volumes and prices for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and domestic natural gas, in Q1, revenue fell by 14.9% year-over-year to $7.26 billion, missing the Street’s forecast by $110 million. Profits also dropped, with adj. EPS falling by 48% to $1.09, which came in shy of the $1.37 consensus estimate.Story continuesAlthough free cash flow fell by 33% in Q1 to $1.69 billion, that hasn’t halted the company’s stock buying activities. In the quarter, Oxy repurchased $752 million worth of stock, keeping it on track to meet its $3 billion repurchase program for 2023.Despite the underperformance, to say Buffett remains an OXY fan is a bit of an understatement. OXY shares make up a bug chunk of his portfolio, and during Q1, Buffett purchased an additional 17,355,469 shares. Notably, he continued to demonstrate his faith in May by purchasing approximately 5.62 million more shares. As it stands, Buffett’s ownership of around 217.3 million OXY shares translates to a staggering $12.73 billion, representing an impressive 24.4% stake in the company.Buffett’s unwavering faith in OXY is backed up by Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta, who shares a positive view on the company. Mehta, a 5-star analyst, points out a few key reasons why OXY looks promising, noting: “We remain positive on OXY due to its attractive FCF generation potential (13% FCF yield vs. 9% for diversified peers), which can drive robust share repurchase and allow the company to redeem its preferred equity and simplify its corporate structure (a focus for the company this year). Our favorable FCF outlook is underpinned by above-mid-cycle cash flows from chemicals, and we continue to expect favorable upstream results from OXY’s Permian operations.”These comments underpin Mehta’s Buy rating while his $77 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 31%. (To watch Mehta’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an extra 7 Buys and Holds, each, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of 22%, considering the average target stands at $71.67. (See OXY stock forecast)Charter Communications (CHTR)Let’s now pivot from energy to a big player in the telecom industry. Charter Communications is one of the US’s largest telecommunications and mass media companies. In fact, by subscribers, it is the country’s second-largest cable operator. Charter provides a wide range of offerings including cable television, high-speed internet, and telephone services to residential and commercial customers. Operating under the brand name Spectrum, the company serves millions of customers across 41 states.In addition to its core services, Charter has also ventured into the streaming market with its video-on-demand platform, Spectrum TV, which offers a broad selection of movies and TV shows to subscribers.Despite missing expectations on the profit profile in last month’s 1Q23 report, investors seemingly preferred to focus on the positives. EPS of $6.65 missed consensus expectations of $7.50, but revenue grew by 3.4% year-over-year to $13.65 billion and surpassing the Street’s projection by $40 million. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.6% from the same period a year ago to reach $5.4 billion. In the quarter, the company also reported a record of 686,000 wireless net adds.As for Buffett’s involvement, he owns a chunk of CHTR stock. His total holdings of 3,828,941 shares are currently worth over $1.27 billion.The telecom giant also gets the support of Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman, who sees some shareholder pleasing moves ahead.“We remain confident that CHTR can achieve LSD EBITDA growth in 2023, with growth accelerating in 2H23 as opex comps ease… We continue to expect that CHTR will be able to sustain, and gradually ramp, its share repurchases over the next 5 years, even during periods of elevated capex, based on our outlook for sustained EBITDA growth, which should create additional borrowing capacity that we expect CHTR to use to fund buybacks. As such, we estimate that over the next 5 years CHTR will repurchase nearly $40bn of stock representing almost 60% of its market cap,” Feldman opined.Accordingly, Feldman rates CHTR shares a Buy rating along with a $450 price target. The implication for investors? Potential upside of 35% from current levels. (To watch Feldman’s track record, click here)The Goldman Sachs view represents the bulls here; the Street shows a definite split in the reviews for CHTR. Out of 16 recent analyst reviews, there are 7 Buys, 8 Holds, and 1 sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $469.65 average target, investors will be pocketing returns of 41% a year from now. (See CHTR stock forecast)Marsh &amp; Mclennan Companies (MMC)Now let’s shift gears once more to a globally recognized professional services company that has received endorsements from both Buffett and Goldman Sachs. Marsh &amp; McLennan is a prominent player in the field, specializing in risk management, insurance brokerage, and consulting services. The company operates through its four main subsidiaries: Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, and Oliver Wyman. With expertise spanning these diverse sectors, Marsh &amp; McLennan is well-positioned to deliver comprehensive solutions to its clients on a global scale.Marsh provides insurance broking and risk management solutions to clients, helping them deal with complex risks while protecting their assets. Guy Carpenter focuses on reinsurance brokerage and strategic advisory services, assisting insurers in managing their reinsurance needs. Mercer specializes in human resources consulting, offering a wide range of services related to employee benefits, talent management, and retirement planning. Lastly, Oliver Wyman provides management consulting services, assisting clients in various industries with strategic planning, risk assessment, and operational improvement.Being in business for more than 150 years, MMC has established itself as a trusted global name, and this was evident in the company’s most recently reported quarter – for 1Q23. Boosted by a strong display from its risk and insurance services, revenue climbed by 6.3% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, edging ahead of the forecast by $40 million. Adj. EPS of $2.53 improved on the $2.30 generated in the same period a year ago whilst also coming in $0.06 above Street expectations. During the quarter, the company bought back 1.8 million shares of its stock for $300 million.Buffett enters the frame here via the 404,911 MMC shares he presently holds. At the current price, these are worth over $70.58 million.The global services firm also has a fan in Goldman analyst Robert Cox. Scanning the Q1 print, Cox finds plenty of reassuring points to keep him on board.“We view MMC 1Q23 results as further evidence that the company is taking advantage of strong P&amp;C broking conditions, talent investments are producing results, and margins are set to continue expanding materially with further expense efficiencies identified,” the analyst explained. “The broad based RIS organic growth beat in the quarter combined with our expectations for modestly decelerating P&amp;C pricing and exposure growth leads us to raise our FY23 RIS organic growth estimate by 50bps to +9.7% (+7.1% excluding fiduciary investment income).”Putting these thoughts into grades and numbers, Cox rates MMC shares a Buy, backed by a $202 price target. Should the figure be met, investors are looking at upside of 16% from current levels. (To watch Cox’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, 3 analysts join Cox in the bull camp and with an additional 6 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $189.80, the average target implies shares have room for ~9% growth over the coming months.

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ.Valued at $14.2 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, BA will offer manufacturing, assembly and delivery of various peculiar support equipment for the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.Work related to this deal will be carried out in St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fixed-wing military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 6.5% during 2022-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections should benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.Story continuesNOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 4.7% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. The company delivered a solid four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.46%.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 7.2% improvement from the previous year’s reported figure.Price Movement and Zacks RankShares of Boeing have risen 56.7% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They look forward to the camaraderie they experience with their fellow team members. They feel empowered to be entrepreneurial, have room to innovate, and deliver significant value to customers and society. The work they do is impactful - as they strive to create a better, more sustainable future for all. This is the culture we are building at LyondellBasell.LyondellBasell has historically been a good place to work, and we are building on this strong foundation. Our new culture will support the implementation of our new strategy: to grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business, and step up our performance and culture. To be successful, we need strong leaders to guide employees through this change. As leaders, we must model the behaviors we want to see, create an environment people are drawn to work in, and set the right expectations for performance.In my view, these leadership qualities are critical to enabling cultural transformation:1. Model the way - According to the 2021 Trust Barometer Special Report, six in 10 job seekers choose their employer based on their beliefs. As leaders, we must believe in the mission and then embed it in everything we do. Our CEO, Peter Vanacker, has set a clear strategy and purpose for the company, and we recently rolled out a new set of corporate values. This clarity makes it easier for employees to decide if our corporate values align with their own, enabling them to bring their authentic self to work every day. I am excited to be part of the transformation Peter and our Executive Team are driving and look forward to helping employees feel the same.2. Be accessible - I have an open invitation for all employees to set up time to come talk to me and give me a chance to get to know them better, many of whom have taken me up on my offer. To me, this means our new culture is already working. I would ask all leaders in the company to take this approach - make connections, listen, share more and be present for not only your team, but for everyone you work with across the company.Story continues3. Do not tolerate mediocre performance - As a leader, we must be clear and consistent about performance expectations. The status quo may have worked in the past, but not so much going forward. Outstanding leaders ensure their employees understand what is expected of them and are willing to act decisively if they fall short. Employees know when not everyone pulls their own weight, and tolerating an ongoing imbalance in workload sends the wrong message internally.4. Have fun - Having fun at work is essential to employee motivation, inciting an entrepreneurial spirit, and building strong, cohesive teams. We spend enough hours doing our job and should have a little fun in the process. A great example of this was at a recent People &amp; Culture team lunch, the Human Resources Leadership Team and I organized an informal flash mob right in the middle of my opening comments. Most of our team were wondering what just happened, but this led to a room full of laughter and smiles, and showed the team that we prioritize having fun. We did have fun - you could feel it in the room, and those who didn't attend felt they had missed out on a fun experience where their leaders were ""being real.""When I think about what this company will look like in 10 years, I see a company in which this new culture we are talking about has taken root and become part of the fabric of the organization. When you walk into any LyondellBasell manufacturing site or office location, you will feel it. We attracted and retained top diverse talent globally - leaders who care about their people, know what is going on in their lives and respect work/life balance. As a result of this embedded culture, we exceeded our ambitious sustainability targets and created tremendous value for our shareholders. The journey we are on is exciting, and while I know we will enjoy the process, I also look forward to the future, when we get to look back and appreciate just how far we have come as an organization.To all the current leaders at LyondellBasell, we need your help to champion our new culture and facilitate this transition for all employees.

However, an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Improving pricing drives improved premiums and claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The Fed has already made two hikes in 2023, taking the tally to nine since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.Amid the tailwinds, the unpredictable nature of catastrophic events weighs on the underwriting profitability of insurers. Aon estimated a global economic loss of $313 billion in 2022 from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be more than $130 billion. Net underwriting loss increased seven-fold to $26.9 billion in 2022 per a report published in Insurance Journal. Per Verisk and APCIA, the combined ratio deteriorated 310 basis points year over year to 102.7% in 2022.Nonetheless, the insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization. Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.While a solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level supports insurers in strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.The industry has risen 0.1% year to date versus the Finance sector’s decrease of 1.6%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has witnessed an increase of 10.6% in the said time frame.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF and Markel Corporation MKL.  Cincinnati Financial, with a market capitalization of $15.5 billion, markets property and casualty insurance.

But most of them are narrowbody jets, which largely cater to domestic travel.Airlines in India, a country of 1.4 billion people, still have just 50 widebody planes deployed for long-haul travel, something GE sees changing as more Indians splurge on travel.""There's clearly a need for more widebody aircraft,"" Vikram Rai, GE Aerospace's country head for India and Indonesia told Reuters, adding it would be ""the next path of growth"".GE estimates by 2030 India's international passenger traffic will hit 125 million from 70 million in 2019. Over the same period, India's middle-class population is seen rising to 700 million from around 450 million, spurring demand.""That is more than the population of the U.S., which has 5,500-6,000 commercial aircraft in service, as against 700 for India. So, there is room for significant growth,"" Rai said.GE's bullish outlook for India comes after a recent record deal to supply 800 fuel-efficient LEAP engines for 400 Air India narrowbody jets, part of a mega plane order. GE will also supply engines for 30 of the 70 widebody planes on order.This comes on top of an order pipeline for IndiGo's 500 Airbus narrowbody planes and a deal to power startup airline Akasa's 72 Boeing aircraft - giving GE a stranglehold on India's narrowbody jet market.GE's dominance has also been cemented by engine reliability issues at rival Pratt &amp; Whitney that have forced Indian carriers to ground dozens of planes and pushed airlines like IndiGo, the country's largest, to switch suppliers.Story continuesPrime Minister Narendra Modi wants aerospace and defence to become key engines to drive the world's fifth-largest economy, and companies like Airbus and Boeing have recently committed to more local manufacturing and investment.GE is also strengthening its supply chain and manufacturing in the country where, among other investments, it builds engine parts with Tata Group for export to its global factories. In November, it renewed its $1 billion contract with the Indian giant.While Rai declined to share an outlook on future investments, he said GE's spending on components in India had increased 20 times in the last five years, adding it was a ""strategic market for GE Aerospace"".]"

Horton, Inc. DHI, NVR, Inc. NVR, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL and Meritage Homes Corp. MTH.Industry: HomebuildingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2101459/5-top-ranked-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-homebuilding-industryThe U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, rising raw material and labor costs. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, more stabilized mortgage rates, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like D.R. Horton, Inc., NVR, Inc., PulteGroup Inc., Toll Brothers, Inc. and Meritage Homes Corp. have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities.The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties; residential real estate; and oil and gas assets.4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureSuburban Shift, Lack of Supply, Improved Builder Confidence: The changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence. Demand for new homes is improving in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.Story continuesMeanwhile, there is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders.Builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes in May inched up five points to 50 points, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. This marked the fifth straight month of builder confidence increase and the first time of sentiment levels reaching the midpoint mark of 50 since July 2022. Homebuilders are getting a major boost from the lack of existing homes for sale, helping industry players to navigate some of the challenges they are facing from financial markets.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues as well as profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. On May 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% while leaving its options open on future rate hikes.The central bank's move pushed the Fed funds rate to a new range of 5%-5.25%, the highest since September 2007. Notably, as part of the Fed’s rate hiking drive since the 1980s, the U.S. central bank has lifted the range for its benchmark interest rate by 5 percentage points since March 2022. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Tight Labor &amp; Credit Markets: Although there has been a modest improvement in the supply chain and some easing in labor constraints, supply-chain challenges are still expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times to some extent in the near term. Continuous supply-chain issues in various countries have been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time.With Europe facing severe energy crises, supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in the near term as well. Again, the shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America’s economy and infrastructure rebuilding efforts.Meanwhile, although lumber prices have been dropping since March 2023, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is a 19-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #8, which places it in the top 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Grainger and Li Auto",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-dr-090000870.html,1685523600,STORY,"['GWW', 'DHI', 'LI', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 31, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: DR Horton DHI, W.W. Grainger GWW and Li Auto LI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Nonfarm Payrolls in Focus: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, the focus will — once again — be on macro data.Key May 2023 nonfarm jobs data in the United States, Mainland China manufacturing activity data, and Euro Area inflation readings should give stock traders more evidence on the pull-and-push factors impacting the world's top economies.A deal on the U.S. debt ceiling, struck on Sunday, will move to Congress for a vote.In Turkey, voters gave President Tayyip Erdogan a mandate for another five years.Meanwhile, info tech investors are on the hunt for undervalued opportunities — in an over-valued space.Next: Reuters’ 5 World Market Themes, Reordered for Equity Traders—(1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Mania Picks UpArtificial Intelligence is having a moment. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia soared some 25% in a single day after issuing bullish revenue forecasts.The technology took center stage when Microsoft-backed Open AI unleashed its essay-writing bot ChatGPT last November. Industry insiders forecast huge progress in the competence of this so-called generative AI, while regulators and politicians fret about AI stealing jobs, or spreading misinformation.For investors, it raises a whole other sort of questions: Will AI cause long-term deflation? Will it create new jobs and new industries? And how will it make money?Stocks linked to AI are surging but all the tech's ramifications are far from certain yet. Remember the dotcom bubble?(2) On Friday, the Preliminary May U.S. Nonfarm Payroll Count ArrivesWill U.S. jobs data out on June 2nd show that the world's top economy is strong enough to avoid a recession but not so hot that it forces another hawkish move by the Federal Reserve?Story continuesNon-farm payrolls for May are expected to record job growth of 180,000, according to a Reuters poll. In April, U.S. job growth accelerated to add 253,000 with wage gains increasing solidly.The jobs report will be one of the last pieces of data before the June Fed meeting, where the central bank is expected to hit pause on its aggressive 14-month-old rate hiking cycle to tamp down inflation.Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday finalized a budget agreement with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling until Jan. 1st, 2025, and said the deal was ready to move to Congress for a vote.(3) Lots of Mainland China Macro Data Comes OutIt's China's turn for PMI report cards — and there's little reason to expect any turnaround in the ailing economy.From inflation figures to retail sales, recent data has without fail painted a dreary picture of lackluster domestic demand.It seems the only thing the Chinese consumer wants is lottery tickets, with sales soaring to a decade high, staking their fortunes on luck rather than policy makers.There is optimism in the interbank repo market, though, where record activity is a sure sign that traders expect central bank stimulus soon.Of course, burst hopes of a post-COVID boom aren't the only reason for caution: the tit-for-tat tech export spat with the U.S. continues to ramp up, while the Asian giant keeps sidling closer to Russia, provoking much discomfort in the West.(4) Lots of Euro Area Macro Data Comes Out, TooAt its meeting three weeks ago, the ECB reiterated that it was very much in rate-hiking mode to tame inflation. Markets, not convinced, dialed back bets for further increases and focused on weakening growth. Germany just entered a recession.Yet, it is traders that — for now — have had to rethink their view. Thursday's flash May Eurozone inflation number and a slew of national data in the days ahead will likely stoke the peak rate debate. Eurozone business activity remains resilient, core inflation is sticky above 5% and wage pressures are picking up.HSBC expects the ECB's key rate to peak at 4% from a current 3.25%. Data on Wednesday meanwhile showed UK inflation eased by less than in April, sending gilt yields rocketing. Traders know that they, like central bankers and economists, don't always get it right.(5) Turkey’s Erdogan Wins a New Term in PowerPresident Tayyip Erdogan extended his two decades in power in elections on Sunday, winning a mandate to pursue increasingly authoritarian policies that have polarized Turkey and strengthened its position as a regional military power.Erdogan prevailed despite years of economic turmoil which critics blame on unorthodox economic policies.While analysts expected that Erdogan would have to adjust some of his heterodox policies to ensure the country's economy, marked by boom-and-bust cycles, would find some smoother waters ahead, they were cautious over just how much change a new government would herald.Turkey's lira wobbled near record lows against the dollar on Monday, just shy of the 20.06 low hit on Friday.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksNext are three large-cap stocks that look interesting.(1) DR Horton: This is a $107 stock.

296,0341dcdb-dcd8-3a39-939d-142198c02e85,DHI,2023-05-31,5 Top-Ranked Stocks to Buy From the Promising Homebuilding Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-ranked-stocks-buy-153300440.html,1685460780,STORY,"['DHI', 'NVR', 'MTH', 'PHM', '^GSPC', 'TOL']","[The U.S. housing space continues to grapple with accelerating mortgage rates, rising raw material and labor costs. That said, the rising need for more work-at-home space, lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, more stabilized mortgage rates, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting the confidence of the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry players. Companies like D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, NVR, Inc. NVR, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL and Meritage Homes Corporation MTH have been gaining from their fundamental strength and the above-mentioned tailwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry comprises manufacturers of residential and commercial buildings. Some industry players are involved in providing financial services that include selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agencies as well as closing services. The industry players are involved in building single-family detached and attached home communities; townhouses, condominiums, duplexes and triplexes; master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities; and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities. The companies are also involved in the purchase, development and sale of residential land. Additionally, the companies build and own multi-family rental properties; residential real estate; and oil and gas assets.4 Trends Shaping the Homebuilding Industry's FutureSuburban Shift, Lack of Supply, Improved Builder Confidence: The changing geography of housing demand has been supporting builder confidence. Demand for new homes is improving in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.Meanwhile, there is a sizable shortage of new homes after more than a decade of under-building compared with population growth. Although demand has slowed recently, supply remains very low. Continued demand for homes despite rising mortgage interest rates amid low supply has been generating profit for homebuilders.Builder confidence in the market for newly-built single-family homes in May inched up five points to 50 points, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. This marked the fifth straight month of builder confidence increase and the first time of sentiment levels reaching the midpoint mark of 50 since July 2022. Homebuilders are getting a major boost from the lack of existing homes for sale, helping industry players to navigate some of the challenges they are facing from financial markets.Cost-Control Efforts, Focus on Entry-Level Buyers &amp; Acquisitions: Given the accelerated raw material prices, companies have been relying on effective cost control and focusing on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. Some homebuilders also follow a dynamic pricing model, which enables them to set the price according to the latest market conditions.Again, the majority of companies are focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes and addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns in the U.S. housing market. Meanwhile, industry players have been acquiring other homebuilding companies in desirable markets, resulting in improved volumes, market share, revenues as well as profitability.Higher Rates: The home affordability issue remains a headwind owing to accelerating mortgage rates. While remaining committed to combating inflation, the Fed raised interest rates last year at the fastest pace since the 1980s, pushing borrowing costs above 5% from near zero. On May 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% while leaving its options open on future rate hikes. The central bank's move pushed the Fed funds rate to a new range of 5%-5.25%, the highest since September 2007. Notably, as part of the Fed’s rate hiking drive since the 1980s, the U.S. central bank has lifted the range for its benchmark interest rate by 5 percentage points since March 2022. This is less encouraging for this rate-sensitive market, which accounts for almost 3% of the economy.Tight Labor &amp; Credit Markets: Although there has been a modest improvement in the supply chain and some easing in labor constraints, supply-chain challenges are still expected to continue to impact the level of housing starts and construction cycle times to some extent in the near term. Continuous supply-chain issues in various countries have been impacting builders’ ability to deliver on time. With Europe facing severe energy crises, supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist in the near term as well. Again, the shortage of skilled construction labor continues to be a pressing concern. With the rising demand for construction, the industry requires more skilled professionals, which is vital to America’s economy and infrastructure rebuilding efforts. Meanwhile, although lumber price has been dropping since March 2023, there still exists supply shortages of building materials as well as tightening credit conditions for residential real estate development and construction due to the recent banking crisis and higher interest rates.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is a 19-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #8, which places it in the top 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a higher earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

(NYSE:UHS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-universal-health-161914397.html,1685463554,STORY,['UHS'],"[Key InsightsUniversal Health Services' estimated fair value is US$139 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$128 suggests Universal Health Services is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 9.2% lower than Universal Health Services' analyst price target of US$153How far off is Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$585.5mUS$579.5mUS$579.3mUS$582.9mUS$589.1mUS$597.2mUS$606.7mUS$617.3mUS$628.8mUS$641.0mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.03%Est @ 0.61%Est @ 1.06%Est @ 1.38%Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.75%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$544US$500US$465US$434US$408US$384US$362US$343US$324US$307(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.1bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$641m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$12bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$5.7bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$9.7b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$128, the company appears about fair value at a 7.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Universal Health Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.931. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Universal Health ServicesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The company hiked dividend twice in 2021.In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. It paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million.In first-quarter 2023, UNP returned $1.4 billion to its shareholders through dividends ($795 million) and share repurchases ($575 million). Management anticipates a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings) in 2023. UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities.The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) as labor woes ease is an added positive. In 2022, volumes (measured in revenue carloads) at the Bulk and Industrial segments increased 2% and 5%, respectively. Volumes at the Premium segment were flat year over year in 2022.In fourth-quarter 2022, overall volumes were up 1%.Key RisksWe are concerned about Union Pacific's high-debt levels. Debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio (adjusted) at UNP was 2.7 at the end of 2021. It increased to 2.9 at 2022 end.The ratio was 2.9 at the end of the first quarter of 2023 as well. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a firm may be unable to service its debt appropriately.Increase in fuel costs due to an uptick in oil prices is limiting bottom-line growth. In 2022, expenses on fuel escalated 68%, leading to a 20% increase in operating costs. Due to high costs, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) deteriorated 270 basis points to 62.1% in first-quarter 2023.Story continuesIn the March quarter, total operating expenses rose 8% to $3,762 million, with fuel expenses increasing 7%. In 2023, capex is expected to be $2.3 billion. High capex may also hurt the company's free cash flow generating ability.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUNP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT. While Copa sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Allegiant carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Copa Holdings is benefiting from an improvement in air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, passenger revenues increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels due to higher yields.CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging. In first-quarter 2023, cargo and mail revenues grew 51.8% from first-quarter 2019 levels on higher cargo volumes and yields.Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 21.3% upward over the past 60 days.Allegiant is seeing a steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, operating revenues grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, accounting for 93.7% of the top line, increased 31.3% on a year-over-year basis.Allegiant's fleet-modernization efforts are encouraging.

Moms not only create life but their focus on nurturing their children year after year and ensuring their safety and ability to flourish is unparalleled. Mother Earth does the same. For millions of years, Mother Earth has been protecting us, providing a safe and abundant environment to live and raise our families.According to the United Nations (UN) report Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The gender snapshot 2022, ""Women play transformative roles in climate change adaptation and mitigation despite many obstacles"" with many taking on grassroot efforts to make a change in their own communities. Women are also taking leadership positions in the field of sustainability. At large companies, 58 percent of sustainability executives are female. And according to the 2022 GreenBiz State of the Profession report, the number of women in sustainability leadership roles has expanded. That's good news for Mother Earth, since we know how innovative, persistent, and driven women can be when protecting their families.From my own personal experience, I was raised by a mother who was an environmentalist before most people knew what that was. She sold ""biodegradable"" cleaning products to the neighborhood moms, wrapped our sandwiches in wax paper and insisted we bring that paper home so she could reuse it the next day. She sewed some of our clothes out of left-over fabric (""We can't let this perfectly good fabric go to waste!"") and made us save our gum in water to rechew later (I know, I wish I were kidding, too). We walked and rode our bikes because gas emitted ""that black stuff into the air"" and donated all our used toys, books, clothing, etc. to the ""Bargain Box"" secondhand store down the road. My mom instilled in my siblings and me that we have to live in harmony with the Earth or she will kick us off. I took her on a hike last weekend and at 85 years old she was still ""schooling me"" on the wildflowers growing on Mt. Tamalpais and why they're important to the ecosystem.Story continuesAs a mom myself, I wanted to sit down with another mom at Cisco and learn more about her thoughts on sustainability. Elisabeth Brandasu is a global account manager for Equinor and sustainability lead for the North Theater in Cisco's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. She shares how being a mother has impacted her perspective on the environment and influenced her actions to create a more sustainable future.How did you get into the field of sustainability?Elisabeth: I was naïve until a few years ago. I was so busy with building my life, surviving those first few whirlwind years of being a young mom with a full-time job. At some point, I was offered the opportunity for a stretch assignment (which gives employees a chance to explore a different type of role by volunteering some of their time to another team) as inclusion and diversity lead for EMEA. That is where my calling for purpose-driven work started. I am privileged in many ways; I have a lot of energy and I want to use my voice for doing something purposeful. When sustainability came on my path it just really struck home. It's not just the sense of necessity in accelerating the needed change, but the enormous opportunity the transition provides too. It excites me.Did becoming a mother change your personal perspective about the work you're doing?Elisabeth: My worry for the kids really kicked in when they began school. As you release them into the wider world, you start envisioning their future and the planet we are leaving them. We don't inherit the planet from our parents, we borrow it from our children. I lovingly pour all my time and effort into the kids being safe and happy, now and for all their days to come. So, how could I stand by and let this monumental systemic transition the world so desperately needs pass me by? How can I push this onto my children's shoulders to resolve it?You circle back to yourself, thinking, ‘what can I do?' As a mom, you don't just sit by, and watch tragedy impact your kids. You step up and do whatever you can.What does working in sustainability mean to you?Elisabeth: Working in sustainability means so much more than ‘just a job'. It is continuous learning, giving back, amplifying the reach of our experts by spreading their word, scaling the community of ambassadors, training people to incorporate sustainability as a first thought in doing business. You don't necessarily need a formal education or background in sustainability to make a contribution. I believe I have found my own way of contributing and I know others can too. I am proud of the Green and Blue sustainability community at Cisco. It emerged from the internal Green and Blue Innovation Challenge in EMEA to stimulate as many ideas as possible, with green representing sustainability and blue representing the digital transformation. It is a force to be reckoned with and we have together accomplished so much. I want to be part of this movement of change for the better, because what we all wish for our children is the very best.How did you start the conversation about sustainability with your kids?Elisabeth: They've learned some very simple concepts about sustainability in school. They do not yet understand that if the world continues as it does, there will be some serious consequences.When speaking about a sustainable future, it's important to put a sense of hope into it, rather than risk paralyzing people with devastating outlooks. Hope activates! It's not about being perfect, it's about pledging yourself to do better all the time. I am also an optimistic realist. I choose to believe in our collective power to make amazing progress, steering us toward less devastating outcomes.The way I speak to my kids about it is that the world has been using more than it can replenish. The system is broken, so we are trying to build a new system and that is really complicated because everything is intertwined. Do I think they get it yet? No, but that's okay. They don't need to have it all figured out. But they're the type of kids that think about those things and are curious to learn more and it will eventually mature in their minds. For now, I just want them to be kids.Do you have any advice for actions that parents can take to help create a more sustainable future?Elisabeth: For me, there is a big focus on circularity. I try not to buy new things. So, everything I buy with the kids or for the kids I try to buy second hand. We're also focused on reducing waste, especially around food. We don't throw away food. When you have leftovers, you eat it again the next day. If they didn't eat their lunch, that's fine, but they need to have their lunch for dinner. My kids have very few toys and prefer to go outside to play.Also, I have been focused on energy minimization in the house and using energy at the lowest possible price and load balancing throughout the day. I don't cook while I have the washing machine on, and I don't charge the car while the dishwasher is on.Sustainability is a bit like exercise. Don't overdo it from the get-go. Allow yourself to embrace it and make it a habit. You don't need to save the world on day one. Educate yourself and understand the impact of your lifestyle. Decide what you are going to integrate into your normal routine and identify the things that you're going to step away from. Whatever you decide to do, it is okay because you've been conscious about the decision. Every day, there are probably at least 200 moments where you can make the decision to do the more sustainable thing. Are any of the individual actions that I take enough on their own? Definitely not, but it is about doing what you can do and keep on pushing to do better. It's a journey.We also need to stop passing judgement on people that aren't moving as fast when it comes to sustainability. It's counterproductive. Rather, meet them where they are, and inspire them to keep moving forward.Thirty years from now, I'm going to be retired. My kids will be the age I am now and will decide if they want to become parents. I don't want them to have existential worries and I don't want to look back on my own life thinking ‘I didn't do enough for the planet when I had a chance.' We can't defer action any longer, it's the responsibility of our generation, the ‘elders', to do what we can.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/758009/Cisco-A-Mother-Speaks-Up-for-Mother-Earth]"
