If you want to skip our detailed analysis on retiring overseas, visit the 10 Most Popular Overseas Retirement Destinations for Americans. Retirement Overseas From 1946 to 1964, the United States experienced a total of 76 million births. Referred to as the baby boomers, this generation has been the result of a robust postwar economy. Soldiers returning home from World War II wished to settle down and start a family. The GI Bill, a law that provided a range of benefits for some of the returning World War II veterans, further promised decent pay, good jobs, and affordable housing to those raising families.As of today, baby boomers have entered into the retirement phase. By 2030, every baby boomer would have turned 65 years or older. Add in the number of immigrants, and the United States currently houses more than 73 million older adults. The greying US population is no longer youthful as it once used to be. And for millions of these Americans, retirement seems a distant reality. Rising inflation, depreciating retirement accounts, and financial obligations have been crushing Americans and their retirement dreams.According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Modern Wealth Survey, Americans believe that now it takes at least $2.2 million to be wealthy, and the $1 million mark doesn't cut it anymore. The same goes for retirement, with figures for a comfortable retirement increasing from $1 million to $1.25 million in a span of years. Surprisingly, only 25% of retirees are able to save their incomes throughout their careers. Meanwhile, 75% of them are falling short of meeting their retirement goals.Given the United States' burden of an aging population, the risk of depleting social security funds, and its higher cost of living compared to many other countries, Americans are rapidly exploring their retirement options. Some of the best expat retirement countries they are moving to include Costa Rica, France, Portugal, Thailand, and the Dominican Republic.Story continuesBest Countries to Retire for US CitizensEvery year, more and more Americans are leaving the United States and retiring abroad. According to Social Security Administration, 443,546 retired workers received their social security checks outside of the USA in 2021. As such, some of the best countries to retire for US citizens include Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Portugal. As these countries offer a lower cost of living than the United States, Americans receiving their social security checks there can stretch their retirement income further. Costa Rica and Panama are not only cheap but also some of the easiest countries to retire to. For those looking for affordable options, some of the cheapest countries for retirement include South Africa, Romania, Malaysia, and Portugal. Many retirees prefer healthcare over everything else, which is why they should consider retiring to countries such as Malaysia and Spain. These are some of the best places to retire overseas for affordable and efficient healthcare.For individuals looking to draw their social security outside of the US, many banks can be used to draw social security checks in foreign countries. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) highlights that Americans living outside the US may encounter difficult challenges when dealing with financial transactions. However, their services can help individuals invest in US markets from abroad, access US dollar-based accounts, and tax filing. Apart from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), other companies that can be used are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C).Let's move now to the list of popular overseas places to retire for US citizens.30 Most Popular Overseas Retirement Destinations for AmericansPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyTo compile the list of most popular overseas retirement destinations for Americans, we have used data from Social Security Administration to determine the total number of retired workers receiving benefits in foreign countries or regions.

1,fe038a39-d3e6-321a-bf41-02ef04c61eb3,SCHW,2023-08-01,I am 50 Years Old and Have No Retirement Savings,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/am-50-years-old-no-144140491.html,1690814500,STORY,['SCHW'],"[This article is written on the topic; I am 50 years old and have no retirement savings. The article discusses the consequences of lacking retirement savings, the best ways to boost them, as well as the cheapest places to retire on social security. You can skip the details and head directly to Top 10 Cities for 50-Year Old People With No Retirement Savings.What Happens If You Have No Retirement Savings?Millions of Americans are nearing retirement empty-handed, meaning they must curtail their retirement spending dramatically or continue working during their retirement years. The situation is only likely to worsen, considering two-thirds of individuals don’t contribute to a (401) k or a retirement savings account at all. Many need more cash to contribute to such plans, and yet others need access to such workplace retirement plans.Census researchers Michael Gideon and Joshua Mitchell report that only 79% of Americans are provided with retirement plans through their employers, and merely 41% of workers at such places contribute to these plans. For individuals who think that contributing to these plans is enough, the reality is quite different. One has to ensure they steer clear of these savings until after they have retired. Unfortunately, rising inflation levels have had many individuals dipping into their retirement funds. According to Fidelity, the number of hardship withdrawals increased to 2.4% in 2022, following an 8.5% decade-high level of inflation in the same period.For those having no retirement savings at 65, social security can be their best bet. However, the average social security check for an individual is around $1,701.62, and the average household run by a 65-year-old can require as much as $4,000. Risks of social security funds depletion by 2033 are only worsening the outlook for retirees, leaving them with fewer options to secure a comfortable retirement. Insider Monkey notes that retiring to states that don’t tax social security can help. In particular, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas can be good choices, considering they are some of the best states for the cost of living and taxes.Story continuesFor potential retirees who still have some time, starting to save right away can help them retire despite not having any retirement savings. Many big financial companies can help steer such individuals in the right direction, such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company helping people, institutions, and governments in raising, managing, and distributing the capital they need to achieve their goals.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) offers banking, commercial banking, investing, and other financial services to both retail and institutional clients. Moreover, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company serving individuals, businesses, and large corporations.Best Ways to Boost Retirement Savings till 65If you're wondering how to catch up on retirement savings in your 50s, read on below:Act NowMerrill Edge, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), recommends that the best action to boost retirement savings is to start saving today. Starting early and letting your assets grow allows individuals to invest less and accumulate more along the way. For instance, a 25-year-old investing only $75 per month is likely to have more assets accumulated than an individual investing $100 at age 35. The bottom line is whether you're 60 years old and have no retirement savings, or merely 25, the best action to take is to start immediately.Calculate Your Retirement Needs While Baby Boomers need only $1.25 million to retire comfortably, millennials and Gen-Z will likely require as much as $3 million, accounting for inflation. That said, your retirement needs depend on your annual expenses. Determine how much you need to have for a comfortable retirement so that you can start saving accordingly.Contribute to Your Retirement Account Next, understand your retirement account options and start contributing. Your retirement account options largely depend on where and how you work. For-profit employers usually offer a 401(k) account. In such a case, you will be asked to fill out a form stating the percentage of your paycheck you want saved. When done, your employer will save the amount with a company such as Vanguard, Fidelity, or The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). If your employer doesn’t offer you a plan, simply use the services of financial service firms like Schwab.Consider Bonds Over StocksAccording to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), U.S. equities are struggling to break out of a bear market while bond yields have meaningfully increased. Inflation is expected to be around 3.5% by the end of 2023, and U.S. treasuries are reported to yield more than that through the 10-year maturity. This further implies that inflation-adjusted yields could turn positive, and bonds could provide an extra 1.5 to 2.5 percentage points beyond Treasury yields. Moreover, bonds are relatively fair-priced and also offer attractive capital gains.Take Advantage of Catch-up ContributionsIf you are 50 with no retirement savings, it's time to do some catching up. Fortunately, individuals aged 50 or older can go beyond normal contribution limits to retirement accounts with ""catch-up contributions."" These contributions can significantly boost your retirement savings.Automate Savings and Control SpendingAdditionally, consider making your retirement contributions automatic so that your retirement nest egg continues to grow without you having to remember it. Remember to control your spending along the way, too. This move will help you save or invest more than you currently do.Find Out the Cheapest Places to Retire on Social SecurityHopefully, now you're on the right track to saving sufficiently for your retirement years. One additional step you can take is to figure out the cheapest places to retire on social security. Doing so will allow you to stretch your retirement savings further and cover additional expenses that may arise.I am 50 Years Old and Have No Retirement SavingsImage by pasja1000 from PixabayMethodologyTo compile the list of cheapest places to retire on social security, we listed out the cheapest countries for retirement under $1,781, the average monthly retirement benefit for Security Security recipients. Countries were assesed on their monthly individual costs of living and crime indexes to pick out 10 cheapest countries.Next, we used Quora, Reddit, and similar forums to pick out cheapest places within each country and rank them based on their costs of living.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results. Western Digital's fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded expectations as our access to broad go-to-market channels, enviable retail franchise and strong client SSD portfolio enabled us to capture demand upsides in both client and consumer end markets, reaffirming our strength in a challenging market environment. We reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.7 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 3.9%. And non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Before diving into the specifics of the quarter and the full fiscal year, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our accomplishments in fiscal year 2023. Importantly, we continue to optimize our operations and successfully executed our innovative product road map, priming ourselves for greater profitability when demand rebounds across hard drives and flash. Throughout the fiscal year, we were focused on enhancing our product leadership and reinforcing our business agility. In HDD, we have successfully qualified our latest family of capacity enterprise hard drives that all major customers and are shipping our 26 terabyte UltraSMR drive in high volume. In Flash, we pioneered the use of wafer bonding in advanced 3D NAND manufacturing and introduced the groundbreaking technology in BiCS8, which sets the foundation for future 3D NAND scaling. On the expense front, we streamlined investments across our HDD and Flash portfolio which enabled us to significantly reduce quarterly operating expense while continuing to deliver innovative products and technologies to address customers' growing storage needs. Further, we reduced our cash capital expenditure run rate by over 50% in the fiscal second half and consolidated our hard drive manufacturing footprint. These efforts enabled Western Digital to preserve capital while effectively executing on product strategies and aligning our supply with post-pandemic demand environment. Notably, we reduced our inventory by nearly $300 million sequentially and exited fiscal year 2023 at a much healthier level than a few quarters ago. And in June, we successfully completed amendments to our credit agreements, which provide Western Digital with significant additional financial flexibility as we navigate macro dynamics. In summary, we continue to proactively take action to bolster our agility enhance our liquidity position, optimize our inventory levels across HDD and Flash and strengthened our position as an industry and market leader. We exited fiscal year 2023 well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and capture long-term growth opportunities in data storage, spanning from client to edge to cloud. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the strategic review is ongoing. We continue to make progress on this process and will provide updates as appropriate. Turning to the fiscal fourth quarter. revenue in both client and consumer end markets returned to sequential growth, led by normalized end market demand and higher average capacity per unit in Flash. In Consumer, Retail Flash exceeded our expectations across all major product categories. We saw similar results in client with upside in both HDD and flash and across almost all major product categories, including client SSD, gaming console, embedded flash and client hard drives. In cloud, demand for both hard drive and flash products remain subdued. I'll now turn to business updates, starting with HDD. In the fiscal fourth quarter, ongoing cloud weakness drove the overall decline in HDD revenue. However, demand for both client and consumer hard drives has stabilized and exceeded our expectations. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we have successfully qualified all variants of our 22 terabyte CMR and 26 terabyte UltraSMR hard drive platforms at all major cloud customers, setting the stage to improve shipments and profitability. In addition, we are about to begin product sampling of our 28-terabyte UltraSMR drive. This cutting-edge product is built upon the success of our ePMR and UltraSMR technologies, with features and reliability trusted by our customers worldwide. We are staging this product for quick qualification and ramp as demand improves. Turning to Flash. Revenue increased sequentially led by growth in both client and consumer flash bit shipments, which exceeded our expectations with total bit shipments returning to year-over-year growth. The stronger-than-expected bit growth is attributable to normalizing PC and consumer demand as well as content growth. Average capacity per consumer and client SSD increased over 40% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. Moving to technology developments. We continue to aggressively productize BiCS8 based on a chip bonded to array architecture. BiCS8 solidifies Western Digital and Kok's leadership in cost, capital efficiency and I/O performance into the future. Before I turn it over to Wissam, I wanted to share some perspective on our outlook. In HDD, as we look to the fiscal first quarter, we expect overall demand to remain stable. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both improving demand and new product ramps to drive growth in revenue and profitability. In Flash, we are encouraged by several indicators signaling improving market dynamics. Notably, our 2 largest end markets, client and consumer are returning to growth, inventories are normalizing, content per unit is increasing and price declines have been moderating. With that, I'll turn it over to Wissam.Wissam G. JabreThanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As David mentioned, fiscal fourth quarter revenue exceeded our expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, down 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss per share was $1.98. Looking at end markets for the fiscal fourth quarter, cloud represented 37% of total revenue at $1 billion, down 18% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sequentially, the decline was primarily due to a decrease in capacity enterprise drive shipments. Nearline bit shipments were 59 exabytes, down 26% sequentially, driven by ongoing weakness at cloud customers. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to declines in both hard drive and flash product shipments. Client represented 39% of total revenue at $1 billion, up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was driven by growth in bit shipments for gaming consoles. The year-over-year decrease was due to declines in Flash pricing and lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Consumer represented 24% of total revenue at $0.6 billion, up 3% sequentially and down 19% year-over-year. Sequentially, the increase was primarily due to higher retail SSD shipments. The year-over-year decrease was driven by price declines in Flash and lower retail Hard Drive shipments. For the fiscal year, revenue was $12.3 billion, down 34% from fiscal 2022. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 17.2 percentage points to 15.7%, and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 21.8 percentage points to negative 4.8%. Non-GAAP loss per share was $3.59. Looking at end markets for fiscal year 2023, cloud revenue decreased 34% year-over-year primarily due to reduced shipments of capacity enterprise hard drives and enterprise SSDs. Client revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, primarily due to declines in Flash pricing as well as lower client SSD and hard drive unit shipments for PC applications. Lastly, Consumer revenue decreased 26% for the year as growth in retail SSD bit shipments was more than offset by broad-based Flash price decline and lower consumer Hard Drive shipments. Turning now to revenue by segment. In the fiscal fourth quarter, HDD revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Sequentially, total HDD exabyte shipments decreased 18% and average price per unit decreased 9% to $99. On a year-over-year basis, HDD exabyte shipments decreased 38% and average price per unit decreased 17%. Flash revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 43% year-over-year. Sequentially, Flash ASPs decreased 6% on a blended basis and 9% on a like-for-like basis. Flash bit shipments increased 15% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Moving to costs and expenses. Please note that my comments will be related to non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 3.9%, down 6.7 percentage points sequentially and 28.4 percentage points year-over-year. This includes $272 million in costs or 10.2 percentage points for manufacturing underutilization, Flash inventory write-downs and other items. HDD gross margin was 20.7%, down 3.6 percentage points sequentially and 7.5 percentage points year-over-year. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to lower capacity enterprise volume as well as higher underutilization related charges. Underutilization charges were $76 million or 5.9 percentage points. Flash gross margin was negative 11.9%, down 6.9 percentage points sequentially and 47.8 percentage points year-over-year. Underutilization charges due to the reduced manufacturing volumes were $135 million, and inventory write-downs were $27 million, resulting in an 11.8 percentage point reduction. We continue to tightly manage our operating expenses of $582 million for the quarter, down $20 million sequentially and $178 million year-over-year. Operating loss in the quarter was $478 million, driven mainly by underutilization charges, inventory write-downs and other items totaling $272 million. Income tax expense was $57 million for fiscal fourth quarter and $237 million for fiscal year 2023. Despite the consolidated loss, we continue to have taxable income in certain geographies, resulting in taxes payable in those areas. Fiscal fourth quarter loss per share was $1.98, inclusive of $15 million dividend associated with the convertible preferred equity. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $68 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $219 million. Cash capital expenditures which include the purchase of property, plant and equipment and activity related to our Flash joint ventures on the cash flow statement were $151 million. Gross debt outstanding was $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal fourth quarter. Trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter, as defined in our credit agreement, was $1.6 billion, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 4.5x compared to 2.8x in the fiscal third quarter. As a reminder, the credit agreement includes 0.7 billion in depreciation add-back associated with the Flash joint ventures. This is not reflected in the cash flow statement. Please refer to the earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website for further details. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we executed amendment to our credit agreements. These amendments include modifications to the leverage ratio requirements applicable through the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which provide additional financial flexibility in the near term. We also extended the commitment under the delayed draw term loan agreement to August 14, 2023. Please refer to our earnings presentation for details. At the end of the quarter, total liquidity was $4.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion, undrawn revolver capacity of $2.25 billion and an unused delayed draw term loan facility of $600 million. Before I cover guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll discuss our business outlook. For fiscal first quarter, sequentially, we expect both HDD and Flash revenue to be relatively stable. In fiscal first quarter, we are continuing to adjust production to better match demand and anticipate underutilization charges to impact both HDD and Flash gross margins along with product mix pressures on flash ASP. Beyond the fiscal first quarter, we anticipate both HDD and Flash revenue to improve through the remainder of fiscal year 2024, driven by normalizing demand in storage as well as higher average content per unit in Flash. Gross margin is expected to gradually improve, driven by higher HDD volume and lower underutilization charges in both Flash and HDD. We will continue to tightly manage our cost structure and expenses as we navigate the challenging environment. For fiscal year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to decline significantly. I'll now turn to guidance. For the fiscal first quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.75 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 2.5% and 4.5%, which includes underutilization charges across Flash and HDD totaling $200 million to $220 million. We expect operating expenses to be between $570 million to $590 million. Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect income tax expense to be between $30 million and $40 million for the fiscal first quarter and $130 million to $170 million for fiscal year 2024. We expect the loss per share of $1.80 to $2.10, assuming approximately 323 million shares outstanding. I will now turn the call back over to David.David V. GoeckelerThanks, Wissam. Let me just wrap up. Fiscal year 2023 marked a period of exceptional progress in strategic planning for Western Digital. We diligently optimize our operations and executed our innovative product road map, priming ourselves for greater profitability as demand inevitably rebounds across Hard Drives and Flash. As we move forward, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities and deliver continued success. Before opening up for Q&amp;A, I would like to take a moment to recognize Siva Sivaram, our esteemed President of Technology and Strategy. Siva will be leaving Western Digital to pursue a great leadership opportunity in a different technology domain. Siva has made significant contributions to Western Digital and SanDisk over the past 10 years, and he's a wonderful friend. We wish him all the best going forward. Peter, let's start the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is going to come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreGreat. I wonder if you could talk to NAND in the current quarter. looks like the underutilization charges are similar. Does that mean your utilization is unchanged? And I guess, it seems like you're able to make some inventory progress, does that mean that you can, at some point, have line of sight to bringing that back up?David V. GoeckelerYes. Joe, thanks for the question. NAND, in the current quarter, as we said, we saw good -- I guess, good market reaction in consumer and in the client business, both returned to growth on an exabyte basis. They both were sequential growers. So we saw incremental upside there. So we were happy about that. We are still underutilizing the fab. I'll let Wissam talk about that in a little bit more detail. We do plan to underutilize for another couple of quarters. But we feel good about the overall. The signs in the overall market price declines are moderating. Our inventory is down bit shipments are up. We expect bit shipments to be up again double digits next quarter. So not quite where we want to be yet, but the market is stabilizing, and we see a lot of good things -- a lot of metrics going in the right direction.Wissam G. JabreYes, Joe. And with respect to underutilization, we saw similar type of underutilization charges in fiscal Q4 versus Q3 for the Flash side. And when you look at HDD, we had a bit of more underutilization. But sticking with Flash, also in our guidance, we've noted similar levels into fiscal Q1, albeit if you look at sort of the range of $200 million to $220 million, I would say, it is split 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And also, we're -- if I think of, let's say, the fiscal Q2, I anticipate more or less similar levels of underutilization from where we stand today.Joseph Lawrence MooreGreat. And if I could just follow up. In terms of the uses of cash in the next few quarters, I know you've got the convert that comes due early next year. I think there's still some issues about a potential tax payment. Can you just update us there and sort of do you need to raise money to pay those out?Wissam G. JabreSo with respect to uses of cash, as you noted, we do have the convert that matures in February '24, and we plan to address that this quarter or the next one. We also have the IRS settlement that is coming up, and we expect also this payment to be very likely this quarter. But with respect to liquidity exiting fiscal Q4, we had approximately $4.9 billion of liquidity. And so if you recall, the delayed drawn term loan was put in place in the event we need to address the IRS settlement. So that will be drawn down to take care of the IRS settlement when it happens. And with respect to the convert, I mentioned, we'll address it in the coming 2 quarters.OperatorNext question is going to come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.Christopher James MuseI guess this question, from a supply perspective, we haven't seen a initiative you're seeing. So how would you think about a return to kind of demand normalization over the next 6, 9 and 12 months?David V. GoeckelerOkay. That was CJ, right? CJ, that was very -- it was a little tough to hear you there, but I think we got the gist of the question, which was supply-demand normalization. Is that right in Flash?Christopher James MuseYes. Sorry about that. Yes.David V. GoeckelerNo, that's all right. Okay. So look, I think, as I said, a number of things we saw in the market this quarter. We saw sequential bit growth overall. We saw client and consumer returning to exabyte growth on a year-over-year basis. Consumer SSD, content up 40%. Client SSD up 20%. We saw our inventory down. We think in the consumer and client markets, PC markets basically shipping to demand at this point. We expect our -- for the fiscal year, we saw our bits about flat year-over-year. For the calendar year, we see them down low single digits. We probably see the industry down a little lower than that. So we're taking the actions to bring supply and demand better into balance. And I think we're seeing that across our markets. Cloud is still -- there's still a couple of quarters ago there. That's a larger story. But in our 2 biggest markets for Flash, we're seeing that supply-demand balance start to move closer together, put it that way.Christopher James MuseSecond question, the strategic review, you announced (inaudible). So I think there was a hope that maybe there might be some (inaudible) underneath that thing. How should we (inaudible)?David V. GoeckelerOkay. I think that was a strategic review and timing, CJ. So like the process is active. We look forward to talking more about it when we reach a conclusion.OperatorOur next question is going to come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.Unidentified AnalystThis is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask how are you guys thinking with the recent uptick in AI investment in the data center? How do you think that impacts the mix of flash relative to HDD capacity being deployed? Or maybe how that will impact you going forward? And then kind of related to that, with how -- or can you guys just give us an update on where you stand with your enterprise SSD qualifications?David V. GoeckelerYes. I've been thinking a lot about generative AI. It's clearly a big topic these days. And obviously, a lot of spend going on to build out the infrastructure in the cloud, which I think, quite frankly, is a great thing. The cloud distribution model of new technology is something that is amazing that's been built out over the last decade, so we all get access to this technology very rapidly. And when I think about this in the storage domain, clearly, the compute infrastructure is being built out now, but we're all going to be enabled with are like incredible tools to automate data creation at many different levels, whether it's tax data, video data, whatever it happens to be. I think that we're essentially going to really accelerate our ability, all of us to create information that needs to be stored. So I see this as kind of a catalyst for just a profound increase in the amount of data creation. I think that once those tools get distributed and we all start using them, I think that drives incremental growth across SSDs and hard drives. I mean, hard drives are the foundational storage in the cloud. It's going to be that way for a very long time. So while gen AI may have some disruptions on the business in the near term as the compute infrastructure gets built out, very optimistic that this is a -- as I said, I think it's a profound -- it's a catalyst for a profound increase in the rate of data creation. So quite excited about that. We don't know exactly what -- how you model that just yet, except that there's new innovation drives new data creation, which drives the need for storage. So we look forward as these -- as this infrastructure gets built out and rapidly adopted the impact it's going to have on our business. Now on enterprise SSD, we still have the qualifications. We've recently qualified BiCS5 in some of these places. That market, along with nearline HDD or capacity enterprise HDD is depressed right now or subdued. So we're not seeing a lot of growth in that. But we fully expect that when that market comes back and that part of cloud infrastructure spending comes back that we'll be in a good position. We're still investing in the products and feel good about the position we have with the major cloud vendors.OperatorOur next question is going to come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays.Thomas James O'MalleyI just I wanted to narrow in on the HDD side. There's been a variance of timing of recovery across the industry. Could you just give us your latest when you think the cloud portion of your HDD business is going to recover? I know you previously have said the fourth quarter. Has there been any pushout in that expectation? And could you also just comment on the health I know it's down this quarter, but just the health of that HDD business as you're seeing it today. So just the timing of the recovery and how it's turning today.David V. GoeckelerYes. I think as we move -- so first of all, we think we're going to see sequential exabyte growth in capacity enterprise HDD throughout the fiscal year, but it's going to be towards the end of the year into the first quarter where we start to get line of sight to all of the customers coming back. I think we're having discussions across all of our customers about what they're -- we always have conversations. But some of the ones have been in inventory digestion for quite a while. So we're getting better line of sight to the end of that. But I think we still have a couple of quarters to go, but improving I think next quarter, things will be stable. It will be a mix impact there. We expect Client to be a little bit more challenged than this quarter. But I think as we move throughout the year, things will get better, and I think your timing of a couple more quarters of getting through this phase. And as we get into early next year, we expect things to look better.Thomas James O'MalleyHelpful. And then also on the HDD business, your competitor kind of talked about being more aggressive in certain areas on pricing. Have you guys also look to be more aggressive on pricing? And any comments that you have on just your strategy with clients on the pricing side?David V. GoeckelerYes, pricing really starts with innovation. I mean, I think that's where we're staging our UltraSMR product. We're really, really happy with where UltraSMR is at ePMR opting in, and we're already staging our next product for growth there. That's the underpinnings of where we're able to bring a better TCO proposition to our customers. And as we do that, we're able to share in the benefits of that as those drives gets deployed. The rest of the market is more market-driven pricing. We have a lot of different channels, a lot of different markets we sell into, and that type of pricing is just -- is more what you would typically think in any big market around supply and demand.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen.Krish Sankar(inaudible) in June was down on sequence of your peers, just spoke that pricing should improve after -- or revenue should improve after December. Is that a function of overall NAND getting better or your specific exposure to retail and PCs that's helped (inaudible)? And then I have a follow-up.David V. GoeckelerI missed the first part of the question.Wissam G. JabreSorry, Krish, can you please repeat?David V. GoeckelerYou didn't have a great -- there's a little bit of static on the line.Krish SankarI apologize. I was just trying to (inaudible) the pricing in June. We spoke about the revenue improvement. Is is a function of NAND pricing improving what your targeted retail and PC is going to get better?David V. GoeckelerOkay. Let me -- I think I got it at that time. So NAND pricing. So first of all, in the last quarter, NAND price, you saw like-for-like pricing down 9%, blended down 6%, so moderating from the quarter before. Next quarter, we expect volume to pick up, which will drive volume pick up margin to be impacted a little bit more from where it is today. So continue to moderate, but volume picking up. Does that help answer your question? I don't know if I didn't get all of your question, Krish, so I'm sorry if I'm not answering it.Krish SankarNo, no, I think it does. It does. I was just trying to figure out you specific end vertical, which is PCs and retail.David V. GoeckelerI got you. So on -- as we said, we saw the client and consumer markets return to growth, exabyte growth and sequential revenue growth. So we see those markets have kind of through their inventory digestion and more shipping to end demand. So that we expect that to continue as we go forward.Krish SankarGot it. And then a quick follow-up on hard drive. You said that you're sampling the 8-terabyte ePMR. Is the 26 terabyte ePMR still on the road map? And are you like doing that by increasing the number of disks per drive? And how do you think about the gross margin (inaudible) to terabyte?David V. GoeckelerOkay. So let me -- again, I think I got most of the question. So we're not adding more disk. I mean, UltraSMR, it's a combination of our OptiNAND and UltraSMR technology. It's the next step on the road map. I think we've talked a lot over the last year plus about this driving from 20 to 30 plus with a set of technologies around ePMR, OptiNAND, UltraSMR. And this is the next step in that road map. We still have a couple of more steps to go. So we'll announce the products one at a time, but we're happy with where we are and continue to drive innovation. And as demand comes back, we'll be ramping into a great set of products. And these are products that can be staged quickly and ramp in volumes very quickly, very established technology. And the 26 T drive UltraSMR drive, we really -- that sold at scale this quarter, and we expect a significant growth in that in the next quarter as well.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Wamsi MohanSo we've had a few head fakes on recovery in the -- on the cloud side, particularly in HDDs. And wondering, as you think through sort of this improvement starting in fiscal 2Q. What's underpinning some of the confidence the demand recovery are you seeing particular signs from customers that are pointing to that. And your primary competitor also noted taking some changes, including a build-to-order philosophy. Curious if you guys are contemplating any such changes? And I have a follow-up.David V. GoeckelerWamsi. So first of all, yes, I mean, you hit it. I mean we have ongoing and very significant conversations with our customers on many quarters out. So that's what gives us -- that's what underpins the view we have. To your point, things can change, but that's the current view. And the conversations are productive and positive. On the build-to-order comment, look, I think the industry is going to come out of the -- well, let me speak about us. So Western Digital will come out of this downturn. It's a pretty severe downturn in a cyclical industry. But we've done a lot of things that I think the business is going to be different on the other side of this. First of all, we've taken significant amount of capacity out of the system. We've talked about the shift from client to capacity enterprise, at least as long as I've been here and it's been going on for many, many years before that. I think that transition is going to be essentially done. There's a long tail on any technology. But if you look -- on the unit basis, we'll come out of this with significant less spending on our infrastructure. We'll have the lowest fixed cost we've had in a decade plus in our HDD infrastructure and will really be focused exclusively on that client enterprise business going forward. That's not a -- we'll still have a client business. Don't get me wrong. It's still going to be there. Like I said, there's a long tail of technology. But I think as part of that, the industry will come out and we will come out of this as more of a build the order, if you will, as opposed to a build to forecast. So that's why we're having these conversations with our customers because it is a it is a long build time on an HDD, and we want to make sure that we've got the infrastructure in place. We've got the components in place, and we're running the right process to deliver what our customers need at the right time. So I think that maybe the short answer to your question is yes, Western Digital will be -- is going to more of that kind of process.Wamsi MohanOkay. Dave, and just a clarification on the underutilization charges, which look roughly flattish quarter-on-quarter. Are those charges roughly similar in flash and HDD this past quarter? Or are there different moving pieces underlying that for September?Wissam G. JabreSure, Wamsi. So when you look at the September quarter, the guide at $200 million to $220 million of underutilization charges and they're split roughly 70% Flash, 30% HDD. And I would -- just to clarify also to add with respect probably to the following quarter. I expect -- sorry, underutilization related charges to be let's say, 5% to 10% down and most of the -- if not all of the decrease would be coming from HDD.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.Shek Ming HoI wanted to ask about the cloud weakness again. I understand the cloud things could be lumpy. But curious about your conversations with the large hyperscale guys. How has that changed around a quarter ago? Are they giving you signals about when inventory will start stabilizing? Are they worried about supply in the second half given production cuts by all the suppliers? And are they more receptive to purchase commitments?David V. GoeckelerYes. What I would say is the it's always a very robust conversation given the amount of business we do with the hyperscalers. It's clear that some of them have been in a very severe inventory digestion phase and kind of took a pause on buying anything, but we're back to having conversations with those customers. I mean, they're still growing. And storage is still being created and growing. So we expect those conversations in those businesses to the buying will reemerge and we're having the conversations on when that will happen and in what magnitude just to make sure that we've got all of our capacity aligned to deliver that. I think we're getting very good reception on the product road map. As we talked about our 22, 24, 26 terabyte platform and products have now been qualified by all of the major cloud vendors. We're just -- we expect to ramp those significantly, especially the 26 T next quarter. That's really becoming a major capacity point for some of the biggest cloud builders. And right on the back of that, we're launching a 28 T UltraSMR drive. So the conversations are strong, and it's about making sure we have clear alignment on what their requirements are going to be and that we get the proper manufacturing in place to deliver on that.Shek Ming HoOkay. Maybe a quick follow-up on the Hard Drive side. Clearly, you guys have been better than the competitor last quarter. But I just want to hone in on the SMR drives, which you said have qualified at all major cloud customers. Can you give us an idea what SMR adoption is today and where you think it will be in a few quarters from now?David V. GoeckelerSMR, it's very idiosyncratic. I mean the intersection of adoption and inventory digestion makes it very lumpy. And if you look at the current quarter or last quarter, but I can say going forward that several of the major cloud providers are standardizing on an SMR deployment, UltraSMR for us, and we expect have a significant ramp of that technology over the next several quarters.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariI had one clarification and then a question. David, on NAND ASPs for the current quarter, I guess you talked about bids being up double digits sequentially, and you're kind of guiding revenue to flat sequentially. So I guess, the implied ASPs are down perhaps a little bit more than what they were down in the June quarter, but you talked about moderation. So is the sharper price decline in September that's implied in guidance or embedded in guidance, primarily a function of mix? Or am I missing something there?David V. GoeckelerYes. It may be a little bit -- sequentially, maybe a little bit lower than what you're modeling. So I think that's where it is. Toshiya, we can follow up with you on kind of more details, but I think that's probably the clarification.Toshiya HariOkay. Got it. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Wissam. You mentioned that for fiscal '24, you plan to cut CapEx significantly. Curious if it's purely impacting your capacity decisions in NAND? Or are there any changes or shifts to how you think about the road map? And related to that, I think on a bit shipments, David, you mentioned for calendar '24, you guys are going to be, I think, down low single digits. But how should we think about bit production in calendar '24, given the CapEx and production cuts that you're going through right now?Wissam G. JabreWell, maybe let me first start with the first part of the question on CapEx, Toshiya. The comment on CapEx is -- well, when you look at calendar -- sorry, fiscal '23, we've taken quite a bit of CapEx from our plans as we continue to preserve cash. I mean you can see that we've spent, I think, year-on-year, we're down roughly 30% to 35%. And it's almost $1 billion lower than -- at the gross CapEx level, almost $1 billion lower than what our plan was at the beginning of the year for fiscal '23. For fiscal '24, we're projecting to be significantly lower. It's mostly in line -- it doesn't impact necessarily our product road map. It is more or less what we see today relative to what our NAND or basically other types of investments, meaning no the transitions or other types of investments planned. And so I wouldn't say there's any major change relative to what we've already been planning. But given the dynamic macro environment we're operating in, we will continue to monitor, just like we've done in fiscal '23 on a quarterly basis and adjust as needed.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.Shannon Siemsen CrossI'm wondering, you have any unique perspective having both HDDs and SSDs. There's commentary coming out of Pure, and I'm hearing more from some of the other storage vendors of a growing use of or cloud within data -- or sorry, growing use of SSDs within cloud and data centers and almost like a potential secular shift. Again, Pure takes it kind of to the extreme. But I'm just wondering how you think about how the mix will trend over time, maybe layer in AI, if you want? And just think about (inaudible) we should worry about what are you hearing from your customers? And then I have a follow-up.David V. GoeckelerShannon, thanks for the question. We've talked about this a lot over the years. I think that both technologies are growing in the data center. HDD is the predominant storage mechanism in the data center we don't expect that to change. Our customers don't expect that to change. As long as we continue to drive the HCD road map forward, we just -- we're ramping 26 terabyte. We're already launching 28 terabytes. So we're moving forward with capacity points on HDD. And we expect robust growth of HDD storage in the data center going forward. We also expect growth of enterprise SSD storage in the data center going forward. It's probably growing a little bit faster than HDD, but not in a way where you're looking at one is a substitute for the other. They're highly complementary technologies, and we expect that to be the case for any useful planning horizon in the future. We look at a decade out. The cost differences are still significant, and that's certainly the way we talk to our customers about how they're building mass scale data centers.Shannon Siemsen CrossOkay. Great. And Wissam, can you talk a little bit about OpEx? How you're thinking about it relative to maybe a more normalized level? And how much loan for the model as revenues come back before you have to start spending more from an OpEx perspective?Wissam G. JabreYes, sure. So on OpEx, you saw we continue to manage it very, very tightly in fiscal Q4. We ended at $582 million, which is around $180 million lower than the same quarter last year. As to your question, over the near term, I think we're within sort of the range where we expect to be. But as the business starts coming back, there could be some small increase as we start layering up some of the variable expenses on that. However, we should never -- we shouldn't expect the increase in OpEx to be faster than the increase in revenue. And so we would be monitoring that, and it will be gradual. And similarly, if there's a need for us to take additional action on OpEx to continue to manage very tightly. We also have some room to do that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriI had 2, Wissam. The first one is on underutilization charges. And it's kind of like a 2-part question. So the first is what's the current utilization in NAND? And then on the HDD side, is there kind of a mild post as to where these could start to go away? Because you're guiding $70 million for September for underutilization in HDD. It sounds like it goes to maybe 60 to 65 in December quarter. But when does it go away because you started to take underutilization charges. I think when HDD revenue went sub $2 billion per quarter. So do we have to get all the way back to $2 billion a quarter to have those HDD underutilization charges go away?Wissam G. JabreOkay. So Tim, with respect to the Flash side, we continue to make these decisions on an ongoing basis. And from the numbers, you can tell the underutilization related charges were are projected to be roughly flat from Q4 to Q1. As for HDD, I think the math is -- your math on Q1 is close to where the guidance is. But I think in the December quarter, think of the underutilization charges going, let's say, from Q1 to Q2 going down 5% or 10% and all of that decrease coming from HDD, you start seeing some declines basically in the HDD underutilization in the December quarter. And based on what we see today, it's a bit too early to talk about the second half of the fiscal year 2024. But to the point you were making around the $2 billion revenue mark, we don't need to get to the $2 billion revenue mark to really fully utilize our capacity. If you recall, we've restructured quite a bit of our manufacturing capacity in the Hard Drive business, and we continue to take and optimize that fixed cost aspect of the cost structure. And so we can be fully utilized at a lower level than $2 billion, given the current cost structure.Timothy Michael ArcuriAnd then just on the debt service cost. So you have the convert due in February. I think that's at a pretty good rate. I think it's at 1.5%. So the debt you're going to replace that with, I imagine, is going to be pretty expensive. So it seems sort of -- I guess my question is sort of where does that leave you in the cap structure? Obviously, it seems like debt service costs are going to go up maybe $20 million a quarter once you have to issue new debt for that. So can you just talk about sort of how you solve for all that?Wissam G. JabreSo yes, the current rate on the convert is 1.5%. And given where the interest rate environment is today, I would expect that to be replaced by that -- when replaced by that to be roughly more expensive than that. So look, it's a little bit too early to talk about it in a lot of details, but this is something that is definitely a focus for us as we think through the various options that are available to us. With respect to refinancing, for instance, we look at the potential cost of capital and our goal is to make sure that we maintain a lower cost of capital to the extent possible. But I expect it to be slightly up from here, all said.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.Ananda Prosad BaruahYes. Thanks, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. really just -- 2 quick ones, if I could. When would you expect terabyte and maybe I'll even through 28 in there since you mentioned it, David, there each crossover. And then I just have a quick follow-up to that.David V. GoeckelerCrossover as -- look, let me say that -- there's a lot of -- there's multiple different capacity points. So I think we need to maybe talk about this a little bit different. It doesn't just move from 1, '16, '18, maybe like it did 2, 3 years ago. Now there's a bit of distribution of different customers and what kind of technologies they're using, whether it's 20 or 22 or 26 or going to 28 or even some 24. So as I look at where things are going to be in the next couple of quarters, you're going to see a pretty even distribution across 3 or 4 different capacity points, all of them shipping 0.5 million or more drive. So we expect a very substantial ramp of 26. I don't want to take away from the ramp that's going to happen there. It's going to be very quick and very rapid now that it's qualified and getting close to being a leading capacity point in the next couple of quarters.Ananda Prosad BaruahThanks for making the distinction. That's actually really helpful. And the follow-up is, do you guys have any view yet, any opinion, on when things normalize out in hard drives, if the hyperscalers return to what their classic utilization levels have been historically, how they run the capacity? Or do you think they settle in somewhat different on the utilization?David V. GoeckelerLook, I think anytime you go through a period like this, there's some work done on optimization of the infrastructure and consolidation, I think that's happening. But I would expect things -- you go through that and you just incrementally get better. Like anything in technology, you're constantly improving, constantly getting more efficient. I think that, that is something that's always going to go on and we're still going to see the growth in exabytes on top of that. So I think we're still looking at 20%, 25% exabyte growth in the HDD business. And I think we clearly haven't seen that in the last year, but we know it's a cyclical business, and we expect to get back to those levels.OperatorAnd our last question is going to come from the line of Karl Ackerman, before we have a short statement by our CEO.Karl AckermanCould you discuss how we should think about a recovery in nearline units and unit pricing as you and your peer implement a build-to-order process? And as you address that question, can you discuss how this build-to-order process may differ from long-term agreements signed in 2021 that were a bit challenging to implement over time?David V. GoeckelerSo units, I expect to recover, right? I mean we're going to get exabyte growth. We're at a low point on units. We expect units to recover and get back to where they were and eclipse that actually as we continue to get exabyte growth. I'll put in say, a once again, I am very excited about generative AI. I know everybody is. But I think it's going to come to our world on storage once all this gets deployed. And so I expect to see units recover. I think the build-to-order process is going to be a fairly straightforward process because we have deep relationships with set of customers here. It's a big market. It's a big relationship. And I think it's just getting the business model to a place where there's better alignment between the infrastructure we have in place. Again, we've been talking about this for many years now that in a lot of ways, cloud has significantly benefited from the reduction in client and there's been a consistent availability of infrastructure to build hard drives. And we're at the end of that transition now, so we have to just have more planning around that. I think the long-term agreements were a step into that. I think this is maybe the next step into how do we run our franchise to make sure we've got the best alignment between delivering a great product and value proposition to our customers, which is extremely important, the storage is an incredibly important part of the data center and making sure that we have the right infrastructure in place to fuel that growth. So I expect it to be a pretty natural change or evolution of the business model, and I expect it to be very positive on all sides.All right, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Take care.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.78 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of hard drives for businesses and personal computers would post a loss of $1.55 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.37, delivering a surprise of 11.61%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Western Digital , which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $2.67 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.53 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Western Digital shares have added about 33.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.3%.What's Next for Western Digital?While Western Digital has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Western Digital: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

We expect premiums to rise 2.5% to $2.5 billion.  The Unum U.S. segment is likely to have benefited from favorable benefits experience in group product lines, sable performance at supplemental and voluntary lines, disciplined sales trends, strong persistency in group lines and growth of new product lines.

However, an active catastrophe environment and continued inflationary pressures are likely to have dampened growth prospects for insurers. Some of the insurers, including The Allstate Corporation ALL, Aflac Incorporated AFL, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial, Inc. PRU and Unum Group UNM, are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Aug 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for second-quarter 2023 are anticipated to rise 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. These companies’ revenues are anticipated to improve 7.4% year over year.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q2Revenues of insurance companies are likely to have benefited from an expanding premium base, which resulted from continued rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the second quarter. Growing premiums bode well for insurers as they account for a significant chunk to their top line.The commercial property insurance rates in the United States witnessed an increase of 10.7% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, MarketScout. According to the same source, rate increases in general liability and inland marine insurance lines registered rate increases of 7% and 5%, respectively, in the second quarter. A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue an M&amp;A strategy to build diversified portfolios, which is likely to have minimized concentration risks and boosted the sale of insurance policies in the second quarter. Higher policy sales might fetch higher premiums to insurers.Story continuesHowever, an active catastrophe environment is expected to have created roadblocks for insurers’ underwriting results in the to-be-reported quarter. Per JP Morgan analysts, insured losses from major natural catastrophes are likely to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter, with the majority of such losses stemming from storms in June. Despite its associated share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. Insurers are also equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses.For insurers having exposure to rate-sensitive products, an improved interest rate environment is expected to have boosted their investment yields in the second quarter. An aging U.S. population might have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers, fetching steady premium flows.A higher number of cars plying on roads as a result of receding pandemic effects is likely to have boosted auto premiums of insurers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, persistent inflationary headwinds and uninterrupted claim expenses might have exerted strain on the profits of auto insurers.The resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing is expected to have provided an impetus to the demand for worker compensation insurance coverage in the second quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in light of a booming digital era, which are expected to have accelerated claim payments and automated processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the second quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

19,479d133d-6e62-32d6-bfcc-4c87637072f0,STT,2023-08-01,State Street (STT) Rides on Expansion Efforts Amid Expense Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-street-stt-rides-expansion-142600743.html,1690813560,STORY,['STT'],"[State Street Corporation STT is poised for growth on the back of business servicing wins, synergies from strategic buyouts, a global footprint and high interest rates. However, persistently elevated expenses and a challenging operating backdrop that is likely to hamper fee income growth are major headwinds.State Street has witnessed a decent increase in net interest revenues (NIR) on the back of higher interest rates. NIR recorded a three-year (ended 2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5%. Net interest margin (NIM) also expanded to 1.03% in 2022 from 0.74% in 2021 and 0.97% in 2020. With the Federal Reserve expected to keep rates high in the near term, the company’s NIR and NIM are anticipated to benefit from the same. However, rising funding costs and a decline in non-interest-bearing deposit balance are expected to weigh on both metrics. We project NIR to rise 3.1% this year, and NIM to be 1.14% for 2023.State Street is continuing with its efforts to strengthen fee income sources. The company’s total fee revenues witnessed a three-year (2019-2022) CAGR of 1.6%. Further, it recorded $3.6 trillion in business servicing wins in 2022 across client segments and regions. Moreover, at the end of the second quarter of 2023, servicing assets to be installed in future periods totaled $2.4 trillion.The company remains well-positioned with respect to fundamental business activities, given its global exposure and a broad array of innovative products and services (including the launch of State Street Digital and State Street Alpha). These, along with business servicing wins and inorganic growth strategy, are expected to keep supporting fee revenues.While we project total fee income to decline 1.8% in 2023, the same is expected to rebound with 1.7% and 6.5% year-over-year growth in 2024 and 2025, respectively.State Street has been expanding its scale by undertaking strategic acquisitions. In March, the company announced an agreement to acquire CF Global Trading to further expand outsourced trading capabilities. In 2021, it acquired Mercatus to provide a fully integrated platform to institutional investors for growing private market segments. These, along with past buyouts, are expected to continue resulting in revenues and cost synergies and help the company expand its footprint across the globe.However, elevated operating expenses are expected to continue to hurt State Street’s bottom line. The total non-interest expenses grew in the first half of 2023. Although the company has successfully managed expenses through high-cost location, workforce reduction and restructuring initiatives, overall costs are likely to remain elevated due to higher Information systems and communications expenses. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses reflect a CAGR of 5% over the next three years.State Street’s largest source of revenues is fee income, which constituted more than 80% of total revenues in the first half of 2023. Concentration risk emanating from higher dependence on fee-based revenues could significantly alter the company’s financial position, if there is any change in individual investment preferences, regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 22.9% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBanks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked bank stocks are JPMorgan JPM and Pathward Financial, Inc.

Originating several millennia ago in Mesopotamia, perfumes remain significant to our daily lives today. The Egyptians, Greeks, French, and Arabs all developed their unique versions of fragrances. Perfumes have evolved from simplistic extracts, usually from single flowers, to complex and distinctive undertones and notes. The long and persistent history of fragrances implies their demand is here to stay. Post-pandemic, people have started to invest more money in self-care and wellness products. There has been an upsurge in sales of perfumes as well. According to an article published by Forbes, Perfume sales increased 6% in 2021 compared to 2019. In 2020, China Briefing claims that China earned $1.76 million from its perfume sales. This massive revenue accounted for only 2.5% of the global perfume market. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, in 2022, the international perfume industry had a market size of $45.85 billion and it is estimated to grow from $48.05 billion in 2023 to $69.25 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.36%.Perfumes can make a person feel attractive, boost confidence, and leave an impression. Fragrance is associated with better hygiene. People also link scents with memories. Thus, buyers often form an emotional connection with their favorite perfumes. People repurchase the same fragrance over and over again if they have specified it as their signature scent. The perfume brands are adapting to the changing consumer demands. For example, Maison 21G has advanced innovation in the perfume industry by incorporating AI into its product design. Maison 21G enables consumers to make their unique scent. The sustainable brand provides customers with Eaux de Parfum with a minimum of 21% of the concentration. These creative markers set Maison 21G apart from other new brands present in the market. Story continuesNotable Names In The Perfume IndustryThe fragrance industry is very dynamic and is constantly updating the available options.

DLA is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 3, after market close. The bottom line of this designer and manufacturer of activewear and lifestyle apparel is expected to have decreased year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents per share for the fiscal third quarter has remained unchanged in the past 30 days. This is in contrast to earnings of 88 cents per share in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $116.2 million, indicating a fall of 8.4% from the prior-year reported figure.This Duluth, GA-based company has a negative trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 56.8%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 108.3%.Key Things to NoteDelta Apparel’s quarterly results are likely to have reflected the impacts of a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures. In addition, DLA has been encountering cost-related hurdles for a while now. The elevated cotton, energy, dyes and chemicals, freight and labor costs have been concerning.The company has also been witnessing certain demand-related headwinds in its mass retail channel. These weaknesses and any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to have hurt Delta Apparel’s performance during the quarter under review.On the flip side, the company has been focused on boosting growth at the DTG2Go division and improving profitability in its activewear business. Delta Apparel’s Global Brands and Retail Direct channels have been performing well. The company has been building its brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels to aid overall growth.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Delta Apparel this time around.

This, along with a concentrated loan portfolio, are major headwinds. Nonetheless, higher interest rates, strategic buyouts and decent loan demand offer some support.USB continues to record a rise in non-interest expenses. The metric has witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% over the last four years (2019-2022). The rise was mainly due to higher merger and integration charges, compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expenses, as well as technology and communications expenditures. The rising trend continued in first half of 2023 as well.Management estimates to incur $1.4 billion in costs for the Union Bank integration. In fact, it expects to incur $900 million-$1 billion of such costs in 2023. Further, it projects non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) to reach around $17 billion in 2023. Hence, USB’s cost base remains relatively high, which is likely to hinder bottom-line growth.Apart from increasing costs, lack of diversification in loan portfolio amid an uncertain economy is likely to act as a headwind. Around 50.4% of USB’s loan portfolio comprises of commercial loans (commercial and commercial real estate lending) as of Jun 30.Further, U.S. Bancorp continues to encounter investigations and lawsuits from the investors and regulators, leading to increased legal expenses and provisions in the near term.Analysts also seem pessimistic regarding USB’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 and 2024 earnings has been revised marginally lower over the past seven days. USB currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Over the past six months, shares of USB have plunged 19.6% compared with the industry's decline of 5.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the above-mentioned concerns, U.S. Bancorp is well placed to grow organically, driven by a decent rise in loan demand and higher rates. Further, a solid balance-sheet position enables the company to pursue opportunistic buyouts. These efforts will support revenue growth going forward. Management expects adjusted total revenues to reach $28-$29 billion in 2023.Story continuesBank Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the banking space are Mercantile Bank MBWM and South Atlantic Bancshares SABK, each sporting a Zanks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

A new report from Nerdwallet estimates that back-to-school shopping will cost parents $600 on average per child this year. As Nerdwallet Senior Writer Kimberly Palmer explains, because of higher prices, ""back-to-school shopping is really putting a lot of financial strain on parents this year."" Palmer joins Yahoo Finance Live to give some tips that parents can use to keep costs down.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: With August just around the corner, literally tomorrow, parents will be preparing their kids to head back to school and the price tag that comes with it. The National Retail Federation says inflation may cause 2023 to be the most expensive year yet, with spending estimated to surpass $135 billion.NerdWallet estimates it will cost about $600 on average per child and found many parents will have to dip into savings or go into debt to afford it. Kimberly Palmer is a senior writer at NerdWallet and joins us now. Kimberly, thanks so much for joining us. Let's dig into this data that you all called. First, what is expected to be the priciest thing in terms of back to school purchases this year?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, in general, back to school shopping is really putting a lot of financial strain on parents this year. Because prices are higher, you still need to fulfill that list that you get from schools. And the priciest items tend to be things like electronics. A lot of kids need computers, graphing calculators. As you get older, the items just get more expensive. And then, of course, kids also want things like backpacks, clothing, and all of that adds up really quickly.SEANA SMITH: Kimberly, how is this then I guess affected some of the shopping attempts here or strategies, I should say, from parents in terms of where they're looking to save, when they are buying, has that shifted at all given the fact that so many parents are under financial pressure?Story continuesKIMBERLY PALMER: It has. Parents are really getting creative about how they're saving money this year. So first of all, they're being really careful to stick to the lists provided by the schools. So as soon as you get that school list, you can see that it is pretty limited because schools are mindful of the fact that parents are under so much financial strain.So your children might be asking you to buy more things off list, but you can absolutely stick to that list. Also check what items you already have around the house that might be that you bought extra binders last year and you can reuse them this year or reuse that backpack because that's another big ticket item.I think one of the most creative strategies that I've heard of is parents teaming up with each other because in a lot of cases you can buy in bulk together and then share the cost and then that can make your overall budget a little bit easier.DIANE KING HALL: And Kimberly, I want to ask you about something that we've talked about here and you are a parent as well, I know. So what's a way to get around some of these pricier things? I know there are certain days, for instance, you can shop on. What's your tip there?KIMBERLY PALMER: There are. So the biggest tip is that you want to spread out your purchases. And some school systems make this a little easier for you by giving out those school shopping lists early in July. So some parents have actually already started shopping and took advantage of those July summer sales. But don't worry if you haven't, it's not too late because we'll see some pop up discounts.It's a lot of times based on your local district and when your kids are going back to school. So you want to check for those local sales. And then meanwhile, you want to think about spreading out your purchases too and even waiting until October for some of those items because kids don't need everything on day one. You can often wait to buy some things until second semester.And when it comes to clothing, especially fall clothing, you definitely want to try to wait to buy until we get a little closer to winter because the sales will be much better.SEANA SMITH: You can really-- actually, I had a question on that because the estimate that we have on the screen is that it's expected to exceed $600 per child. Does that include clothing?KIMBERLY PALMER: It does. So we actually ask families how much do you expect to spend this year on back to school shopping. And so that does include-- it goes beyond not just what the schools are requiring you to buy, but all of those other items as well. And yes, I have kids myself and I know they ask for much more than that's on the list. And so that's why it easily adds up.And some portion of parents actually say they'll spend over $1,000. So you can see how that becomes such a strain.DIANE KING HALL: Wow, oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. Over $1,000, I'm like, wow. Because when you go to the store for this stuff, yes, you can get the folders, the notebooks, et cetera, for cheaper. And especially, when you take your kids with you, they start, like, asking for things and that can add up if it's hard for you to say no.But talk to me about the tax holiday thing because some parents are newer to this, the list. Their kids are just starting out in school. What's the detail about that that parents should know about?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, the most important thing to know about tax holidays is that it's state-specific. So you want to check on what your state offers in terms of tax holidays because a lot of them come up in August. And you can actually take advantage of that for your back to school shopping.So you want to check what categories you're able to shop during that tax-free holiday and then go ahead and do that because you can really save some money there, and this year, every little bit helps.DIANE KING HALL: And what can people think about getting besides looking around to see what you have, but, like, second hand or something like that to help kind of keep these costs down, especially when we think about where inflation is now, Kemberly?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, one big trend this year actually is looking at refurbished items, so especially when you're looking at electronics. So anything like computers or graphing calculators, anything in that category, it's worth checking to see what refurbished options are available because you can save big. And that way your kids still have a great product, but you are not spending as much as you would otherwise on an all new product.SEANA SMITH: All right, Kimberly Palmer, great to get your perspective. Thanks so much for joining us here today.]"

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of 44 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents.MGM surpassed earnings estimates twice but missed the same twice in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 81%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the second quarter of 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS increased to 53 cents from 50 cents in the past 30 days. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported an adjusted EPS of 3 cents. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.76 billion, suggesting an increase of 15% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $3.27 billion.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise MGM Resorts International Price and EPS SurpriseMGM Resorts International price-eps-surprise | MGM Resorts International Quote Factors to NoteMGM’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from a strong Las Vegas market, international expansion and solid Sports betting and iGaming prospects. During the previous quarter, Las Vegas Strip Resorts' net income was $2,176.2 million, up 31% year over year. The uptick can be attributed to an increase in business volume, travel and the opening of The Cosmopolitan. During the quarter, net revenues from regional operations totaled $945.8 million, up 6% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Given a rebound in the convention business, the momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.For second-quarter 2023, our model predicts Las Vegas Strip and Regional operations’ revenues to grow 9.5% to $2,339.2 million and 2% to $978.9 million, respectively. We expect revenues from MGM China to increase 20.3% year over year to 172.1 million.Increased focus on Sports betting and iGaming is likely to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. As of March 2023, BetMGM achieved a market share of 28% in the iGaming and 17% in the U.S. sports betting space. During the first quarter, net gaming revenues from BetMGM came in at $476 million, up 76% from 2022 levels. Attributes such as robust player economics and a successful bonus optimization strategy added to the positives. Given the continued development progress and initiatives to improve the interface and customer experience, the momentum is likely to have continued in the second quarter.However, high costs are likely to have affected the company’s margins in the -to-be reported quarter.Per our model, expenses for rooms, casino and food and beverage in second-quarter 2023 are likely to increase 5.9%, 42% and 7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for MGM Resorts this time around.

(NYSE: NCLH) (together with NCL Corporation Ltd., “Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings”, “Norwegian”, “NCLH” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023 and provided guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023.Second Quarter 2023 Highlights:Company met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics in the second quarter.Generated total revenue of $2.2 billion, a record for the Company and up 33% compared to the same period in 2019, and GAAP net income of $86.1 million, or EPS of $0.20.Achieved Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $515 million and Adjusted EPS of $0.30, above guidance of $485 million and $0.25 respectively. Second quarter outperformance was driven by solid revenue performance, lower costs and favorable fuel pricing.Occupancy improved sequentially to approximately 105% in the quarter, in line with guidance and reflecting the completion of our phased ramp-up.Total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day increased approximately 15% both as reported and in constant currency, compared to the same period in 2019.Continued to demonstrate results of ongoing margin enhancement initiative including sequential improvement in operating costs. Gross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day was approximately $315 in the quarter. Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel per Capacity Day in constant currency was approximately $156, lower than the prior quarter and guidance of $159.Cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2023 continues to be at record levels and at higher pricing. The Company remains within its optimal booked position of approximately 60-65% on a 12-month forward basis.Advance ticket sales balance increased versus the prior quarter reaching a record $3.5 billion, approximately $167 million higher than prior quarter and 56% above the second quarter of 2019.$2.4 billion of liquidity at quarter-end, including boost from a $500 million return of cash collateral from a credit card processor.Full year 2023 Adjusted EPS guidance improved $0.05 to approximately $0.80 reflecting second quarter outperformance and continued strong results expected for the remainder of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA guidance improved to the range of $1.85 to $1.95 billion. Updated guidance reflects approximately $30 million of headwinds from higher interest and fuel expense for the back half of the year.Story continues“We are pleased to report strong second quarter results, in which we met or exceeded guidance on all key metrics, allowing us to improve our full year outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS,” said Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “The continued strength in the demand environment is evident not only in this quarter’s results, in which we generated a meaningful increase in pricing on 19% capacity growth compared to 2019, but also in our forward booked position which is within our optimal range and at higher pricing. As we look to the near future, we are focused on sustaining this momentum by capitalizing on the robust demand environment, strategically enhancing our guest experience, rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiative, building excitement for the upcoming launches of Norwegian Viva and Regent’s Seven Seas Grandeur and ultimately charting a path to reduce leverage and de-risk our balance sheet.”Business, Operations and Booking Environment Update Occupancy reached approximately 105% for the second quarter of 2023, in line with guidance and marking a significant milestone with the phased ramp-up now complete. Full year 2023 Occupancy is expected to average 103.5%, consistent with prior guidance. As expected, Occupancy in the quarter is slightly lower than the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the Company’s strategic shift to longer, more immersive itineraries. This shift naturally results in lower Occupancy levels and is expected to attract higher quality guests, generate higher Net Yields, improve guest satisfaction and cultivate stronger loyalty over time. As a result, full year Occupancy in 2024 and beyond is expected to be approximately 200 basis points lower relative to 2019.The Company continues to experience strong and resilient consumer demand. The cumulative booked position for the second half of 2023 is ahead of 2019 levels at continued higher pricing. On a 12-month forward basis, the Company continues to be in its optimal booked position of approximately 60-65%. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s advance ticket sales balance, including the long-term portion, was a record $3.5 billion, approximately $167 million higher than the prior quarter and approximately 56% higher than the second quarter of 2019. Onboard revenue generation remains robust with broad-based strength across all revenue streams. The Company continues to focus on increasing its pre-sold revenue from guests prior to sailing, as this typically results in higher overall spend throughout the cruise journey as well as earlier and more predictable cash inflow.Total revenue was up 33% in the second quarter versus 2019 with total revenue per Passenger Cruise Day up approximately 15% as reported and in constant currency. Gross margin per Capacity Day was approximately $116 in the quarter. Net Yield growth of approximately 2.9% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis was in line with guidance. The Company remains on track to achieve its healthy pricing guidance of Net Per Diem growth in the range of 9.0 to 10.5% and Net Yield growth in the range of 5.0 to 6.5% for the full year, both on a constant currency basis and compared to 2019.The Company continues to focus on efforts to maximize revenue opportunities and rightsize its cost base to strengthen the foundation for sustained, profitable growth. Gross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day was approximately $315 in the quarter, compared to $298 last quarter. Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel per Capacity Day in constant currency in the second quarter of 2023 was approximately $156, an improvement versus the first quarter and guidance of $159 as certain cost savings initiatives continued to be realized. Looking forward to the third quarter, the Company expects this metric to show further modest sequential improvement to approximately $152, or approximately $155 excluding certain non-recurring benefits expected in the quarter. The Company will continue to identify and evaluate a variety of initiatives to improve its cost structure and margin profile.Liquidity and Financial Recovery PlanThe Company continues to prioritize efforts to optimize its balance sheet and reduce leverage. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had a total debt position of $13.1 billion. The Company continues to expect to refinance its Operating Credit Facility by year-end. As of June 30, 2023, total Net Debt was $12.2 billion and the Company expects continued improvement in its Net Leverage.The Company’s liquidity was approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of approximately $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, $875 million of availability under its Revolving Loan Facility and a $650 million undrawn backstop commitment. The increase in liquidity versus prior quarter reflects the full return of approximately $500 million of cash collateral which was previously held in reserve by a credit card processor. The Company also has an incremental $300 million unsecured and undrawn commitment through January 2, 2024, which enhances future liquidity as it becomes available to draw on October 4, 2023. The Company continues to believe that its ongoing cash generation, fueled by its attractively financed newbuild growth pipeline, provides a path to meet its near-term liquidity needs, including its scheduled debt amortization payments and capital expenditures.“During the quarter, we achieved a second consecutive quarter of sequential operating cost improvement, demonstrating our commitment and relentless focus on improving efficiencies, reducing costs and restoring our margins in a strategic and data-driven manner while preserving the guest experience and superior service levels our brands are known for,” said Mark A. Kempa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “We were also pleased to have received approximately $500 million of cash collateral back from a credit card processor during the quarter, which not only provided a meaningful boost to our liquidity, bringing it to $2.4 billion at quarter-end, but is also a strong signal from our external partners of their increased confidence in our financial position and future outlook.”Second Quarter 2023 ResultsGAAP net income was $86.1 million or EPS of $0.20 compared to net loss of $(509.3) million or EPS of $(1.22) in the prior year. The Company reported Adjusted Net Income of $137 million or Adjusted EPS of $0.30 in the second quarter of 2023. This compares to Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EPS of $(478.3) million and $(1.14), respectively, in the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was approximately $515 million, better than guidance driven primarily by lower Adjusted Net Cruise Costs and lower fuel expense. This also marks the first quarter where Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the same quarter in 2019, a key milestone in the Company’s recovery efforts.Gross Cruise Costs per Capacity Day was approximately $315 in the quarter as reported and $316 in constant currency. Adjusted Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel per Capacity Day in constant currency was approximately $156, reflecting a decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023 as benefits from the Company’s ongoing margin enhancement initiative continue to be realized.Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, decreased to $715 from $836 in 2022. The Company reported fuel expense of $164 million in the period.Interest expense, net was $177.7 million in 2023 compared to $144.4 million in 2022. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of higher rates.Other income (expense), net was expense of $(8.0) million in 2023 compared to income of $31.0 million in 2022. In 2023, the expense primarily related to losses on foreign currency remeasurements.Outlook and Guidance In addition to announcing the results for the second quarter of 2023, the Company also provided guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023, along with accompanying sensitivities. The Company does not provide certain estimated future results on a GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future movement of foreign exchange rates or the future impact of certain gains and charges. These items are uncertain and will depend on several factors, including industry conditions, and could be material to the Company’s results computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not provided reconciliations between the Company’s 2023 guidance and the most directly comparable GAAP measures because it would be too difficult to prepare a reliable U.S. GAAP quantitative reconciliation without unreasonable effort.  2023 Guidance   Third Quarter 2023Full Year 20231  As ReportedConstant CurrencyAs ReportedConstant CurrencyNet Per Diem vs. 2019 6.50% to 7.50%7.00 to 8.00%8.50% to 10.00%9.00% to 10.50%Net Yield vs. 2019 1.75% to 2.75%2.25% to 3.25%4.50% to 6.00%5.00% to 6.50%Adjusted Net Cruise CostExcluding Fuel per Capacity Day Approx. $152.00Approx. $155.50Approx. $156.00Capacity Days Approx. 5.85 millionApprox. 22.7 millionOccupancy Approx. 106.0%Approx. 103.5%Adjusted EBITDA Approx. $730 million$1.85 to $1.95 billionAdjusted EPS2 Approx. $0.70Approx. $0.80Diluted Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding3 Approx. 510 million4Approx. 460 million4Depreciation and Amortization Approx. $205 millionApprox. $815 millionAdjusted Interest Expense, net5 Approx. $185 millionApprox. $720 millionEffect of a 1% change in Net Yield on Adjusted EBITDA / Adjusted EPS2 Approx. $18 millionApprox. $0.04Approx. $33 millionApprox. $0.07Effect of a $1 change in Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel per Capacity Day on Adjusted EBITDA / Adjusted EPS2 Approx. $6 millionApprox. $0.01Approx. $12 millionApprox. $0.03(1)Sensitivities for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are for the remainder of 2023.(2)Based on midpoint of guidance and using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 510 million for the third quarter of 2023 and 460 million for full year 2023 Adjusted EPS.

See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, and Net Per Diem to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe they are relevant measures of our revenue performance because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income (loss), we believe changes in Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.As our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the U.S., a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP measures on both a reported and Constant Currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income (loss) and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results.Net Leverage and Net Debt are performance measures that we believe provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other companies. Please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below.Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained, or incorporated by reference, in this release, including, without limitation, those regarding our business strategy, financial position, results of operations, plans, prospects, actions taken or strategies being considered with respect to our liquidity position, valuation and appraisals of our assets and objectives of management for future operations (including those regarding expected fleet additions, our expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions, our expectations regarding cruise voyage occupancy, the implementation of and effectiveness of our health and safety protocols, operational position, demand for voyages, plans or goals for our sustainability program and decarbonization efforts, our expectations for future cash flows and profitability, financing opportunities and extensions, and future cost mitigation and cash conservation efforts and efforts to reduce operating expenses and capital expenditures) are forward-looking statements. Many, but not all, of these statements can be found by looking for words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “intend,” “future” and similar words. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements. Examples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the impact of: adverse general economic factors, such as fluctuating or increasing levels of interest rates, inflation, unemployment, underemployment and the volatility of fuel prices, declines in the securities and real estate markets, and perceptions of these conditions that decrease the level of disposable income of consumers or consumer confidence; the spread of epidemics, pandemics and viral outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and their effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our results, operations, outlook, plans, goals, growth, reputation, cash flows, liquidity, demand for voyages and share price; implementing precautions in coordination with regulators and global public health authorities to protect the health, safety and security of guests, crew and the communities we visit and to comply with related regulatory restrictions; our indebtedness and restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity and be in compliance with maintenance covenants and otherwise limit our flexibility in operating our business, including the significant portion of assets that are collateral under these agreements; our ability to work with lenders and others or otherwise pursue options to defer, renegotiate, refinance or restructure our existing debt profile, near-term debt amortization, newbuild related payments and other obligations and to work with credit card processors to satisfy current or potential future demands for collateral on cash advanced from customers relating to future cruises; our need for additional financing or financing to optimize our balance sheet, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, and our outstanding exchangeable notes and any future financing which may be dilutive to existing shareholders; the unavailability of ports of call; future increases in the price of, or major changes, disruptions or reduction in, commercial airline services; changes involving the tax and environmental regulatory regimes in which we operate, including new regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions; the accuracy of any appraisals of our assets as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise; our success in controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures; trends in, or changes to, future bookings and our ability to take future reservations and receive deposits related thereto; adverse events impacting the security of travel, or customer perceptions of the security of travel, such as terrorist acts, armed conflict, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and threats thereof, acts of piracy, and other international events; adverse incidents involving cruise ships; breaches in data security or other disturbances to our information technology and other networks or our actual or perceived failure to comply with requirements regarding data privacy and protection; changes in fuel prices and the type of fuel we are permitted to use and/or other cruise operating costs; mechanical malfunctions and repairs, delays in our shipbuilding program, maintenance and refurbishments and the consolidation of qualified shipyard facilities; the risks and increased costs associated with operating internationally; our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or the loss of key personnel or employee relations issues; impacts related to climate change and our ability to achieve our climate-related or other sustainability goals; our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage; pending or threatened litigation, investigations and enforcement actions; volatility and disruptions in the global credit and financial markets, which may adversely affect our ability to borrow and could increase our counterparty credit risks, including those under our credit facilities, derivatives, contingent obligations, insurance contracts and new ship progress payment guarantees; any further impairment of our trademarks, trade names or goodwill; our reliance on third parties to provide hotel management services for certain ships and certain other services; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; our expansion into new markets and investments in new markets and land-based destination projects; overcapacity in key markets or globally; and other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The above examples are not exhaustive and new risks emerge from time to time. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates and projections regarding our present and future business strategies and the environment in which we expect to operate in the future. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change of events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement was based, except as required by law.Investor Relations &amp; Media Contact Jessica John (305)

At the mid-point of the guidance, net sales are expected to grow 16.5% year over year.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between $1.63 per share and $1.65 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.64 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating growth of 19.71% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.29 billion, suggesting an improvement of 16.55% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMicrochip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseMicrochip Technology Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteMicrochip’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 1.38% on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the company prior to this announcement:Factors to ConsiderMicrochip is riding on consistent strength in its analog and mixed-signal microcontroller businesses. It is expected to have gained from the dominance of its 8, 16 and 32-bit microcontrollers in the fiscal first quarter.Mixed-signal microcontrollers represented 58% of the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues.Our model estimates fiscal first-quarter mixed-signal microcontrollers revenues of $1.29 billion, indicating 21.2% year-over-year growth.Microchip’s fiscal first-quarter results are expected to benefit from strong industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, and data center end markets. Nevertheless, weakness in the consumer end market is expected to have hurt its top-line growth.Moreover, raging inflation and higher interest rates are expected to have hurt profitability.What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

42,7766d0c0-0397-362d-8747-15abaaa232de,MET,2023-08-01,Will Reduced Premiums Hurt MetLife's (MET) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reduced-premiums-hurt-metlifes-met-163000024.html,1690821000,STORY,"['MET', 'AEL', 'AFL', 'ARES']","[MetLife, Inc. MET is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 has declined by 5 cents in the past week. The estimated figure suggests a decrease of 7.5% from the prior-year reported number. Also, the consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $17.1 billion indicates a 6.4% fall from the year-ago reported figure.MetLife’s earnings beat the consensus estimate in two of the prior four quarters and missed twice, with the average surprise being 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MET’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading insurance-based global financial services company reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.52, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% due to reduced returns, lower investment income despite a high interest rate environment and rising expenses. The negatives were partially offset by volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S., EMEA and Latin America businesses.Now let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to Note   Reduced premiums, higher costs and weaker performance in the Retirement &amp; Income Solutions business are likely to have affected MetLife’s second-quarter results. Our estimate for premiums for the quarter under review suggests a fall of more than 6% from the prior-year quarter.Also, our model indicates that Universal Life and Investment-Type Product Policy Fees for the second quarter will see a 7.3% year-over-year decrease. Rising costs and expenses are likely to have affected the company’s profit levels in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for total expenses for the second quarter indicates a more than 5% year-over-year increase.Story continuesThe company is expected to have witnessed lower profits from Retirement &amp; Income Solutions and MetLife Holdings businesses in the second quarter. While we expect adjusted pre-tax income from the Retirement &amp; Income Solutions business to have declined almost 14% year over year, the same from MetLife Holdings is likely to have dropped more than 28%.Further, our estimate for adjusted pre-tax income in Asia indicates a nearly 38% plunge from the prior-year period. The above-mentioned factors are likely to have led to a year-over-year decline in profits, making an earnings beat uncertain.However, our estimate for net investment income indicates a 21.7% year-over-year increase from the year-ago period. We expect MET’s U.S. Group Benefits’ adjusted revenues to increase 1.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reading.Our estimate for adjusted revenues in Latin America indicates a jump of 11.4% from the year-ago period’s actuals. These are expected to have partially offset the negatives in the quarter under review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MetLife this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.85 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MetLife currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for MetLife, here are some companies in the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Equity Investment’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.65 per share, which indicates a 68.4% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for AEL’s revenues is pegged at $555 million.Ares Management Corporation ARES has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ares Management’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 84 cents per share, suggesting a 13.5% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $725.8 million. ARES beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 2%.Aflac Incorporated AFL has an Earnings ESP of +1.41% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.42 per share, which remained stable over the past week.

Forward-looking statements included herein speak only as of the date hereof and Gartner disclaims any obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESCertain financial measures used in this Press Release are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") and as such are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release are defined below.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for: (i) interest expense, net; (ii) tax provision (benefit); (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) other (income) expense, net; (vi) stock-based compensation expense; (vii) depreciation, amortization, and accretion; (viii) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; and (ix) acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP Revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of our recurring operations as they exclude items not representative of our core operating results.Adjusted Net Income: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Adjusted EPS: Represents GAAP diluted EPS adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include on a per share basis: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Free Cash Flow: Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP less payments for capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Foreign Currency Neutral (FX Neutral): We provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our contract values, revenues, certain expenses, and other metrics. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured.

(AP) — Two pipeline operators have agreed to pay a $12.5 million civil penalty related to crude oil spills in Montana and North Dakota.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday announced the settlement in a 2022 federal court lawsuit. Belle Fourche Pipeline Company and Bridger Pipeline LLC will pay the $12.5 million to resolve the claims made under the Clean Water Act and Pipeline Safety Laws, the EPA said. The affiliated companies own and operate oil pipelines in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming.In 2015, Bridger's Poplar Pipeline broke and spilled more than 50,000 gallons (about 190,000 liters) of crude into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana. Bridger has completed cleanup of the site, and in 2021 settled a lawsuit with federal and Montana authorities for $2 million. Montana's Department of Environmental Quality previously fined Bridger $1 million in the case.In 2016, Belle Fourche's Bicentennial Pipeline in Billings County, North Dakota, broke due to a landslide and spilled over 600,000 gallons (about 2.3 million liters) of oil, impacting an unnamed tributary, Ash Coulee Creek and the Little Missouri River. Belle Fourche's cleanup is ongoing with oversight from North Dakota's Department of Environmental Quality, according to the EPA.The agreement announced Monday does not resolve all issues with the Ash Coulee spill and reserves the government’s right to bring future legal claims.The $12.5 million civil penalty includes a nearly $4.6 million portion for North Dakota's Department of Environmental Quality. Belle Fourche also will pay the state's past response costs, totaling over $98,000, according to court documents filed Monday.“Oil pipeline spills can cause enormous and long-lasting damage to the environment,” Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Larry Starfield of the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance said in a statement. “This settlement holds Belle Fourche and Bridger Pipeline accountable for their significant oil spills and requires them to take meaningful measures to prevent future spills from their oil pipelines.”Story continuesThe operators also are required to implement specified compliance measures, in addition to the civil penalty.Belle Fourche and Bridger are owned by Wyoming-based True Companies.Bridger spokesman Bill Salvin said the operators have completed all remediation actions “to date” required by North Dakota's Department of Environmental Quality and “will work closely” with the department if further action is required. Future soil testing remains, Salvin said.He said the operators have made upgrades to their pipeline network to enhance safety, including a new control center at their Casper, Wyoming, headquarters and a new leak detection system powered by artificial intelligence.]"

To skip our analysis of the recent market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Most Oversold S&amp;P 500 Stocks Right Now.The stock markets have been through the wringer in the recent past especially since March 2022 as the United States Federal Reserve began its tightening process. Despite that, major stock indices in the United States have already recuperated some of their losses in the recent past. The S&amp;P 500 Index is up 3.07% in July and nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ-100 indices are up 7.1% and 45.1% year-to-date, respectively.Several factors, including major breakthroughs in the Artificial Intelligence arena, a pause in interest rate hikes, better than expected inflation results, and resilient economic growth. The latest economic data shows that the United States economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in Q2 2023, nearly a full percentage point more than consensus estimates.After a streak of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the period of 14 months by the United States Federal Reserve, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in its June meeting. On July 26, the Fed announced a further 25 bps interest rate hike which brings the funds rate to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. This marks the benchmark rate at its highest level since 2001.The comments of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference generated mixed results for the equities markets. Even though policymakers indicated the possibility of two rate hikes by the end of the year, in their June meeting, Powell’s comments have raised hopes for just the one interest rate hike this year. The Fed Chairman affirmed that the central bank intends to make data-driven decisions concerning any further rate hikes on a “meeting-by-meeting” basis.Jerome Powell said in his press conference on July 26:Story continues“I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.”The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990. Companies involved in the AI landscape are playing an important role in uplifting the index.

57,03cc476a-13fb-3e7c-8de6-ae7ed1887a9d,FE,2023-08-01,The FirstEnergy scandal shows everything that could go wrong with companies’ political spending in 2024,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-scandal-shows-everything-could-165939117.html,1690822779,STORY,['FE'],"[When the Cleveland Browns removed the scandal-tarnished name of FirstEnergy from their football stadium, it symbolized how far the Ohio utility’s good reputation had fallen. The name change followed guilty verdicts returned for Ohio’s former House speaker and former GOP state chair in a bribery-and-racketeering scheme fueled with almost $61 million from FirstEnergy. The company has admitted that it bribed state officials and relied on untraceable dark money to do it, in seeking a bailout for two failing nuclear plants.FirstEnergy is the poster child of the risks and harms a company faces from failing to oversee and monitor its political spending. But corruption charges are infrequent; in today’s hyperpolarized climate, more companies run into problems when their political spending winds up in perceived conflict with their public stances. Just ask the blue-chip companies recently facing controversy over money funneled to legislators who upheld an abortion ban in North Carolina.Corporations increasingly face risk from their political spending, and that risk is heightened when they have not charted where funds will actually go. When political spending is funneled through “dark money” groups used by candidates and officeholders or through third-party groups such as trade organizations or non-profit partisan groups, corporations (and their shareholders) often don’t know how their money will actually be spent. When discovered and spotlighted, such contributions can ultimately associate a company with controversial political figures, positions contrary to core company values and interests, or corruption.There are proactive steps companies can and should take to mitigate the risk. But first, let’s take a closer look at the reality of these risks in a new era of rising and stealthy corporate political spending that is encountering stepped-up public scrutiny.At the nucleus of the FirstEnergy scandal was Generation Now, a dark money outfit commonly called a “social welfare” organization and established under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. These groups can accept unlimited, undisclosed contributions. Indeed, it is a sign of their popularity that nearly every candidate aspiring to the presidency in 2024 is associated with such an organization.Story continuesGeneration Now pled guilty to racketeering charges, and FirstEnergy has suffered enormous costs as well as withering reputational harm from this public corruption scandal. The Department of Justice assessed a fine of $230 million. Investors have brought a class-action lawsuit. Two former top FirstEnergy executives, who were fired, say they are federal investigation targets. Meanwhile, former Ohio Speaker Larry Householder, convicted of participating in a racketeering conspiracy, was sentenced in June to 20 years in prison.The controversy over political spending in North Carolina emerged after Republican legislators overturned a veto by the Democratic governor of a 12-week abortion ban. Nine of the anti-abortion legislators had campaign support from a group linked to the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), a partisan nonprofit. The RSLC received donations of tens of thousands of dollars last year from corporations including Comcast, Intuit, Wells Fargo, Amazon, Google, and Bank of America.These companies became ripe targets for scrutiny because they also had made statements supporting access to abortion care. It’s increasingly common for public companies like these to come under fire. Through their treasury donations and those of their trade associations, they are dominant funders of large state-focused groups called 527s (for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that governs them). The Democratic and Republican governors’ associations are perhaps the best-known 527 groups.Each political dollar a company donates poses a risk it must manage. Companies should carefully evaluate in advance where the political money trail might lead and whether it might expose them to financial, reputational, or even legal risks and employee disaffection. In the language of business, this is simply called exercising due diligence.If companies give to third-party groups, good governance dictates that they should map the money trail to see where it ends up. Thus, it’s no surprise that shareholders are asking leading companies in proxy resolutions to require reports from such third-party groups, detailing the political expenditures they make and the ultimate recipients. Companies would then post the information online. There are skeptics of this kind of due diligence and transparency, however, including two leading proxy advisory firms, that appear to contend companies are effectively powerless to require this accounting from third-party groups. This view skirts the reality that through their dues or contributions, for example, companies wield leverage over trade associations, 527s, and dark money groups. But even if this information were truly unavailable to the companies writing the checks, both management and shareholders would want to know that as well.The position of these proxy advisory firms is also inconsistent with sound third-party risk management practices in other areas. For example, companies are encouraged to and do apply standards to monitor and regulate corporate contributions to charitable and philanthropic organizations. Applying similarly robust standards to their political spending enables corporations to pull back the curtain, assert the necessary control over their corporate funds, and in doing so, fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.Yes, “elections have consequences,” as former President Obama has said. So does corporate spending to influence elections–and the consequences aren’t always what companies expect.Companies today face intense scrutiny from the media, the public, shareholders, and employees. They may even face intimidation from Washington and state capitals. To manage risk and thrive in this new era, companies should stop rolling the dice with political donations and follow their own money trail before someone else does it for them.Allison Herren Lee is the former Acting Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission where she advocated for greater transparency for investors around corporate political spending.

While the capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth boosted profits.Factors That Likely Impacted PerformancesDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are concentrating on cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand and assisting the utilities. Investments in strengthening the infrastructure are allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations. The performances of the utilities are likely to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses, and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on their utility bills.Utilities have been adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios. Weather in the second quarter was mild that adversely impacted the use per customer during the period.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

CRM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMMarc Benioff is a well-known figure in the tech industry. He co-founded Salesforce in 1999 and has since served as its Chair and CEO. Under his leadership, Salesforce has grown into a leading provider of enterprise software, specializing in customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) services. The company's innovative cloud-based solutions have revolutionized the way businesses manage their customer relationships and interactions.Over the past year, Benioff has sold a total of 952,425 shares and has not made any purchases. This recent sale of 15,000 shares is just a fraction of his total transactions over the past year.Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO of Salesforce Inc, Sells 15,000 SharesThe insider transaction history for Salesforce Inc shows a clear trend of insider selling. Over the past year, there have been 236 insider sells and no insider buys. This could be a signal to investors about the company's future prospects, although it's important to note that insider selling can occur for a variety of reasons, not all of which are negative.On the day of Benioff's recent sale, shares of Salesforce were trading at $227.76, giving the company a market cap of $219.73 billion. This is a significant increase from the company's initial public offering (IPO) price, reflecting the company's substantial growth over the past two decades.Despite the high price-earnings ratio of 593.68, which is significantly higher than the industry median of 28.32, Salesforce's stock appears to be modestly undervalued based on its GuruFocus Value of $300.87. The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.76 suggests that the stock is trading below its intrinsic value.Story continuesMarc Benioff, Chair and CEO of Salesforce Inc, Sells 15,000 SharesThe GF Value is calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. Despite the recent insider selling, the stock's modest undervaluation could present an attractive opportunity for investors.In conclusion, while Marc Benioff's recent sale of 15,000 shares is part of a larger trend of insider selling at Salesforce, the company's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Investors should consider these factors, along with the company's strong market position and innovative product offerings, when making investment decisions.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PG&amp;E. View our latest analysis for PG&amp;E ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PG&amp;E?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.PG&amp;E already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PG&amp;E's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. PG&amp;E is not owned by hedge funds. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 12% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.4% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 53% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PG&amp;EThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of PG&amp;E Corporation in their own names. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$48m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in PG&amp;E. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PG&amp;E better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with PG&amp;E (at least 2 which are concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

To skip our detailed analysis of the trends and dynamics of women's businesses, head directly to see the 5 Richest Women in the World.Women’s WealthA lot of the richest people in the world have had to lose their wealth in 2022. According to Forbes World’s Richest List 2023, the total number of billionaires dropped from 2,668 in 2022 to 2,640 in 2023. Overall, the world’s billionaires have lost $500 billion of net worth from $12.7 trillion in March 2022 to $12.2 trillion in March 2023. An interesting fact to note is that the number of female billionaires is on the rise. Among the top richest people in the world, there are 337 women billionaires, up from 327 in 2022. Women have started to step up and take the initiative of starting their businesses. As we mentioned earlier, almost half of all women-owned businesses are from three sectors that include healthcare and social assistance, beauty and pet care, and scientific and technical services. Women-owned businesses in the U.S. have performed significantly well. First Round Capital claims that the companies it invested in with female founders outperformed all-male founding companies by 63%. Additionally, as we discussed previously, Kauffman Fellows found women-led teams produced 35% better return on investment compared to all-male teams.Women Kept Under Shadows for YearsWomen have faced gender discrimination for centuries in politics, in the workplace, and at home. In some countries, women are legally restricted to work in certain professions while in other economies, they are discriminated against by pay gaps. These are a few problems that have kept women under the shadow for many years. Developed economies have made major changes in their laws and frameworks to implement gender equality across all phases of life. Feminists have been vocal about the interests of women in all fields of life. According to Pacific University, in 1848 the first wave of modern feminism took place at the Seneca Falls Convention. Elizabeth Cady Stanton introduced and drafted the Seneca Falls Declaration highlighting the ideology and political aspects of the movement. The second movement in the 1960s focused on social equality with equal rights regardless of sex. The movement continued once again in the 1990s, proving the point that women can play an equal and as important role as men. Story continuesTechnology Paving Ways for WomenOne of the major things that have played a big role in women’s equality is technology. Modern technology has created awareness across the globe and women have explored their potential in the best way possible. For instance, women entrepreneurs have made the best use of e-commerce. The e-commerce marketplace has allowed women to capitalize in one of the largest markets in the world. The biggest e-commerce company, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has around 9.7 million sellers worldwide, and 1.9 million are active on the platform. On June 19, SellerApp shared the Amazon.com seller statistics showing that women account for 33% of the retailer's sellers, which is a sublime development for women entrepreneurs.Companies Led by Female CEOsWe have entered a new era as more than 10% of women now lead Fortune 500 companies. The Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S. public companies by revenue. These companies accumulate around $18 trillion in revenue, representing more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. For many decades, the big companies were dominated by male executives. Now we have 53 female CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, which enlightens gender diversity in executive leadership to another level. Women now have a more important role to play as executives, making massive decisions at the top level.Some of the Fortune 500 companies which are led by female CEOs include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV). These five Fortune 500 companies are led by CEOs Lisa Su, Karen Lynch, Mary Barra, Rosalind Brewer, and Gail Koziara Boudreaux, respectively. The female CEOs are putting in a great effort to take these companies to new heights. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the largest companies on the Fortune 500 list. On June 14, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled its next-generation chip called MI-300 at its product reveal event, which is being considered a potential alternative to NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI chips. The company is using AI to be its next big tool for GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions. The CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Lisa Su, during the launch event, highlighted AI as ""AMD's largest and most strategic long term growth opportunity."" Shortly after the event, Lisa Su, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the development of their new AI chip, M1-300. AMD has entered into a new phase of chipmaking with the announcement of its newest generation chip. Su added that everyone is talking about Chatgpt and large language models, and MI-300 is designed for these use cases. Here are some of the comments from Su:""AI is the defining megatrend for the technology right now. Like, everybody is talking about AI, we have been working on this roadmap for many many years. MI-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it’s incredible and I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a 153 billion transistors. Our customers are super excited about this and we are working closely with them. We will sample in the third quarter and will be in production by the end of the year. What we see is there is a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers and many of the largest enterprise guys. So, the key is to get these products to market as fast as possible. It is an incredible time for technology. AI has kinda changed the way we perceive what we’re doing in every industry and every market for all of our productivity and business applications. We have developed a really comprehensive software capability that is optimized for hardware. We call that the ROCm ecosystem, but on top of that we’ve all these folks in the market that are really developing these frameworks, and the purpose of these frameworks is actually to make it fairly easy and transparent to move different hardware ecosystems.""According to Su, the total addressable market for AI GPUs is around $30 billion right now and it is going to grow more than 50% each year over the next three to four years. ""We see like $150 billion by the time we get to 2027,"" added Su.25 Richest Women in the WorldRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo find the list of the 25 richest women in the world, we took the data from Forbes’ Real-time Billionaire List.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food and quick service restaurant sector, you can go directly to the 5 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America.Over the past few decades, fast food has become an important part of life in the United States. Not surprisingly, the fast food and quick service restaurant business is extremely competitive today. People are always looking for food that is inexpensive, appealing, full of taste, and fast.A number of fast food chains and quick service restaurants in America have become institutions over the years. With new competition, sometimes the old players are pushed out. And sometimes the new ones don’t really have what it takes to make it in the fast and competitive fast food industry. In this article, we will be looking at 12 fast food restaurant chains in the US that have the highest number of restaurant locations closures, but first let’s take a look at the fast food and quick service restaurant industry.The Fast Food and Quick Service Restaurant Industry to Reach $320 BillionPreviously, the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 led to some of the biggest restaurant chains to file for bankruptcies in 2020. Food delivery services and online ordering helped some of the biggest fast food companies stay alive during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In one of our previous articles, 25 Most Valuable Food Companies in The World, we also discussed briefly how the food industry is currently facing challenges with regards to food safety concerns. However, we mentioned that the continuously growing global population remains one of the key drivers of growth in the food and restaurant industry.According to Research and Markets, the global fast food and quick service restaurant market was valued at $243.9 billion in the year 2022. The highly competitive market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during 2023-2028, reaching $319.7 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Inclination of consumers, mainly millennials, towards fast food items and ready-to-eat meals is one of the biggest factors that is expected to help the market to flourish in the coming years. The increasing working population and their hectic schedules have significantly heightened the consumption of fast food in a number of countries around the world. The demand for fast food and quick service items is on the rise, and this remains one of the key factors creating a more positive outlook for the market. In addition to this, factors such as digitization and modernization of the restaurant outlets, combined with the utilization of digital sales terminals and touchscreen kiosks, are expected to further augment market growth.Story continuesSome restaurant and food company stocks that are expected to become a popular choice during this period include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).While the global food and restaurant industry was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis, signs of recovery continue to create a positive outlook for the market as some of the biggest names in the industry shift their focus towards growth. On March 6, Reuters reported that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will be looking to open as many as 100 new outlets in the UK. The corporation is reportedly on track to invest GBP 30 million in their UK operations for the launch of new locations as well as renovation of their more than 1000 already existing outlets.With regards to the market in China, here are some comments from Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Moving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge from 3 years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers.We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11%, excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past 3 years, despite COVID disruptions and mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability.”However, global inflation and rising food prices has caused problems for some of the top contenders in the fast food industry. Despite being one of the biggest fast food companies in the world, Subway had to close more than a thousand of their locations in the US in recent years. On May 1, Reuters published an article that claimed that the Subway chain of restaurants declined by 2.7% in the US due to closures in 2022.On the other hand, on July 24, Reuters posted that restaurant chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) are set to report strong earnings in the fiscal second half of this year as the prices of commodities such as chicken and dairy have eased. The post also claims that data from Placer.ai showed that visits to McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) increased by 8.4% in the second quarter, while visits to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) rose by 15.7%.On July 27, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.17, beating the EPS estimates by $0.38. The company reported a revenue of $6.5 billion and surpassed revenue estimates by $202.69 million.12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In AmericaCopyright: bhofack2 / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this list, we ranked the 12 worst performing fast food chains in America based on location closures and the loss of restaurant locations since 2018.

measures, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Other than free cash flow, any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of: (1) restructuring charges, (2) expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and (3) severance charges; acquisition-related costs consisting of: (a) intangible amortization expense and (b) acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions; and the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collectability of our pre-pandemic trade receivable balances. Our results for fiscal 2023 were also impacted by adjustments to a product return allowance pertaining to COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory, a pension settlement charge that resulted from the purchase of a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that transferred defined benefit plan obligations to an insurer, and a litigation financing agreement. Our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by a write-down of COVID-related personal protection equipment inventory due to the reduction in the net realizable value of inventory, losses on the extinguishment of long-term debt and an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions.The results of our operations can be impacted due to changes in exchange rates applicable in converting local currencies to U.S. dollars. We measure our results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency operating results are calculated by translating current-period local currency operating results with the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items and presenting its results on a constant currency basis, provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that (1) is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and (2) facilitates comparisons on a year-over-year basis.Sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions and excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, acquisition costs and due-diligence costs for those acquisitions. We believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of Sysco’s results for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.Set forth below is a reconciliation of sales, operating expenses, operating income, other (income) expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented. Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add up to the total presented due to rounding. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding.Sysco Corporation and its Consolidated SubsidiariesNon-GAAP Reconciliation

Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:16% = US$4.2b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. This certainly adds some context to Archer-Daniels-Midland's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Archer-Daniels-Midland's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 8.3% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Archer-Daniels-Midland is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Archer-Daniels-Midland has a three-year median payout ratio of 31% (where it is retaining 69% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Archer-Daniels-Midland has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 34%. Still, forecasts suggest that Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE will drop to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

A new report from Bloomberg shows that purchases made directly through the major U.S. airlines fell in the second quarter. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the report and explains why consumers may be starting to pull back.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: We're going to take a look at some of the trending stories of the day. Josh Schafer is here to help us break it all down. And guys, first up, let's talk about the travel boom or maybe lack thereof pretty soon, because it might be signs that it could be fading here. There's new data compiled by Bloomberg and taking a look at flights booked directly through airlines. And they found an interesting trend. And that's the fact that that number declined in the second quarter for eight of the 10 domestic, largest domestic airlines here.So you got to ask yourself whether or not inflation is starting to catch up with consumers, when it comes-- obviously has a lot of ways-- when it comes to spending on travel, an area that we haven't necessarily seen any weakness in yet, at least for the airlines.JOSH SCHAFER: And the other interesting thing I saw in that article, Diane, was that they were pointing out that Alaska Airlines actually said that prices came down, right? So when you think about even just-- even if demand does come down right and people have less money to spend, also if these airlines are charging less money for the flights, you would need more people to go on the flights. So I think that's kind of an interesting dynamic at play, too, when you think about pricing power and just flight prices being a little bit cheaper.Does that mean that all of a sudden we're going to start taking two flights again? I don't know. We're so used to these flights being expensive, right?DIANE KING HALL: I mean, but it also, you wonder if it's a tale of two airlines. I mean, you had Delta Airlines doing great. I mean, they hiked their forecast. Delta and United both doing well, though. United had some snafus recently. And it's certainly not helpful to the airlines when you have all the travel problems and the mess at the airport. I experienced that this weekend myself due to weather, of course, so they can kind of blame it away. And that certainly doesn't kind of help the travel picture.Story continuesI do-- I did feel like just-- I mean, this is anecdotally that demand was still holding up right now. But again, we're talking about summer bookings, which are basically done.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And it's very important to point out that this data actually tracks when they are booked rather than-- so right now, rather than the airlines who actually obviously don't really take it into account until the actual flight until you go on the flight, until that revenue is actually produced. But prices, they're still above where we were in 2019. So they're down on a year-over-year basis. But 2022, the flights-- the prices that we were looking at a year ago was astronomical and not much improvement.But I think right now, when people are feeling so pressured in almost every aspect of their life, if you've already gone on a few trips since COVID, maybe that pent-up demand story that we've been talking about for so long, that's going to fade. And I think this is the question and this was-- we were struggling really to try to put the timeline on this of when we would actually see some impact when it comes to the travel names. And at least when you look at this index, and it doesn't include booking sites, it doesn't include corporate sales, we are starting to see some of that weakness.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, and we haven't even talked about business travel, right, when we're talking about flights overall and airlines overall.DIANE KING HALL: --leisure travel.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. And that's something that Southwest flagged last week, right? Bob Jordan saying that basically, they're not seeing business travel come back all the way to the extent that they thought they were going to. And they're not sure when it's going to come back. So then you think about that with maybe the general consumer demand that was maybe even a little bit higher than normal coming down. And you have a tough-- that's a tough balance.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. The business travel will come back. But will it be enough to compensate for the reduction in consumer? Because revenge spending won't last forever.SEANA SMITH: I question if business travel is really going to come back across the board.DIANE KING HALL: You don't think so? I think it will.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. You would have thought, at this point, maybe it would have. But some airlines are saying that they're very confident that we are going to get there if they haven't reached there yet. I'm still a bit skeptical. But we'll see.]"

96,5e636a76-9a02-31fc-a5a0-29fa1d05c73d,LUV,2023-08-01,More Americans are traveling internationally: Which airlines stand to benefit,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/more-americans-traveling-internationally-airlines-152856270.html,1690817336,VIDEO,"['JBLU', 'LUV', 'UAL', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[Based on airlines' earnings, it's clear that Americans still want to travel. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker tells Yahoo Finance Live that demand has begun to shift from domestic to international travel. Becker ""American (Airlines), Delta, and United have done really well this year"" because they have the most exposure to international travel.Video Transcript- Let's get to airlines in particular and the numbers that they've been reporting and have yet to report. It's been a mixed picture for the industry this year despite raised forecasts from the likes of Delta and American Airlines and soaring earnings as travel demand remains strong. There are still cost concerns and looming pilot shortages still lingering.For more on the state of the industry, we're joined by Helane Becker, TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst. Helane, it's always good to see you. We've heard from most of them. We still have JetBlue to report tomorrow. But kind of give us a state of play of where we are given what we've heard so far.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. I think-- thanks for the question. I think what we're seeing in terms of demand is still very, very strong demand but pricing has come off their peaks. And I guess it was just not sustainable that ticket prices would stay as robust as they were, number one. And number two, I think you're seeing a shift as well. We've talked about demand being strong domestically for 2021 and 2022 and then shifting internationally for '23 and '24.And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing very strong North Atlantic demand and Europe. And I'm going to say air quotes around everybody seems to be in Italy this summer. And then next summer we think we'll see strong demand on the Trans-pacific for all markets except for probably China.- And so Helane, with that kind of international travel focus that you were just alluding to a moment ago, who are the biggest beneficiaries from your coverage and perspective?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, exactly. That's why American, Delta, and United have done really well this year because they have the most exposure. And United specifically is more exposed to international markets than any of the other airlines. JetBlue has a couple of flights, one to Paris one to London. And I think they're adding Amsterdam next month. And that's it. Some of the other smaller US airlines, like Frontier and Spirit fly near US markets. So they'll do Caribbean, Mexico, Northern South America.Story continuesBut that's that demand was part of last year's strength. This year's strength is really on the North Atlantic and most airlines, with the exception actually of United, got rid of all their widebody or a lot of their widebody aircraft during the pandemic. And now with the demand shifting, they're having a hard time keeping up because they don't have the aircraft to put into service. And that's why you've seen American and Delta come out with some aircraft orders. And B, the other thing that we've seen in terms of demand for aircraft a shift to least in aircraft or buying aircraft off from the Lessor's primarily because the OEMs are still lagging on deliveries.- Even with the strong demand environment, it seems like some of the travel headaches are still looming large. You ask passengers just-- and I mean, you're nodding in concert with perhaps a lot of the emotions and feelings of some of our viewers right now. How does that kind of add on a knock on effect to some of the airlines right now that are either bringing capacity, continuing to bring that back online, or have code sharing agreements where they're sending passengers through some of the rigmarole of just how if they miss their flights where they need to rebook, who gets the credit, so forth. What type of knock on the stock does that eventually create, if any?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, no, that's a really great question. So I mean, it's just so frustrating for passengers. You plan all year long for your vacation, you're looking forward to it, and then something goes wrong the day that you travel. And it's not always the fault of the airlines. Sometimes it's weather that creeps in, especially summer storms. Those are so unpredictable versus, we've talked about this before, Brad you and I, the winter storms are almost always predictable. You know when you're going to get a big snowstorm. But with summer pop up thunderstorms, you don't.And then there are downstream delays, to your point. And then passengers get frustrated. And I think the eventual effect will be, well, we sort of did that. I'm tired of all my flights being delayed or many flights being delayed. I'm just not going to take a trip that month or that week. I'm going to try to find a day of the week, like Tuesday, Wednesday, that might be less busy. And that does definitely impact results at some point. It's just right now everybody, again, those air quotes, wants to travel.And until schools start to resume and in some cases, especially Southern tier of the US, they'll start to resume next week and the week after, you'll still see strong travel out of the Northeast. And we don't-- that's not going to stop because those bookings are already made. But we've seen airports start to hire more people in an effort to help during the busiest times. And yeah, it just gets really frustrating. I get it.And I always say to people, welcome to my life. I feel like for every [AUDIO OUT] that's on time or early, I'm going to pay for it with a later canceled flight at some point in my future.- Well, it's funny, Helane, because as the airlines try to manage through it-- just as an example, my son was flying this weekend. We got a message from the airline the night before, you might want to think about pushing your trip because there are thunderstorms forecast for the next day. Guess what, no thunderstorms. Totally clear. The flight left on time. So I'd be pretty upset if I changed my flight with the anticipation that the--So it really does seem like a no win situation but it also seems like a situation that technology and more staffing could at least help. So that implies that the airlines are going to have to spend more to address this, especially if the demand remains even close to the fever pitch where it's been.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. And the demand that we're seeing also is pretty equal to what we saw in 2019 but the mix is different. It's more leisure and it's less business. And I think one difference is that people who are infrequent travelers get more stressed out than people who are frequent travelers and know that this type of thing happens is, quote unquote, ""all the time.""But the other thing, to your point, one of the things that technology could do for the airlines is an enable connecting passengers to change the connecting hub. So if you're coming from mid-con and let's say you're coming out of Saint Louis and you're going to London and your first choice was to connect over New York, if New York is going to have thunderstorms, maybe Boston doesn't or Chicago doesn't. Maybe those storms have passed through.From the airline's perspective, they should be able to reroute you over a different hub and their technology should enable either you to do that on their website or your iPhone or your smart device, or they can do it for you so that you don't miss a day of your vacation because, to your point, just because there are forecast thunderstorms in my town, there may not be in yours. So we can-- they should be able to, with technology, make those adjustments.And that's something that I find interesting because the industry was an early adopter of technology and using computers to issue boarding passes and check bags, and so on. And then through the bankruptcies that they all experienced in the last or two decades ago and they lagged on updating their technology. And I think they're starting to think about catching up now.- Helane, just while we have you, we asked the CFO of Chipotle last week-- and follow me on this one. We asked the CFO of Chipotle last week how global warming could impact how they think about their business. And that was with regard to kind of sourcing the necessary menu items.For airlines and the travel experience, I mean, you just talked about storms and more severe weather that they have to account for and communicate that to their passengers. And their passengers may eventually shift some of the travel schedules around unknown parts of the year where there could be extreme weather that derails their trip plans. Is there a broader kind of concern or at least a thought or evaluation that these companies are starting to give around global warming and how that changes what the customer propensity is to travel at certain times of the year?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. That's a really great question because it's something that we've been looking at for the last year or so. And it's slightly different-- well, in two different ways. One, exactly what you're saying. Markets like Seattle for an example that historically wouldn't have snow, it would have rain, but it wouldn't be so overwhelming rain that it would shut the airport down for an extended period of time. And yet last winter, you saw Seattle experience snow and ice.So you're definitely seeing that weather pattern shift that's causing airports that haven't had to deal with de-icing or runway clearing to have to start thinking about their investments in de-icing pads, de-icing fluid, and so on. So that's definitely one thing that we are paying attention to and I think the airlines and the airports are starting to think about. We're seeing that at various conferences that's being added as a discussion item. So yes to that part.And then the other part that I would say is with respect to sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has some commitment with a producer of SAF to provide that to them over the next, say, decade because a lot of those orders go out that far. And the government through the Inflation Reduction Act is incentivizing manufacturers, the energy manufacturers, to produce more SAF.And that's really the problem. Airlines are only 2% of emissions but the longest flights are 80% of the total emissions. So it's not really a-- like road transport is still the number one emissions. But that said, airlines are an easy target and we need more sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has said, we're there to buy it if you make it. And you just have to do it in a cost effective manner.The industry worldwide, Brad, to give you an idea of the numbers, uses 100 billion gallons of jet fuel annually. And the amount of sustainable aviation fuel that's out there right now is less than 5%. I don't even think it's 1%. So it's not even-- like it's in the ballpark of what's needed. And that's a 20-- I say that's a 2025 to 2040 development. That's where you're going to see the industry go over the next 15 years.- Helane, always a fascinating conversation. Thanks so much for taking the time to really break down what you're tracking over at TD Cowen. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker joining us this morning. Thanks so much.]"

Generally, it’s better to accumulate the top growth stocks to buy for long-term growth rather than companies that merely have short-term momentum. Of course, valuation also matters. At the wrong price, a company can still disappoint even if its growth rates remain stellar.There are plenty of top growth stocks to buy now. In fact, here are seven that are worth buying on dips. Plus, all will continue to thrive for many years regardless of what happens with interest rates, the economy, or the tech sector in the immediate future.Top Growth Stocks to Buy: Mastercard (MA)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockMastercard (NYSE:MA) is one of the two dominant global credit card companies. These firms are an effective oligopoly, with the top two players having a stunning 87% share of the overall credit card processing market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAfter all, Mastercard takes no credit risk. The banks that issue the cards are responsible for that. Rather, Mastercard gets paid a small fee on every transaction that goes through its network. With billions of dollars in daily transactions, that money adds up.A few years ago, there were worries that FinTech or cryptocurrency offerings could displace credit card companies. However, disruption proved difficult, with many of the purported rivals running large losses or even shutting down entirely. The truth is that Mastercard has a massive scale advantage and network effect due to its global scope and unmatched level of both consumer and merchant adoption.Mastercard has grown revenues at 12 %/year compounded over the past decade and earnings per share at 16%. The pandemic temporarily impacted the business. But with the global travel resurgence, Mastercard is back to delivering record profits and growth should continue nicely from here.Story continuesTop Growth Stocks to Buy: Danaher (DHR)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockDanaher (NYSE:DHR) is a conglomerate focused on the healthcare industry. Traditionally, Danaher has been involved in a great number of industries, with management being a constant M&amp;A machine. This has had jaw-dropping results for shareholders. DHR stock has soared from a split-adjusted price of 9 cents per share in 1983 to more than $250 today.The company has now prepared for the next stage of its incredible growth story. That’s because Danaher has divested or spun off nearly all its non-core businesses, leaving it to entirely focus on life sciences, specifically lab tools, and equipment. Danaher is now fully leveraged to profit from the rise of bioprocessing, that is to say, the advanced techniques needed to create the new waves of biotech drugs such as personalized medicine, RNA therapies, gene editing, and so on.Analysts expect the overall bioprocessing market to grow more than 14% annually over the next decade. Danaher has, once again, shrewdly positioned itself to capture the lion’s share of this upcoming growth. DHR stock is still on sale today as investors panicked and dumped the stock when COVID-19-related revenues dried up. But the long-term story is as strong as ever and analysts expect the firm to return to growth next year.Top Growth Stocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s dominant semiconductor foundry. For companies that don’t own their own fabs, they outsource their chip manufacturing to TSM or its rivals. Taiwan Semiconductor just disclosed a weak earnings outlook as the lingering slowdown in consumer electronics affects results. But the investment cycle into AI chips should overcome that near-term weakness over the next few quarters.And, in the bigger picture, there’s no substitute for Taiwan Semi. As chips find their way into connected cars, home appliances, and many other new fields, overall demand will surge. TSM, with its massive market share, will capture a huge chunk of that expanded market opportunity.Roper (ROP)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comRoper Technologies (NASDAQ:ROP) is a software conglomerate. It operates software businesses spanning a vast number of verticals ranging from K-12 school management to power plants, insurance underwriting, graphic design, and many other things.The company started as Roper Industries and was a manufacturing conglomerate. Over the years, it has transitioned from making things to making software that supports industrial and consumer applications. The latest stage in Roper’s evolution came earlier this month, as the company moved its stock listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq. This makes Roper eligible to be added to the Nasdaq 100 and attract a new wave of passive investing capital into the company.Roper shares have risen subsantially since 1992. As the company continues to build and acquire more software operations while attracting a new wave of tech investor interest, shares should continue their inexorable climb.Starbucks (SBUX)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) had its share of setbacks amid the pandemic. Consumers have changed their behavior over the past few years, and some folks stopped using Starbucks locations as a place to sit and hang out. The firm’s heavy investments in China have also been slowed by that country’s lingering COVID-19 restrictions.On the other hand, Starbucks’ commitment to drive-through lanes paid off in spades, as has the smart positioning of its mobile app and loyalty program. Furthermore, concerns about the brand’s coolness may be overblown.To that point, a recent survey found Starbucks to be the second most popular restaurant among teenagers, trailing only Chick-Fil-A. People love coffee and sugar, and Starbucks is well-positioned to deliver those goods to folks in nearly all parts of the world. SBUX stock is a solid play on the rise of the global consumer class, especially as markets like China and Latin America continue to grow.Texas Instruments (TXN)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company. Analog chips are an attractive field, as they have a slower development cycle than chips that go into fast-moving consumer electronics fields. Lately, analog has been enjoying a major growth wave due to applications in promising fields such as automotive electronics, automation, and remote monitoring/security. As the dominant player in its area, Texas Instruments is grabbing a big piece of these new market opportunities.Texas Instruments has made for a tremendous buy-and-hold investment because of management’s alignment with shareholders. Management is hyper-focused on generating more free cash flow per share and then distributing that to shareholders. In fact, the company has an owners’ manual which starts off by stating the company’s commitment to growing free cash flow and then using it to pay increasing dividends while repurchasing stock.Since 2004, the company has grown free cash flow by 11% per year annualized. It has grown its dividend at a stunning 25%/year annualized since 2004. And it has retired an incredible 47% of its total outstanding stock over that timespan. Texas Instruments is a long-term wealth-generating machine, and investors should relish any opportunities to buy shares on the dip.Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (PAC)growth stocks. Growth Stocks to SellSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.comGrupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (NYSE:PAC) is a Mexican airport operator. It operates 12 airports primarily in the Pacific region of Mexico along with two Jamaican airports. Key holdings include the airports for Guadalajara, Tijuana, and the tourist destinations of Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, respectively.The company IPOed in the United States in 2006 and has delivered a stunning 1,300% return, including dividends, since that point. Its success comes due to the attractive features of airports. Once built, they have low operating costs to maintain. Revenues grow naturally as passenger fees are linked to inflation. And, as traffic grows, revenues from non-aeronautical fields such as concessions, retail, car rentals, hotels, advertising, etc. grow naturally.Mexico is a particular hotbed for airline traffic growth; it has been one of the world’s hottest tourist destinations in recent years due to more relaxed COVID-19 restrictions. Meanwhile, the surge in manufacturing in Mexico, tied to the reshoring movement, is creating lots of new jobs and prosperity in the cities that Pacifico serves. PAC stock has been a massive winner historically, and the tailwinds remain strong for the company heading into the next decade.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN, PAC, ROP, and DHR stock.

While the company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.This Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a first-quarter 2023 FFO per share of $2.74, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80. While results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues on healthy leasing activity, higher operating expenses acted as a dampener.Over the preceding four quarters, Simon Property’s FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed on the other, the average beat being 0.32%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteIn this article, we will dive deep into the U.S. retail real estate market environment and the company's fundamentals and analyze the factors that may have contributed to its second-quarter 2023 performance.US Retail Real Estate Market in Q2Per a report from CBRE Group CBRE, in the U.S. retail real estate market, rent growth has recommenced in the second quarter of 2023 despite the lower demand for space.During the quarter, the net absorption of U.S. retail space amounted to 5.9 million square feet, representing the lowest level of demand since the sector experienced a negative net absorption of 10.1 million square feet in the third quarter of 2020. However, due to elevated construction costs and economic concerns, construction completions remained at historically low levels.Amid these, the overall availability rate declined by 10 basis points (bps) in the second quarter to a record low of 4.8%. Additionally, the average asking rent experienced a year-over-year increase of 2.1%, reaching $23.21 per square foot. This growth was primarily driven by significant gains in Raleigh and various Florida markets, per the CBRE Group report.Story continuesFactors at PlaySimon Property's portfolio of premium assets, both in the United States and internationally, is expected to have benefited from the favorable retail real estate environment. Amid growing consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime, the demand for SPG’s properties is likely to have remained healthy, aiding occupancy levels and leasing activity in the quarter. We estimate total portfolio ending occupancy of 94.5% in the second quarter, reflecting a 10 bps improvement sequentially.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. Moreover, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, are anticipated to have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.24 billion, up from $1.19 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues stands at $28.8 million, marginally below the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $28.81. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.33 billion, indicating an increase of 3.64% year over year.We expect the company’s robust balance sheet position to have supported its strategic expansions during the quarter to be reported.However, the economic slowdown amid macroeconomic uncertainty and higher e-commerce adoption might have cast a pall on SPG’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, rising interest rates might have raised expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. We estimate a 7.5% year-over-year increase in interest expenses in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has remained unrevised at $2.91 over the past month. The figure indicates a decrease of 1.69% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Simon Property this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.42 %.

The graph below depicts this surprise history:INVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC Price and EPS Surprise INVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC Price and EPS SurpriseINVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC price-eps-surprise | INVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter results.Factors at PlayThe mREIT sector was under pressure in the second quarter due to high volatility in the fixed-income markets and the widening of the spread between the 30-year Agency MBS and 10-year treasury rate. This is expected to have affected the book values of the industry players.As of the first-quarter end, 98% of the company’s $5.4-billion portfolio was invested in Agency RMBS. Given the rise in interest rate volatility, higher-coupon Agency RMBS are likely to have underperformed, affecting book value per share for IVR in second-quarter 2023.The Federal Reserve increased policy rates by another 25 basis points in the second quarter, with the rates reaching a 15-year high of 5-5.25%. This is likely to have increased funding costs for the company in the second quarter.We expect the company to have witnessed faster funding cost repricing than asset yields. This is anticipated to have affected margins and increased interest expenses.In the to-be-reported quarter, mortgage rates continued to rise, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.71% in June, up from the 6.32% reported in the prior quarter. Thus, mortgage originations and refinancing continued to decline in the quarter.Story continuesLower levels of refinancing are anticipated to have reduced prepayment speed and alleviated pressure from IVR’s MBS holdings. Moreover, in the first quarter, the company made efforts to invest in specified pools that offer more predictable prepayments. These are expected to have reduced net premium amortization in the second quarter, offering the scope for growth in interest income and average asset yield.Lastly, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for becoming overly optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been unrevised at $1.07 over the past month. It suggests a decline of 23.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Earnings WhispersInvesco Mortgage does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Invesco Mortgage is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Invesco Mortgage currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

I’ll exclude energy stocks from my 503 possible choices to make things interesting. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe average S&amp;P 500 yield as of July 21 was 1.5%. There are approximately 261, yielding more than that. I’ll select one from three different sectors. To add to the intrigue, the stocks selected must be up at least 10% on the year, providing a more difficult task than just picking three stocks with a higher yield. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Source:  Andre Robillard Via UnsplashLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) represents the basic materials sector with a current yield of 5.5%, 3.7x the average S&amp;P 500 yield. Over the past five years, it’s delivered very little to its shareholders, generating an annualized total return of 2.0%.  I’m betting the company, one of the world’s largest producers of polypropylene and other chemicals, is ready for a bit of reversion to the mean. It can’t possibly continue this streak of poor performance in the markets. Especially since its largest shareholder is Access Industries, the private holding company of Ukrainian/American billionaire Len Blavatnik; he doesn’t seem to make too many mistakes. That’s why I recently said Access is one of three dream initial public offerings I’d love to see. Of course, when you are the 35th wealthiest person in the world, you can afford to be patient. It also doesn’t hurt that Access’s 66.7 million shares generate $333 million in annual dividends (based on a $5.00 annualized dividend). Story continuesIn the trailing 12 months, it generated $3.30 billion [cash flow] in free cash flow on $47.5 billion in revenue [income statement]. That’s good for a free cash flow margin of 6.9% and a free cash flow yield of 11.2% (based on market cap) or 8.1% (based on enterprise value).   Either way, LYB stock is cheaper than it’s been in the past decade, making it an excellent value play for patient investors.  Simon Property Group (SPG)Strip mall in FLSimon Property Group’s (NYSE:SPG) current yield is 5.9% based on an annualized rate of $7.40. America’s largest mall operator remains in a funk — its shares, while up nearly 20% in the past 52 weeks, are down 26% over the past five years — despite the fact much of retail is doing just fine in 2023.Furthermore, the demise of the mall has provided the real estate investment trust an opportunity to redevelop some of its malls into alternative uses for its massive real estate footprint. For example, the REIT announced on May 31 that it broke ground on a Residence Inn by Marriott at its Northgate Station mall in Seattle.“We’re excited to work with Marriott to bring the Residence Inn brand as the next phase of the transformational development. Once complete in 2025, the new hotel will be an amenity to the community, Kraken Community Iceplex, and Northgate Station,” said Patrick Peterman, Senior Vice President of Development &amp; Mixed Use, Simon.As cities look for more housing, malls will experience considerable residential real estate growth as their parking lots get redeveloped into rental and condominium housing. With some of the best locations in the country, Simon is at the beginning of a renaissance of sorts. This makes it one of those high yield S&amp;P 500 stocks.Investors have failed to recognize the value of the land under which Simon’s malls lie. SPG is also a value play. Best Buy (BBY)Source: AmazonBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) last increased its dividend with the April 2023 payment. It now pays 92 cents a share, up 4.5% from 88 cents previously—the annualized rate of $3.68 yields a healthy 4.3%.The electronics retailer’s CEO, Corie Barry, took over from Hubert Joly in June 2019. Barry had the unenviable task of following one of America’s best turnaround artists. However, she had been with Best Buy since 1999 — through the good and bad — so she would be prepared for the events brought on by Covid-19 and post-pandemic.  The company is experiencing a slowdown in sales. Still, it’s one of those high yield S&amp;P 500 stocks.On May 25, Best Buy reported an 11% decline in revenue to $9.47 billion, with a 10.1% decline in same-store sales. On the bottom line, it earned $244 million, 28.4% less than a year ago. “We’ve been seeing a consumer who is — whether or not you call it a recession — exhibiting some recessionary behaviors,” CNBC reported Barry’s comments about the quarter. Higher interest rates will do that.Despite declining sales and earnings, it beat analyst earnings estimates — $1.15 vs. the $1.11 consensus — in Q1 2024. It also reaffirmed its guidance for 2024 of at least $43.8 billion in revenue and a same-store sales decline of 4.5% at the midpoint of its guidance. While I wouldn’t say anything from a valuation perspective stands out as being exceptionally cheap, it will be incredibly undervalued if, as Barry suggests, we are at “the bottom for the decline in tech demand.”  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

103,faf2b5df-eabf-32f6-a93f-07dbc5ba41ab,PPG,2023-08-01,3 Chemical Specialty Stocks to Escape Industry Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-chemical-specialty-stocks-escape-122000934.html,1690806000,STORY,"['PPG', 'AXTA', 'LTHM', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is facing headwinds from sluggish demand, partly due to a slowdown in Europe and the lingering impacts of COVID-related restrictions on China’s economy. Margins of companies in this space also remain under pressure due to elevated supply chain, logistics and input costs.Industry players like PPG Industries, Inc. PPG, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. AXTA and Livent Corporation LTHM are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions to tide over a still-challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry consists of manufacturers of specialty chemical products for a host of end-use markets such as textile, paper, automotive, electronics, personal care, energy, construction, food &amp; beverages and agriculture. These chemicals (including catalysts, surfactants, specialty polymers, coating additives, pesticides and oilfield chemicals) are used based on their performance and have a specific purpose. Specialty chemicals can be single molecules or a combination of molecules referred to as formulations, and they provide a vast range of effects upon which various industries rely. Their compositions significantly influence the performance of the finished products. Specialty chemicals have applications in the manufacturing process of a vast range of products, including paints and coatings, cosmetics, petroleum products, inks and plastics.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemical Specialty Industry?Headwinds From Demand Slowdown: Companies in the chemical specialty space face headwinds from customer destocking and softness in building and construction and industrial end markets, especially in Europe and China, due to the economic slowdown. New lockdowns following a resurgence in coronavirus infections have taken a significant toll on China’s economy. Moreover, the ongoing geopolitical tension, elevated energy costs and high inflation have resulted in a decline in demand in Europe. A weak automotive market in China is also a concern. The demand slowdown is expected to weigh on volumes of chemical specialty companies over the short term.Input Cost Pressure a Worry: Specialty chemical makers are facing headwinds from raw material cost inflation, and supply-chain and freight transportation disruptions. The closure of a large swath of factories to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted the global supply chain. This has affected the availability of key raw materials for the chemical specialty industry. Some of the companies are also facing challenges from elevated logistics and labor costs. The shipping bottlenecks have led to a surge in freight costs. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and new lockdowns in China have put further pressure on the global supply chain. The lingering impacts of supply-chain and logistic bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short haul and exert pressure on the margins of chemical specialty companies.Self-Help Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are executing a raft of self-help measures — including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, expansion into high-growth markets, restructuring, operational efficiency improvement, and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows — in a bid to stay afloat amid the prevailing headwinds. Notably, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to cut costs. The measures are likely to help the companies sail through the ongoing challenges.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a bleak near term.

Yahoo Finance Live discusses the economic impact of these pop culture events.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: I wore my pink shirt today on purpose. I want to talk a little Barbie. Seana knows I've been a little anti-Barbie overall.DIANE KING HALL: He loves Barbie, I'm just kidding.JOSH SCHAFER: I might have been a little anti-Barbie. I haven't loved talking about the story. I was like, why do we keep talking about it? This is getting ridiculous at some point. And now, here I am writing a Barbie story and talking to people about it, right?But it's because of how much we've seen Barbie in popular culture over the last couple of weeks and really coming into a lot of the stuff we cover-- I mean, we cover. I mean, Jay Powell was asked about ""Barbie"" and Taylor Swift concerts last week. But it's a legitimate question and that was something that economists told me when I was working on this story, which I found interesting, is essentially Taylor Swift, those bookings are real. The hotel or the hotel revenue is real. And we saw that in the Fed Beige Book report a couple of months ago. And then when you turn to ""Barbie,"" it's a real effect.DIANE KING HALL: Yes.JOSH SCHAFER: And really what the overall story, I think, here is that's interesting is we've been looking for things to sort of pin to the resilient US consumer, right? How do we make that sound a little bit more flashy? How do we make it sound a little bit more interesting? Well, people are willing to spend a lot of money on a movie and buy a t-shirt for it. And people are ready to spend a lot of money on a concert.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. ""Barbie"" is on its way to being $1 billion movie, you know, which is-- I mean, it starts putting it up there with names. Like, I mean, it could knock ""Harry Potter"" out of its slot in terms of these films that are pulling in massive amounts of money. It's that $775 million so far in terms of its haul. You underestimated ""Barbie,"" Josh. I knew it. Even the analysts who were talking about, I was among the camp who wasn't originally planning to see it. I haven't seen it yet. I've trying to avoid spoilers. I'm seeing some.Story continues[LAUGHING]SEANA SMITH: But I just think overall, it really points to this new era almost, like Eras Tour. I didn't even mean to do that. That we're in right now, but not so much new, but I almost feel like it's economists getting on board. And you wrote about this. You pointed to this with your story. And that's just the rise of some of these events through social media, what people are talking about, how closely economists, forecasters, other strategists are going to be or have been watching these trends, and what that necessarily tells us about future spending, and what we could expect here down the line.When it comes to the fact that so many of these economists, so many of these reports, the Fed Beige Book, like you just said, Powell last week getting asked about Taylor Swift, it just points to one her dominance and to the fact that she's able to resonate with so many people. I don't know if we're putting a little bit too much focus on what this exactly is telling us about the consumer, because her fan base is so loyal and willing to spend so much money. Whether or not that's going to translate into other areas of the economy, I think that's still up for debate. But certainly, like the economists you talked to, are saying that it's a trend worth watching.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. So a couple of things from that, right, is overall like we're not talking about like an increase in GDP here necessarily, right? We're not talking about like a major thing. But one thing I found interesting was Tom Simmons from Jefferies, who's been in the industry for over 15 years now, said he's never seen anything like it.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: And just for someone that's been around the block to say something like that, it means something, right? And then I talk to a professor at the University of Michigan, who specializes in marketing. And he said, it's really just a cultural thing. When you think about ""The Eras Tour"" and you think about ""Barbie,"" the way they've been able to make it bigger, with the bracelets, the way they've been able to make it bigger with the merchandise and make it feel like a cultural moment, we all feel like it's a part of everyday lives. So that's why someone asked Jay Powell about it, because you feel like, oh, maybe there's an impact.SEANA SMITH: I really wanted him to bite.[INTERPOSING VOICES]JOSH SCHAFER: He didn't. But I think you pointed this out in your article about the casualization of economics. We're seeing more of that, and then just overall, the social media impact that we're seeing in finance. I mean, if you think back to even the regional banking, part of that was paying to social media.]"

Is it still resilient? Those questions are the most important questions leading up to any Fed press conference, FOMC meeting, and just generally for the economic outlook.""Fed Chair Powell, for his part, didn't fully bite last week when asked about the impact of Barbie and Taylor Swift on the US economy. But even he noted it doesn't hurt.""The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy overall, that's a good thing,"" Powell said.""It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that, that will support activity going forward.""Margot Robbie attends the European premiere of ""Barbie"" in London, Britain July 12, 2023. (Maja Smiejkowska/REUTERS)And these aren't just any popular summer events, either.Reports have estimated Swift's Eras Tour could be the first billion-dollar concert tour ever.Meanwhile, ""Barbenheimer"" — the dual box office hits of ""Barbie"" and Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"" — combined for the fourth-biggest overall weekend in box office history.In the latest release of the Fed's Beige Book, the Philadelphia Fed highlighted Taylor Swift's three-night stop at Lincoln Financial Field as a boost to the local economy.Story continuesTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at Lincoln Financial Field on May 12, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Lisa Lake/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)""Multiple contacts reported that the amount of money guests spend at their leisure destinations declined modestly in recent months,"" the report read.""Despite the slowing recovery in tourism in the region overall, one contact highlighted that May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.""Analysis from Moody's shows Swift's impact wasn't just a one-off in Philadelphia, either.Moody's had seen an increase in revenue per available room in every city Swift has stopped in that the firm tracks through its report's publication July 21.Moody's tracked average revenue per room increases at all four of the cities Taylor Swift stopped at in May.According to University of Michigan clinical assistant professor of marketing Marcus Collins, it's rare for a movie and concert tour to have this kind of impact.With Barbie pink taking over wardrobes and Swift's Eras Tour bracelets dominating social media, the marketing behind both messages have transcended into a cultural moment. And culture, Collins told Yahoo Finance, is the ""most influential external force of human behavior, full stop.""""The salience of (Barbie and the Eras Tour) makes it so that it's undeniable,"" Collins said. ""You can't not talk about it because it's everywhere.""Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons told Yahoo Finance he hasn't seen anything like the obsession with Barbie and Taylor Swift in his more than 15 years working in economic research.Simons likens the interest from economists to the rise of social media and the ""casualization"" of economics, which leads to economists being both more aware of pop culture impacts and more willing to look for them.And as economists and researchers alike have turned to the data to look for the impact of these cultural phenomena, the answers have been eye-popping.In addition to the findings from Moody's and the Fed, recent data from Bank of America showed card spending on entertainment and clothing both spiked the week of Barbie's release with entertainment sales up about 13%.""There's (likely) a Barbie and Oppenheimer effect to play out here,"" Mishra noted.Bank of America saw an increase in card spending the week Barbie and Oppenheimer were released.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

However, an active catastrophe environment and continued inflationary pressures are likely to have dampened growth prospects for insurers. Some of the insurers, including The Allstate Corporation ALL, Aflac Incorporated AFL, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial, Inc. PRU and Unum Group UNM, are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Aug 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for second-quarter 2023 are anticipated to rise 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. These companies’ revenues are anticipated to improve 7.4% year over year.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q2Revenues of insurance companies are likely to have benefited from an expanding premium base, which resulted from continued rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the second quarter. Growing premiums bode well for insurers as they account for a significant chunk to their top line.The commercial property insurance rates in the United States witnessed an increase of 10.7% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, MarketScout. According to the same source, rate increases in general liability and inland marine insurance lines registered rate increases of 7% and 5%, respectively, in the second quarter. A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue an M&amp;A strategy to build diversified portfolios, which is likely to have minimized concentration risks and boosted the sale of insurance policies in the second quarter. Higher policy sales might fetch higher premiums to insurers.Story continuesHowever, an active catastrophe environment is expected to have created roadblocks for insurers’ underwriting results in the to-be-reported quarter. Per JP Morgan analysts, insured losses from major natural catastrophes are likely to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter, with the majority of such losses stemming from storms in June. Despite its associated share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. Insurers are also equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses.For insurers having exposure to rate-sensitive products, an improved interest rate environment is expected to have boosted their investment yields in the second quarter. An aging U.S. population might have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers, fetching steady premium flows.A higher number of cars plying on roads as a result of receding pandemic effects is likely to have boosted auto premiums of insurers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, persistent inflationary headwinds and uninterrupted claim expenses might have exerted strain on the profits of auto insurers.The resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing is expected to have provided an impetus to the demand for worker compensation insurance coverage in the second quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in light of a booming digital era, which are expected to have accelerated claim payments and automated processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the second quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Allstate: Its results are likely to have benefited on the back of higher premiums in the Property-Liability segment resulting from improved average premiums in its auto insurance business and policy growth in the homeowners’ insurance business. Growing market-based investment income are expected to have aided quarterly results. However, elevated loss costs resulting from persistent inflationary pressure and the continued incidence of catastrophe losses might have hurt the performance of Allstate in the second quarter.

QuotePrudential Financial: Its second-quarter performance is expected to have gained from improved underwriting and favorable disability results in the Group Insurance business. Net investment income might have benefited from increased fixed-income reinvestment rates and higher returns on short-term investments. However, assets under the management of Prudential Financial are likely to have been hit by higher interest rates, weaker equity markets, net outflows and unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts.

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.Ryan M. SimonThank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.Story continuesStephen P. MacMillanThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. -- we are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results were solid. Total revenue was $984 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93. Revenue exceeded our prior guidance and EPS finished at the high end of our range. These results showcase the power of our transformed business and demonstrate that Hologic is built for the long term with the broadest, strongest foundation we've ever had. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and outstanding balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of strength, with strong operational discipline as we forge ahead. Once again, the proof is in the numbers. Total company organic growth, excluding COVID, was rather remarkable at 18.4%. By division, we posted 11.8% organic diagnostics growth ex COVID and 14.5% growth in Surgical. Standing alone, these growth rates are impressive. Given a wider context, we view these performances as exceptionally strong because we delivered these results on top of 15% growth in Diagnostics and 9.7% growth in Surgical in Q3 of 2022, both very high bars from a year ago. And in Breast Health, as expected, we delivered another strong quarter of 27.5% growth as chip supply and gantry availability continue to improve and track to our expectations. For this fiscal year, we remain on pace to achieve or exceed our 2023 low double-digit organic growth targets, excluding COVID. In fact, our expected growth rate for fiscal '23 is now more than double our 5% to 7% long-term growth target. Based on our strong performance for a number of quarters now, combined with our continued confidence in our growth ahead, we've recently given serious consideration to raising our long-term target. But given the uncertain macro environment we face, 5% to 7% is still very much a solid long-term outlook. Put simply, there are 2 reasons why. First, -- as you all well know, growing 5% to 7% on top of double-digit growth is clearly more challenging than growing 5% to 7% against single-digit comps. For example, in fiscal 2024, we will lap several prior periods of double-digit growth throughout the year. Net, we'll be entering 2024 already much bigger and stronger than when we first set the goal. And second, there are macro business and geopolitical challenges that persist today, which did not exist back in 2021 when we first set our guide. We will expand on this aspect later in today's call. Taken together, overcoming this combination of challenges while maintaining 5% to 7% growth is, in some ways, an even last year goal than when we first established it. On that note, let's move on to our focus for today. First, we will highlight the strengths of our business that underpin our strong Q3 results. Our strengths are diverse and durable. And second, with a discussion of the unique advantages we provide our customers, we hope you'll share our confidence that Hologic is built for the long term. Moving forward to our Q3 growth drivers. As mentioned, excluding COVID, each division posted double-digit organic growth for the quarter. Equally impressive is the year-over-year consistency of our growth drivers, a direct result of execution against our business strategy. In Diagnostics, the division's overall 11.8% organic growth rate, excluding COVID, was again driven by strong performance in molecular. For the quarter, Molecular Diagnostics posted approximately 13% growth ex COVID, on top of growing over 20% a year ago. Growth in molecular was driven by a combination of both newer assays like BV/CV, TV and contributions from Amgen and HSV, each growing well into the double digits as well as strong growth from our long-standing women's health menu. Rounding out Molecular Diagnostics, our Biotheranostics acquisition continues to shine, being both accretive to our top and bottom lines. Cytology &amp; Perinatal led by cytology, also contributed strong growth this quarter, growing nearly 10%. Cytology's elevated growth for Q3 was driven by the timing of a few large orders placed in the last week of the quarter before the extended July 4 holiday. We view this as a onetime lift as opposed to a shift in the trajectory of the business. That said, co-testing, which includes the Pap+HPV continues to be the preferred cervical cancer screening method for medical practitioners. These are the same practitioners who are on the front lines who know the science and who have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact of the Pap and co-testing firsthand. By our estimates, nearly 99% of cervical cancer screening today in the United States is performed using a combination of the Pap alone or co-testing. Why? The reason is clear. The Pap test has been the most successful cancer screening test in history. Since the Pap was introduced over 80 years ago, the rate of cervical cancer which was the leading cause of death among women has fallen by more than 70%. As an advocate of women's health for over 35 years, we continue to support best-in-class care for women, and for cervical cancer screening, the gold standard is co-testing with ThinPrep, the Pap+HPV. Shifting to Breast Health. As expected, we posted another exceptional quarter, growing revenue 27.5%. This strong performance was driven primarily by the ongoing return of our Mammography business as well as solid contributions from service. In Mammography, as we guided in May, we delivered more gantries in Q3 than Q1 and slightly less than in Q2. Demand for our clinically differentiated gantries remains high. In addition, our backlog is still at historically elevated levels. We are in great shape to work down this backlog to more normal levels throughout our fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond. In breast service, our business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix. Our strong service performance represents stable contracted recurring revenue and demonstrates deepening relationships with our customers.Now moving on to Surgical and our International business. The newer pillars of growth for our company that may not be fully appreciated. In Surgical, the business continues to grow stronger for longer, growing 14.5% in Q3. Revenue growth was again driven by MyoSure and the Fluent Fluid Management System. With contributions from NovaSure V5 and our newer laparoscopic portfolio. Specifically, while still early days in smaller dollars, Bolder continues its strong growth as we leverage our relationships with our GYN customers and explore adjacent Surgical channels. The transformation of our Surgical business over recent years has been phenomenal. It underscores the value of both internal innovation plus product line additions through M&amp;A, a winning formula across Hologic. In Surgical, the sum of both strategies has injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company. Our international business also continues to impress, growing 20.9% in the quarter, excluding COVID. In May, our global leadership team traveled to our Brussels office as part of our annual strategic planning process, spending a week in Brussels reinforced a sense of pride within our leadership team. We are proud of the strides we've made expanding our global footprint and even more important, we are proud of the energy and culture we've built around the world. Coupled with a strong base of talent we have developed over the past few years. We firmly believe our highly engaged workforce and purpose-driven culture truly set us apart. As we've said before, the revenue growth rate for our international business is accretive to our overall growth rate. We expect this trend to continue throughout our long-term horizon. Related, earlier in today's call, we referenced persistent macro challenges in the context of our long-term guide. When we first announced our 5% to 7% guide, we were expecting tailwinds in places like China and Russia, rather than the headwinds they have become. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to our targets and with strong performance in other geographies where we operate, our international growth remains on track. This is a testament to the commitment, grit and determination of all our employees that support and drive our efforts around the world. Now shifting gears to discuss the advantage we provide to our customers. and how we are poised for long-term success. To fully appreciate where we're going, we must reflect on where we've been. From there, we will shed light on our unwavering patient and customer focus, which sets the stage for our bright future. Our transformation has been years in the making. It started even before COVID and as we know, accelerated during the pandemic. In the early days of COVID, when fear and uncertainty led to closures and shutdowns, we delivered our highly accurate COVID molecular diagnostic tests around the globe, playing a pivotal role in helping get the world back on its feet. With COVID surges and high testing volumes now further in the rearview mirror, our ongoing performance shows that we are much more than a great pandemic story. Without a doubt, we are a bigger, stronger company with more durable and diverse growth drivers and positioned well for the long haul. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we operate today from a position of strength and continue to exercise operational discipline. As we look ahead, we are laser focused on our purpose, passion and promise and never lose sight of the needs of our patients and our customers. This is the magic within our business. Today, our customers face the challenge of navigating this new operating environment. They seek vendors who can help them operate as efficiently as possible. For labs and hospitals, pressures from inflation and labor shortages remain despite recent improvement. With efficiency a priority, when our customers think of Hologic, they see opportunity. The opportunity to consolidate around our portfolio of products in Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical that offer innovative solutions to dramatically improve their operational efficiency. Seconds can turn to minutes and days of time and labor savings throughout the course of a year. In each of our businesses, we feature products that streamline workflows and create real advantages that our customers not only love, but need. From our sophisticated automation with Panther and advances in AI with digital cytology and Diagnostics to our industry-leading gantry scan speed, and streamlined biopsy process with Brevera in Breast Health. And finally, our efficient fluid management approach with Fluent in Surgical. Workflow efficiency is in the DNA of our entire portfolio. In addition, the fact that we have specialized service teams to focus on the unique needs of our customers adds to our competitive advantage. Our customers know that when they choose Hologic, they not only receive world-class products but also world-class service. Between our robust portfolio of industry-leading products and specialized service capabilities, we create a very attractive opportunity for our customers. We offer real and measurable efficiencies that improve their bottom lines. And more importantly, improve the standard of care for patients. This combination sets us up well to meet our customers' needs, both today and into the future. and creates an incredible pathway for Hologic's success.In closing, there are many companies that can sell products. There are fewer who can consistently deliver so many leadership brands and sector-leading margins over the long term and there are even fewer who can succeed financially while also helping the world. At Hologic, we do all three. We are tremendously proud to continue our journey, delivering outstanding top line growth and profitability. Driving value for all our stakeholders and further enabling our ability to make a profound impact on patients' lives and women's health around the world. With that, I will now turn the call over to Karleen.Karleen M. ObertonThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, we will briefly revisit our divisional revenue results, walk down our income statement and speak to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We will wrap up with our guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve highlighted, our third quarter financial results were strong, showcasing the durability of our business and the diversified contributions to our growth. Total revenue came in at $984 million, exceeding our estimates, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93, meeting the high end of our previous guidance range. Now starting with our divisional revenue performance. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $439.7 million declined 21.3% and However, excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenues, the division grew 11.8% in the quarter. We are once again thrilled by the solid performance, which reinforces the underlying strength of our Diagnostics business. As Steve shared, Molecular Diagnostics grew approximately 13% during our third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. Additionally, the Cytology &amp; Perinatal business posted nearly 10% growth in our fiscal third quarter. For reasons previously discussed, when modeling, we would advise not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward to our Cytology &amp; Perinatal segment. Moving to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $360.3 million increased 27.5%. In conjunction with our Q2 performance, these results provide further evidence of strong demand for the division's portfolio of products and services. While the current care revenue growth rate was assisted by supply chain headwinds in the prior year, we are encouraged by the trajectory of the business and the increasing predictability of our semiconductor chip supply. Moving next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $157.3 million increased nearly 15% compared to the prior year. Our internal R&amp;D efforts, international execution and recent laparoscopic acquisitions have contributed to an increasingly diverse and robust business. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $27.1 million was also very strong, increasing 25%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&amp;L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven by strong performance in our base business, and COVID-19 testing revenues, which came in slightly above our expectations. Total operating expenses of $313.9 million in the third quarter increased nominally by 0.9%. This increase was driven by higher sales and R&amp;D expenses, but partially offset by lower marketing spend. Below operating income, other income once again represented a gain in our fiscal third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as interest income from our cash balance of nearly $2.8 billion and the favorable impact of our interest rate hedge has more than offset higher interest expense on our floating rate debt. Our tax rate in Q3 was 21.4%, higher than previously anticipated. The increase in this quarter's effective tax rate represents a cumulative catch-up in the current period to increase our annual tax rate from 19% to 19.75%. The increase in our tax rate for fiscal 2023 is driven by stronger than forecasted domestic performance and losses outside the U.S., which we cannot claim benefit from at this time. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 28.9% and net margin was 23.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $231.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93. Finally, while up to this point, we have discussed non-GAAP financial metrics, we feel it's important to call out a noncash impairment charge related to Mobidiag, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. To be clear, we continue to be excited about Mobidiag and its long-term potential. As we've previously shared, due to various challenges our entry to the U.S. market will be materially beyond our initial deal model expectations. During our annual strategic planning process in Q3 the need to lower the carrying value of primarily Mobidiag intangible assets became evident. As a result, we booked a GAAP write-down of $197 million in the quarter specific to Mobidiag, which primarily impacts cost, but also operating expenses. Moving on from the P&amp;L. Cash flow from operations was $332.7 million in our third quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.77 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x. In addition, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of $114 million in the period. Year-to-date, we have proposed 3.6 million shares for $264 million. As it relates to our longer-term capital allocation strategy, we continue to operate from a position of strength with underlying strong organic growth in each of our businesses. With the growth and margin profile we have today, our hurdle rate to achieve accretion is notably higher than in years past. In addition, we want to make clear that while we are now open to looking at transactions that could be slightly larger, these are by no means the only targets in our funnel. We are prioritizing the right deals not necessarily larger deals and continue to be active, diligent and patient. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance at midpoint and expect total revenue in the range of $3.995 billion to $4.035 billion and EPS of $3.87 to $3.94. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $910 million to $950 million and EPS of $0.80 to $0.87 for our fiscal fourth quarter.With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly less than $40 million for the full year, a marginal improvement compared to our previous guidance. Turning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that each business should grow double digits in our fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of COVID. However, it is important to remember that 2023 is a unique fiscal year. As a reminder, part of our elevated growth this year has been due to weak comps from supply chain headwinds and COVID's impact on procedural volumes in fiscal 2022. In addition, 2023 is a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, as we move closer to our fiscal 2024, as Steve discussed, it is appropriate to model our base business revenue growth within our previously outlined 5% to 7% long-term range. Reinforce Steve's comments, this growth is even more impressive than when we introduced the target given our recent base business outperformance and headwinds from the macro environment. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect to close out the year with another strong quarter led by molecular. Our growth continues to be driven by improving utilization and menu expansion on Panther, coupled with increasing contribution from Biotheranostics. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue approximately $35 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $10 million in our fourth quarter of 2023 and slightly more than $235 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly more than $25 million in the fourth quarter and slightly less than $120 million for the full year. As we look forward with COVID testing revenue, demand and public concern for the disease continue to abate. Therefore, although we plan financially conservative in our COVID estimates, areas of significant upside to our COVID guidance are likely in the rearview mirror. It is also key to recognize that COVID is an accretive product and therefore, as COVID testing revenue shift lower in the next several quarters, this will represent a headwind to margins. Moving to Breast Health. In Q4, we anticipate similar performance to Q3, delivering double-digit revenue growth aided by strong demand as weak comps in the prior period -- as well as weak comps in prior periods. Finally, in Surgical, we expect healthy double-digit growth for the full year, but assume growth rates will start to moderate in Q4 given the elevated comparable period revenue we generated in the prior year. Moving down the P&amp;L. For the full year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated temporary elevated cost pressures in our guidance. On this point, we remind everyone that our elevated cost profile is less related to current movements in spot prices, which have been receiving. For example, one of the primary drivers of our higher assumed costs is semiconductor chips, we have previously procured at higher prices. As we work down our backlog in Breast Health, we'll see this higher cost amortized through the P&amp;L over the next several quarters and persist into our fiscal 2024. We continue to work down the P&amp;L. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be relatively flat compared to Q3. Below operating income, we assume that other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $10 million in Q4. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 249 million for the full year. To conclude, our strong third quarter results highlights a durable business that is poised to sustainably grow over the long term. Our growth in the quarter was diverse, with each business again growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. As we close out our fiscal 2023 and look to 2024, we are excited about the unique growth drivers in each of our franchises and the optionality provided by our pristine balance sheet. Our stakeholders can count on Hologic to deliver against our financial commitments while also advancing the global state of women's health. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Will take our first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.Patrick Bernard DonnellySteve, maybe we can start on the molecular side, obviously, started to come up against some more difficult comps here. You guys have put up some good numbers. Can you just talk about the underlying performance here? I know you've called out a few growth assays, the Panther usage on non-COVID assays a bit. any metrics? I know you guys don't want to talk utilization anymore, but any metrics you can point to just in terms of the future growth, obviously a big contributor to that 5% to 7% next year as well, I'm sure. I just wanted to dive into that a little bit.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. I think the big piece. We've got, obviously, the core women's health menu continues to do well. And I think what keeps getting not fully appreciated, Patrick, is all those additional Panthers we placed during COVID. We kept saying many of those are going to be adopting our new menu, and that's exactly what we're seeing playing out. So the core women's health menu, frankly, some of the virals especially outside the United States, and then the new products, the organic growth of BV/CV, which has really just been off to a tremendous start. And while that's not going to exactly replace COVID, certainly not at its peak, it rapidly will become one of the largest assays we've ever developed organically. So I think we just keep seeing tremendous growth for really years to come as they keep ramping up. Karleen?Karleen M. ObertonYes. And I would just add that Biotheranostics continues to be a strong double-digit grower contributing to the molecular performance.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. Almost turned that (inaudible)Patrick Bernard DonnellyYes. And then, Karleen, maybe one on the margins. You talked a little bit about some of the headwinds, whether it's pandemic COVID or the chip cost. Second half, I think the second half is 28% and change in terms of the out margins. I believe the Street is almost 31% next year. So what's the right way to think about just the cadence as we work our way into next year. You obviously talked a little bit about the growth, but on that margin side, do some of those headwinds alleviate or should we be resetting next year a little closer to what we're seeing the exit rate at here on the margin side?Karleen M. ObertonYes. So a couple of comments. First, we haven't provided guidance for fiscal '24, and we're not doing that on this call. I would say that what we're seeing here in Q3 and Q4 for operating margins in that range are probably the trough of the low, and we do expect margins to improve over the course of '24. Again, we haven't given that exact percentage, but would expect them to improve from here as some of the inflationary pressures do abate over time.OperatorWe will take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham &amp; Company.Michael Stephen MatsonYes. Let's see here. So I guess just starting with the comments on China and Russia, maybe you can provide a little more detail there. Can you talk about, I guess, Russia exposure? How much is that? Is that going to 0 because of the latest sanctions? And then China, do you think there's kind of a longer-term slowdown in your business there?Stephen P. MacMillanYes, Mike, I think Russia for us was really opportunistic. When we developed our strat plan, we went to the 5% to 7%. We were virtually nonexistent in Russia, but we had big plans to expand. So the good part is we're not losing business. It's really the lack of the opportunity and the upside. China, frankly, we're pretty happy that only 2% to 3% of our revenue comes from China right now given all of the issues going on there. So again, I think we've been able to weather that storm reasonably well. And again, it's just not going to be the growth that we would have expected. So I think that the higher way to think about this is when we put out the 5% to 7%, we saw China and Russia becoming clearly accretive to that. They're now -- Russia is effectively flatlined at 0, and China is not the headwind or the tailwind that we had hoped. So what it really means is our core businesses and our core geographies are growing even faster than what we had originally modeled at that time.Michael Stephen MatsonOkay. And just in terms of your operating margin, I have to go back pretty far because of the Aesthetics deal, but I think it was like '20 -- fiscal 2016, it was kind of in the 33% to 34% range. Is there any reason in the longer term that you can't get back to those levels and that decline from the kind of low 30s to the high 20s that you're at now. Obviously, we have COVID in between you, but I mean, is that decline for the kind of non-COVID business really all due to inflation? Or are there other factors? Because the business mix didn't really look that different back then.Karleen M. ObertonYes. So I'll tackle this with a couple of points. So one, from a earnings growth. If we talk about the 5% to 7% top line we ground ourselves in growing EPS faster than that and likely in that double digit, low double-digit range. If we want to ground ourselves in operating margins, we point you to Q2 '20, which was 31.5%. I think compared -- going back to 2016, I think the business is a little more diversified and probably a growing business outside the U.S. compared to 2016.So as we know, OUS has been growing double digits on the top line, but there is kind of diluted from the total margin perspective. And then as we kind of move out of 2030 into '24, as I talked about, it looks like this back half of '23 is kind of the low point of the 29%. We would expect continuing improvement into '24 as higher costs on the semiconductor as well as other higher inflationary pressures such as freight continue to abate over the course of the year. So I think what we try to manage, again, growing EPS low double digit and still investing in things like R&amp;D and marketing initiatives to grow the top line, not exactly driving to that historical operating margin percentage.OperatorWe will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.Jack MeehanSteve. So the #1 question I've been getting on Hologic is actually related to Illumina. So I was wondering if you could just share some brief thoughts on your decision to join as Chairman there and just comment on your ongoing commitment to Hologic as Chairman and CEO?Stephen P. MacMillanYes, sure. Let's be really clear. I'm at Hologic through the end of my useful life in terms of what I've worked for, built for. And as a reminder to everybody, I am personally a top 15 shareholder in Hologic. So this is my day job. This is my passion. This is my love. What I have to see is the company 5 minutes away, that's troubled that I thought, frankly, I could also help out in a different role, which is as Chairman of the Board. And I'm very proud that I think I can do both. If I didn't have the great team around me at Hologic wouldn't be able to. Frankly, over there, it's going to be about also just getting a great CEO in place. And we're making a couple of key decisions there, which are probably pretty obvious. And then it's going to be a normal chairmanship from there. So this is my love and my passion and frankly, where I'm fully engaged. Sometimes more than my teams would like.Karleen M. ObertonI would add. (inaudible) Jack, that last week, we had all the teams together for our quarterly business reviews and Steve was as engaged as ever.Stephen P. MacMillan(inaudible)Jack MeehanI love it. That's what I want to hear. Sounds good. Okay. And then another question, I think get a lot from investors is just on guidelines as it pertains to co-testing. So it was good to see the strong cytology quarter, but I was just hoping you could share your latest thinking on the USPSTF. If you have a sense for when some update might come on cervical cancer screening and how -- just latest thinking on how that may or may not impact the business?Stephen P. MacMillanYes, Jack, I think the interesting stuff on the USPSTF guidelines, as they relook at cervical cancer screening, is we don't have an exact time line. It could be months from now. It could be any time, could be late this year, early next. You're never quite sure where that plays out. I think the biggest piece, the way I look at all of this is there's the headline the day any of those guidelines, whether it's breast cancer or cervical cancer screening guidelines get tweaked. And then there's the reality of how it plays out in the marketplace with the physicians. And I think just as when USPSTF raised the age of Mammography years ago and said, women should really wait until they're 50 instead of 40 and you have those kind of shifts, medical practice didn't change that much. And now when they reversed it and came back to 40 just like that, it's not going to dramatically change because it never changed that much in the first place. We think that is very true as well in cervical cancer. The Pap test has truly been one of the gold standards, as we've said, probably has had more impact on women's health and changing cervical cancer from one of the #1 killers of women to going way down the food chain in terms of that because of how well it's been -- how well it's performed over time. And so while not necessarily the greatest procedure for somebody to have to have. It has worked out incredibly well over time, and we think it's going to continue to be strong. So it will be a little headline stuff. We still hope that, frankly, patient groups and the medical community's opinions will properly be listened to. And then frankly, the guideline shouldn't change much. But even if they do, I think very little impact to our business over certainly a several year period.OperatorWe will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.Vijay Muniyappa KumarSteve, so maybe my first one on -- just so I understand this fiscal '24 commentary, what you're saying is the base business, ex COVID should be 5% to 7%, inclusive of headwinds. Are Russia and China headwinds to fiscal '24, if they are, could you perhaps give some color on how much of a headwind there are. And when you give that 5% to 7%, should we be perhaps thinking about the bottom half just given some of the macro commentaries you made?Stephen P. MacMillanYes. The 5% to 7% as we related it to Russia and China, which I answered earlier is they're basically like Russia is just a lack of growth opportunity. So it's not a headwind -- yes, it's not an headwind. It's just the lack of what could have been a tailwind in our strat plan. So I think we feel very good about being in that range. We'll give guidance on our November call.Vijay Muniyappa KumarSorry, is China a headwind, Steve, for next year?Stephen P. MacMillanNot additionally to this year, in our minds probably. (inaudible)Vijay Muniyappa KumarUnderstood. Understood.Stephen P. MacMillanWe feel very good. I think the gist that we keep trying to say here is we feel better and better about the growth of our base businesses in all of our core geographies today.Vijay Muniyappa KumarUnderstood. Karleen, one for you. Gross margin here sequentially came down. You're talking about inventories flowing through the P&amp;L. So it looks like this could flow through to the first half of next year. Are we -- just given the P&amp;L dynamics, is there some cost controls, any offsets to this at the OpEx line item? Or how should we think about margins? Should we be expecting any expansion next year?Karleen M. ObertonYes. So I think as I had -- if you go from Q2 to Q3, the gross margin declines primarily lower COVID revenue. So again, we had over $70 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 and just under $30 million here in Q3. So that's probably the bigger as well as lower gantry revenue, which our gantries in our Breast Health business, their gross margins are accretive to the corporate average. So that explains the sequential. As I had talked about operating margins, we feel that here in the second half of '23, this roughly 29% operating margin is probably the low point and as we move through '24, we should see improvement as we have on revenue growth in the base business, but also some of those headwinds on higher costs will abate over the course of the year. And again, we'll give guidance on the November call.OperatorWe will take our next question from Tim Daley with Wells Fargo.Timothy Ian DaleySo Steve, in the prepared remarks, you called out tough comps along with macro factors is the reason for not raising the long-term growth outlook. So just hoping to get a bit more color on this dynamic specifically to breast. I think the guidance gets to around $350 million or so for the fourth quarter. And just curious if that's like a clean run rate for quarterly revenues to think about? Or is that still impacted by the chips on the high end or maybe backlog work down on, I guess, on the upside case. Just curious about how we should kind of think about that moving forward as a kind of a clean quarterly number we can grow from?Karleen M. ObertonYes. I would say it's not an unreasonable number. It's probably still a little low from historical levels. I think prior to the chip supply headwind, we would, in each quarter do roughly 1,100 to 1,200 gantries a quarter. This is below that level seemed in Q3 and Q4. I think as we look into '24, I think we're still having recovery in the breast business as we believe our backlog will be worked through over the course of '24.Timothy Ian DaleyAll right. Helpful. And then just wanted to touch on Mobidiag. So the write-down equated to nearly 1/4 of the acquisition price just rough calculations. So can you give us an update on either, I guess, how the European dynamics are going? Or any update on the USA launch time line of Nova.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. I think overall, as you know, we did about 6 acquisitions in COVID time, feeling really good that certainly 5 of them are delivering good growth for us right now. Mobi is just a little more work, frankly, to get it to the U.S. market. As we dug in deeper, a little more redesign is required of both the cartridge and the machine and what we got. We still like the technology. But as we dug in, it's just going to be further out, and that just affected the cash flows, combined with the interest rates and all of that. But we still are very excited about what that will bring. And frankly, the positive is in a weird way, it's going to hit a little later in our strat plan horizon, and the growth for the next few years looks so good anyway, but it will come in at a really good time for us.OperatorWe will take our next question from Tejas Savant with Morgan Stanley.Tejas Rajeev SavantSo Steve, Jack stole my question on your side hustles becoming your full-time hustles. I'm glad to hear you stay at the Hologic. My question is maybe one on M&amp;A. I know you guys sort of mentioned being open to deals of all sizes in your prepared remarks. And I think Karleen called out the tuck-in pipeline also being pretty active here. But any color you can share on the pipeline for those larger needle-moving assets and on a related note, you've called out the success you've had in Biotheranostics, a bunch over the last few quarters. Could that be a precursor for us seeing you making a bigger push in cancer testing, perhaps not sort of the NGS-based testing that people often think about, but like PCR-based approaches?Stephen P. MacMillanYes, Tejas, I think the way to think about our M&amp;A strategy right now and Karleen and I have been out with some of our largest shareholders over the last month-ish, and I think they've all reminded us that as you look at our fundamental growth rate and our margin profile, reminding us that, that alone looks pretty damn good. And it's hard to find deals that are really going to enhance either our growth rate as it's accelerated or our margin structure. And so we are being cautious. And I would tell you, I think it's the beauty of a strong base business, so we are looking in those areas, but we sort of have that luxury right now of time on our side because of the base performance. So more likely to just stay more cautious here, continuing to drive the good deals that we've done. Obviously, with the Biotheranostics in the portfolio, it opens up the aperture to look at certain things, but nothing wildly dilutive by any stretch. And I think we like things that already have a little bit of an established revenue base like a Biotheranostics that we can then turbocharge with our operational efficiencies and our sales forces and our marketing in those areas. So I think it will be in those areas.Tejas Rajeev SavantGot it. Makes sense. And then a quick follow-up on GYN Surg. Any update on the hospital staffing situation just on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And you talked about sort of that low double-digit growth moderating here in fiscal '24. I mean outside of tough comps, is there anything else to be thinking about? I think, Steve, in the past, you've talked about I think it was almost 1/4 of that portfolio is now outside of MyoSure and NovaSure. And presumably, that's growing better than 7% for you guys. So just curious as to any color you can share there.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. I think clearly, we figure there's probably earlier this year, some catch-up in procedures, this and that. But overall, I think there's still some of that to come. Hospital staffing is clearly tight. But I think in general, the hospitals are figuring out how to manage that. We're figuring out how to manage it and help again as, frankly, so many of our products add efficiencies, including things like Fluent. And so we're really kind of a go-to partner for the hospitals, and I think just feel really good about having both a -- now a laparoscopic portfolio in addition to the hysteroscopic.Karleen M. ObertonYes. I would just add on the Surgical business. We've really seen probably over the last 4 or 5, 6 quarters, international turbocharge for the Surgical business, a small base, but really starting to take traction.OperatorWe will take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.Puneet SoudaSteve. So first on Panther utilization. It's talked about quite a bit, and I know you've given percentages for customers that are using 2 tests versus 3 tests. But wondering what you're seeing today versus a year ago in terms of customers? Are they -- are certain customers that are using it more aggressively versus those that are not? Maybe just help us sort of understand the landscape out there in reference labs versus hospital labs. Where are you seeing some of the more utilization? Because I totally understand some of those percentage numbers that you provided in the past, those are average. But -- just trying to get a bit more color on where you stand today because this is more of a cleaner picture for utilization at this point in time past COVID.Stephen P. MacMillanIt's pretty broad-based between both our hospital customers, the smaller labs and the big labs. It's remarkably broad-based and also in terms of the menu and increasingly the geographic footprint that so many of the Panthers we placed during COVID were also international. And so we're seeing that as well. So it's hard to fully -- it's not like we can sit there and say, hey, 50% of the additional has come from a few customers or just an area. It's really remarkably broad-based.Puneet SoudaOkay. Good to hear. And if 1 -- if I may ask a bit of a broader question, this is regarding AI, you talked a little bit about it. Just given the some momentum that we're seeing in Medtech essentially for AI technologies. Just trying to understand how do you expect to utilize AI, where does AI augment Hologic's product. Maybe just walk us through a bit. Obviously, there's quite a bit of discussion out there on AI. So I just want to get a sense of how Hologic is looking at that.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. I think the simplest thing is we've had a number of -- I go back to when we refer to really things as machine learning. When you think about both cytology as well as breast, a lot of it is pattern recognition. And that's what the technology that underlies some of the computer-rated design programs that we've got within our Mammography system, but also our digital psychology that's now been approved in -- basically [EC] mark or got the mark for the EU. And we're working to get that cleared by FDA as well in the United States. Again, it's pattern recognition. And doing the same thing really within the Breast Health space. And I think it's where our installed base, our knowledge, just the sheer sample size is big. There's a lot of complexities, clearly in terms of getting them through the agency and owning the data to be able to get some of those. But I think we feel really good about the partnerships that we've been able to get and our ability to play strong roles, particularly in those 2 areas.Karleen M. ObertonYes. I would just add that we're also, even in our field service organization, using predictive analytics to predict certain part failures that allow us to coordinate with our customers to prevent unscheduled downtime, unscheduled visits, which is great for the customers and creates operational efficiency for us.OperatorWe will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with the Mizuho Group.Anthony Charles PetroneAnd maybe a high-level one, Steve, and then a modeling question for Karleen. Maybe, Steve, you mentioned aspirational top line, 7% to 9%, but you called out macro headwinds to some extent here, both just geographically as well as operational to some of the businesses. If those were not there, is it feasible that the profile is a low double-digit sustainable year, right? The organic profile has been there, excluding COVID. So just maybe thoughts on if we didn't have some of these headwinds here, how could it have settled out in the next 2 to 3 years? And then I'll have a follow-up for Karleen on the model.Stephen P. MacMillanYes. Anthony, I'd like to correct you. There was no reference at all of an aspirational number. We feel really good about the 5% to 7%. This year, we are delivering double that, is what we said, but we feel great about the 5% to 7% in this environment to be a company and people can count on for that.Anthony Charles PetroneThat's helpful. And then Karleen, maybe just couple of quick ones on the model. Can you give us an idea of what the Breast Health backlog recapture was in the quarter? And then when we think about earnings growth, do you need lower nonoperational costs to achieve the low double-digit earnings profile?Karleen M. ObertonYes. So we haven't given specifics on backlog recapture. I think what we have said is that the backlog continues to be high. It's something that will work through over several quarters to come. I think we're always looking at operational efficiencies to drive earnings results. As I think about '24, I think we'll kind of hit the whole P&amp;L between higher revenue growth, probably some improvement at gross margins and always looking at how do we best manage our operating expenses to deliver that earnings growth.OperatorWe will take our next question from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanI'll try and keep it as tight as I can. Just a quick point of clarification. If you look at next year's revenue growth, I think the Street is looking at about 4.1%. And it's like 3.7% organic. So is it unreasonable to think that we would be below your long-term guidance in capacity. Again, I appreciate what you said about the 5% to 7%, but I just want to make sure the Street is clear that at the low end, 5% to 7% or 5%, excuse me, is the right number relative to kind of where the Street is at today?Stephen P. MacMillanYes. We kind of run our business as opposed to the Street estimates. My hunch is there's a lot more COVID still in people's numbers for next year. I think what we feel really good about is the base.Ryan Benjamin ZimmermanOkay. All right. I appreciate that, Steve. And then one last one for me. Talked about M&amp;A, we're mostly focused on diagnostics, but I'm a simple Medtech analyst. You're doing well in Bolder, you're doing well in laparoscopic. But help us understand, I mean, with all the shift to robotic surgery, particularly in women's health, I mean, is your aperture beyond, say, a laparoscopic tuck-in in that arena? I mean, is it unreasonable to think that there are robotic technologies that could 1 day make it into Hologic's portfolio on the GYN Surgical side?Stephen P. MacMillanWe're looking at our Surgical business, both within the GYN world, but also things like Bolder have kind of gotten us into thinking about sort of more specialty surgery because it's getting us into pediatrics in addition to traditional guidance. So I think we're opening our aperture and to your point is understanding the Medtech world way, I think about our company right now is we're able to generate a lot of cash flow out of Diagnostics or Medtech and the ability to spend it where it could possibly give the better return as we've done with things like Bolder and Medtech. There'll probably be some other areas in that space that we will be looking at, whether -- and robotics is a piece. But frankly, they've spent a lot of money chasing robotics right now. That's also -- every once in a while that reminds me a little bit of some of the NIPT spaces or other things. So we're going to continue to be looking for where the profits can be generated.OperatorWe will take our next question from Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.Andrew Harris CooperI know we're at the end here. So I'll try to be quick. Maybe just one on sort of the chip supply and the visibility here. I fully understand you're not going to guide for '24 at this point. But when you sit here today on July 31 versus a quarter ago or a couple of quarters ago when you think about how comfortable you are in out quarters. Can you just give us a sense for sort of where you are from that visibility perspective, what you're hearing from the suppliers and how we should think about maybe the trajectory there and the sustainability of that backlog work down, over the course of the end of this year and next year?Stephen P. MacMillanYes, we're incredibly comfortable with where we stand right now on the chip supply. So feel really good.Karleen M. ObertonYes, we've deepened our (inaudible).Andrew Harris CooperIs that safe to assume that, that translates to getting the allocations that you are looking for?Stephen P. MacMillanYes. Yes.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.Stephen P. MacMillanAnd (inaudible). Yes. So we'll take this question and one more to close out the call for today.Andrew Frederick BrackmannOkay. I'll keep it to one. But maybe just going back to Jack's question around USPSTF for cervical cancer guidelines. Steve, you mentioned Mammography guidelines. But I believe ACS updated their recommendations a few years ago, maybe just in the spirit of giving investors confidence around whatever USPSTF said. Can you maybe just sort of talk about what you saw in the market following that decision, what you saw sort of from customers and their utilization patterns?Stephen P. MacMillanYes. I think all of these changes create headline -- much more headline noise that I know investors look at. I go back to even recently, was it in May when the new Breast Health guidelines came out. And our stock moves like 7% in 20 minutes. At the end of the day, these things have very little impact one way or the other over the short term and are really much more -- the way -- I've been in health care now for about, 30-plus years, moves happen glacially. And even as any of these guidelines change, they get the headlines, but the reality in practice is very minimal slow changes. Final question.OperatorWe'll take our final question from Liza Garcia with UBS.Elizabeth Cristina Mari GarciaJust to kind of quickly touch on (inaudible) since I know that. I just wanted to make sure I caught Steve comments that we're working through the backlog through fiscal 2024 and possibly beyond -- and just to kind of get some context, if that's correct, what could be the beyond factors and how to kind of think about that. And then if I could just parlay that into a bigger and broader modeling question since I know that now the 2024, but just to think about the long-term algo maybe and to think about segment mix and margins and how to think about that as we think about our models more broadly.Stephen P. MacMillanYes, I think the big picture question on the backlog is, I think we'll -- as we currently look we've got pretty much a years-plus worth of backlog, and we'll continue to get more orders in the meantime. So that will keep pushing that backlog well out. So that's the highest level piece. And I'll hand the harder part of that question over to Karleen.Karleen M. ObertonYes. So I think when we think about the long-term growth rate, we talked about the 5% to 7%, we've talked about that all the divisions on a worldwide basis would be in that range and think about Breast Health kind to the lower end of the range, Diagnostics and Surgical to the higher end of the range. And as we talked about earlier, Molecular potentially even above that. So again, we feel good about all the businesses being in that growth range. We continue to see international being a bigger piece of the business growing faster than the U.S. And as I've talked about previously, we haven't given guidance for '24, but we believe that we're hitting the low mark of margins here at the back half of '23, and we'll see improvements as we work through that backlog and some of the inflationary pressures subside.OperatorThat concludes today's question-and-answer session. And this now concludes Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.]"

""We are confident in our ability to continue to execute, and we look forward to closing out the year with a strong fourth quarter.""Hologic’s financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 is shown in the table below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 249 million for the full year. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2023 as in fiscal 2022. Organic revenue guidance is in constant currency and excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue guidance starting a year after the acquisition. In fiscal 2023, Bolder is part of organic revenue starting in the fiscal second quarter.Current GuidancePrevious GuidanceGuidance $Reported %Increase(Decrease)Constant Currency% Increase(Decrease)Organic % Increase(Decrease)Guidance $Fiscal 2023Revenue$3,995 - $4,035(17.8%) to (17.0%)(17.1%) to (16.2%)(17.3%) to (16.5%)$3,925 - $4,025GAAP EPS$2.10 - $2.17(59.1%) to (57.7%)$2.91 - $3.11Non-GAAP EPS$3.87 - $3.94(35.7%) to (34.6%)$3.75 - $3.95Q4 2023Revenue$910 - $950(4.5%) to (0.3%)(5.2%) to (1.0%)(5.1%) to (0.9%)GAAP EPS$0.63 - $0.7034.0% to 48.9%Non-GAAP EPS$0.80 - $0.87(2.4%) to 6.1%This guidance assumes low double-digit to mid-teens constant currency organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 for the total Company for the full-year fiscal 2023.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID-19, non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP effective tax rate; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net margin; non-GAAP EPS; adjusted EBITDA; and adjusted ROIC. Organic revenue for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID assay revenue, COVID related sales of instruments, collection kits and ancillaries, COVID related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, as well as COVID related license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment; (ii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iii) additional expenses resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) restructuring charges, facility closure and consolidation charges (including accelerated depreciation), and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services); (v) expenses related to the divested Cynosure business incurred subsequent to the disposition date primarily related to indemnification provisions for legal and tax matters; (vi) transaction related expenses for acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to implementing the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income. The Company defines its adjusted ROIC as its non-GAAP operating income tax effected by its non-GAAP effective tax rate divided by the sum of its average net debt and stockholders’ equity, which is adjusted to exclude the effects of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment impairment charges.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.Conference Call and WebcastHologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Jana Schmieding, known for her role in FX's Reservation Dogs, recently disclosed earning a mere $.03 for unlimited worldwide streams on FX, Hulu, and Disney.While streaming giants like Disney rake in billions in profit—$21.82 billion in Q2 2023 alone—actors reveal they can receive as little as $0 for their appearances in these blockbuster movies and TV series streamed online.Listen, I’m an actor. I don’t want a yacht. But I’d love to be able to save for retirement.— jana (@janaunplgd) July 17, 2023“Listen, I’m an actor. I don’t want a yacht,” Schmieding added. “But I’d love to be able to save for retirement.”The Abbott Elementary actor William Stanford Davis revealed that he was paid the same grand total of three cents in May, in a video he posted on TikTok last week.“I showed this to my brother, and he fell on the floor laughing,” he said as he held up his minuscule residual check. “It ain’t f---ing funny.”Most recently, Robert Carradine, who played Hilary Duff's dad on the Disney Channel’s hit show, Lizzie Maguire, added his two cents, or rather 0 cents, on the issue of poor residual pay.In an Instagram post on Friday, he shared a photo of a residual check from Disney Worldwide Services in the amount of $0.00. It was simply captioned: ""Why we're striking.""Why are actors striking?Carradine and his fellow SAG-AFTRA members—the actors union that represents some 160,000 actors and other performers—have been on strike for two weeks.They join the Writers Guild of America members who began striking in May.Both unions are demanding that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, or AMPTP, a trade association that bargains on behalf of studios, television networks, and streaming platforms, provide better pay.Story continuesWhat are residuals?Residuals are payments made over the long term to actors and other theatrical workers when a TV show or movie is rerun or aired after its original release.Previously, an actor could expect a cut of the money whenever an episode or film they featured in was re-aired anywhere.However, as streaming services have exploded, actors have seen their residual checks become smaller.The likes of Disney Plus technically don’t re-air episodes; all their content is available to be watched by anyone whenever they want.For example, as the New Yorker reports, Emma Myles still makes around six hundred dollars a year for the four guest appearances she made on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit stretching back to 2004. But for her six-year recurring role as Leanne Taylor in Netflix’s Orange is the New Black series, she earns just $20 a year.It’s why greater residual payments are one of the many ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike demands.Don’t actors get paid big bucks up ,front?Indeed actors are typically paid upfront for the movies and series that they appear in.But there are often significant gaps between one job and the next, so residual paychecks offer a steady income stream—and as Kimiko Glenn, another Orange Is the New Black main cast member revealed, starring on a hugely popular show doesn't always translate into a substantial salary in the first instance.“We did not get paid very well—ever,” Glenn said in a TikTok video. She was responding to comments questioning how much she was originally paid per episode of the Netflix show, after her TikTok video about the measly $27.30 she made in residuals went viral last month.OITNB went on to become Netflix's most-watched original production, with 105 million users tuning into at least one episode of the show, but according to Glenn, workers were so underpaid that they had to take on blue-collar work on the side.https://www.tiktok.com/@itskimiko/video/7255945397225524522“People were bartenders still. People had their second jobs still,” Glenn revealed in the follow-up video. “They were f---ing famous as s---, like internationally famous, couldn’t go outside, but had to keep their second jobs because they couldn’t afford to not. We couldn’t afford cabs to set, you guys.”Fortune has contacted Disney and Netflix for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.65%.Factors to ConsiderAmgen’s product sales are expected to have risen as prescription trends and demand for most of its medicines are expected to have improved to pre-pandemic levels despite the current macroeconomic challenges.In the second quarter, volume growth from Amgen’s key drugs like Evenity, Repatha and Prolia is expected to have driven top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolia, Repatha, and Evenity sales are pegged at $974 million, $382 million and $262.0 million, respectively.Our estimates for Prolia, Repatha and Evenity sales are pegged at $962.6 million, $366.2 million, and $242.5 million, respectively.In addition, newer drugs like Tezspire and Tavneos are expected to have contributed to top-line growth.Like the first quarter of 2023, sales of Otezla in the United States are expected to have been hurt by free drug programs launched by new competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Otezla is $587.0 million, while our estimate is $590.3 million.Also, increasing branded and generic competition for its legacy products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neupogen, Neulasta and Sensipar are likely to have hurt the top line.Regarding Enbrel, Amgen expects low single-digit volume growth. The decline in prices is expected to have reduced in the second quarter, while inventory levels are expected to have recovered from first-quarter levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enbrel is $868.0 million, while our estimate is $797.3 million.Also, pricing pressure and increased competition are likely to have continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products like Kanjinti and Mvasi. Sales of relatively newer medicine, Lumakras, may have declined sequentially, due to lower net selling price. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumakras/Lumykras is $88.0 million, while our estimate is $89.0 million.Story continuesSecond-quarter sales of Amjevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s ABBV drug Humira, are expected to have been lower than first-quarter sales of $164 million. This is because most of U.S. Amjevita sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Amgen launched Amjevita in the United States at a 55% lower list price than the current price set by AbbVie for Humira in February. Amgen already markets a biosimilar of AbbVie’s Humira, Amgevita, in the United States.Update on Horizon Therapeutics’ AcquisitionIn May, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to halt Amgen's proposed $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large-cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Per the agency, the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.Earnings Surprise HistoryThis large biotech’s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters.

Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the second quarter of 2023 were $351 million, or $0.70  per share, compared to non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $320 million, or $0.64 per share for the second quarter of 2022.  Non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 exclude items shown in Attachments 8 and 9.""PSEG's year-to-date financial results are on track, enabling us to re-affirm our full-year, 2023 non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share,"" said Ralph LaRossa, PSEG's chair, president and CEO.  ""As anticipated, growth in regulated operations, the realization of higher average hedged prices and effective cost controls across the business are offsetting the known headwinds of higher interest rates and lower pension income.  Electric and natural gas infrastructure, reliability and clean energy investments drive PSE&amp;G's full-year 2023 capital spending budget of $3.5 billion – supporting both our rate base growth trajectory of 6% to 7.5% through 2027 – and our long-term, non-GAAP Operating Earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% over the same period.""LaRossa added, ""We continue executing on PSEG's improved business mix and increasing predictability, while prioritizing the safety and reliability of our operations.  During the second quarter, we completed the sale of PSEG's investment in offshore wind generation, recovering our investment in the project and eliminating large project risk, consistent with our continued drive toward a more predictable business profile.  We have also made progress related to the pension plans.  Having previously received a New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) order that reduces prospective earnings variability, we recently executed an agreement for a pension ""lift-out"" that will further increase the predictability of financial results.  This transaction covers approximately 2,000 retirees from PSEG Power &amp; Other and will transfer approximately $1 billion of related obligations and associated plan assets to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, who will be solely responsible for all payments of related pension benefits due on and after December 31, 2023.  The transaction will result in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to the retirees and have no material impact on PSEG's non-GAAP Operating Earnings in 2023.""Story continuesThe following tables provide a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the second quarter.  See Attachments 8 and 9 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings.PSEG Consolidated (unaudited)Second Quarter Comparative ResultsIncomeDiluted Earnings Per Share($ millions, except per share amounts)2023202220232022Net Income $591$131$1.18$0.26  Reconciling Items (240)189(0.48)0.38Non-GAAP Operating Earnings$351$320$0.70$0.64  Average Shares 500500Results and Outlook by Operating SubsidiaryPublic Service Electric and GasSecond Quarter Comparative Results($ millions, except per share amounts)20232022ChangeNet Income$336$305$31Net Income Per Share (EPS)$0.67$0.61$0.06Non-GAAP Operating Earnings$341$305$36Non-GAAP Operating EPS$0.68$0.61$0.07PSE&amp;G's net Transmission margin improved in second quarter 2023 compared to the year-earlier quarter, reflecting continued investment.  Growth in Distribution rate base, reflecting infrastructure investment roll-ins, as well as a benefit from the timing of taxes, were partly offset by lower pension income and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) credits and incremental depreciation and interest expense related to higher investment.  The Conservation Incentive Program (CIP), continues to effectively offset the impact of volumetric changes in electric and gas sales due to variables such as energy efficiency savings, weather and general economic conditions.PSE&amp;G's forecast of non-GAAP Operating Earnings for 2023 is unchanged at $1,500 million - $1,525 million, which reflects lower pension income and OPEB credits compared to 2022, offset by the combined benefit of investments with recovery mechanisms, the predictability of utility margin from CIP, and the BPU pension accounting order for full-year 2023. PSEG Power &amp;

Other results for the second quarter of 2023 reflect higher interest expense and lower pension income and OPEB credits, partly offset by a slight improvement in PSEG Power margins compared to the second quarter of 2022.The full-year 2023 forecast for PSEG Power &amp; Other non-GAAP Operating Earnings is unchanged  at $200 million - $225 million.  Upon completion of the pension ""lift-out,"" we anticipate taking a one time, non-cash settlement charge in the range of $225 million to $260 million, net of tax, in the third quarter of 2023 related to the immediate recognition of unamortized net actuarial loss associated with the portion of the pension involved in the transaction. This charge is not expected to impact full-year 2023, non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance for PSEG, PSE&amp;G or PSEG Power &amp; Other.PSEG will host a conference call to review its second quarter 2023 results, earnings guidance, and other matters with the financial community at 11 a.m. ET today.  You can register to access this event by visiting https://investor.pseg.com/investor-news-and-events.About PSEGPublic Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) (NYSE: PEG) is a predominantly regulated infrastructure company focused on a clean energy future. Guided by its Powering Progress vision, PSEG aims to power a future where people use less energy, and it's cleaner, safer and delivered more reliably than ever.

(PSE&amp;G), PSEG Power and PSEG Long Island (https://corporate.pseg.com).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG's financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of gains (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items.See Attachments 8 and 9 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income/(Loss) in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income/(Loss), which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Due to the forward-looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because comparable GAAP measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be required for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably project without unreasonable effort MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain of the matters discussed in this report about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

While the capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth boosted profits.Factors That Likely Impacted PerformancesDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are concentrating on cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand and assisting the utilities. Investments in strengthening the infrastructure are allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations. The performances of the utilities are likely to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses, and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on their utility bills.Utilities have been adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios. Weather in the second quarter was mild that adversely impacted the use per customer during the period.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

Among these, key news was Biogen BIIB and Eisai’s drug Leqembi’s receipt of full FDA approval and Novavax’s NVAX stock price rally on deal amendment with Canada’s government.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:BIIB’s/ Eisai’s Drug Approval:  Biogen and partner Eisai announced that the FDA has approved the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA), supporting the traditional approval of their Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug Leqembi. The drug was initially granted accelerated approval for a similar indication in January. The traditional approval is based on data from Eisai’s late-stage global Clarity AD clinical study, wherein Leqembi met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results and confirmed the clinical benefit of Leqembi.Following the grant of full approval, Leqembi is the first and only approved anti-amyloid antibody treatment shown to reduce the rate of disease progression and slow cognitive impairment in the early and mild dementia stages of AD indication. Since Leqembi has received full/standard approval from the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will make the medication available for broader coverage under the United States government’s Medicare plan.  However, Biogen’s stock was down despite the approval.NVAX Surges on Canada Agreement: Shares of Novavax, Inc. NVAX surged after it announced that the company has amended its advanced purchase agreement with Canada’s government. Per the terms of the amendment, Canada renounced certain doses of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccines that were previously scheduled for delivery and reduced the number of vaccine doses due for delivery. Canada’s government also revised the delivery schedule for the remaining vaccine doses that are yet to be delivered. Another clause was added to the agreement, which required Novavax to make use of the Biologics Manufacturing Centre (BMC) Inc. to produce bulk antigen for vaccine doses, which is scheduled for delivery in 2024 and 2025.Story continuesAs compensation for the forfeited vaccine doses, NVAX reported that Canada’s government has agreed to pay it a total sum of $349.6 million. This amount is payable in two equal installments in 2023, the total value of which is equal to the remaining balance owed by the customer concerning such forfeited vaccine doses.The first installment will be made upon execution of the amendment, but the second installment payment has a contingency. It states that the second installment payment will be made only after Novavax delivers the remaining vaccine doses in the second half of 2024. The agreement also grants the government the right to terminate the advanced purchase agreement if NVAX fails to gain regulatory approval for using BMC to produce vaccines on or before Dec 31, 2024.Caribou Up on Pfizer Investment: Shares of leading CRISPR genome-editing biopharmaceutical company, Caribou Biosciences, Inc., CRBU, surged after it received an equity investment from pharma giant Pfizer. Per the terms, Pfizer has purchased 4,690,431 common shares of Caribou for $5.33 per share, resulting in a $25 million equity investment. The transaction, executed on Jun 30, 2023, is part of a Securities Purchase Agreement between the two companies on Jun 29, 2023. Alongside the investment, Pfizer's Sriram Krishnaswami has joined Caribou's Scientific Advisory Board.Caribou is focused on advancing its allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy pipeline, and the infusion of funds from Pfizer's will accelerate these efforts. The company will use the funds to advance CB-011, an immune-cloaked allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy currently under evaluation in the phase 1 study, CaMMouflage, for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM).This investment enables Caribou to maintain full ownership and control over its pipeline of allogeneic CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies, positioning the company to capitalize on future revenue opportunities. Through this partnership, Pfizer aims to contribute to the progress of Caribou's three programs - ANTLER phase I study for CB-010, the clinical program for CB-011 and submission of an investigational new drug application for CB-012.Caribou currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The candidate is Prothena's groundbreaking anti-tau antibody designed for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the exclusive U.S. license optioned in June 2021, Bristol Myers Squibb will now be responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of PRX005.Under the terms of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb will pay $55 million to Prothena for the worldwide license to PRX005.

(NASDAQ:PDCO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Patterson Companies The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$160.0mUS$229.0mUS$144.0mUS$140.4mUS$138.8mUS$138.6mUS$139.3mUS$140.7mUS$142.5mUS$144.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -2.52%Est @ -1.13%Est @ -0.16%Est @ 0.52%Est @ 1.00%Est @ 1.33%Est @ 1.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$150US$200US$118US$107US$99.4US$92.8US$87.3US$82.4US$78.1US$74.2(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.1bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$145m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$3.1bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.1b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$1.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$32.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Patterson Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.808. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Patterson CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the most peaceful countries and go directly to the 5 Most Peaceful Countries in the World.Recent Trends in Global Defense Spending Defense spending globally has increased in light of recent events. The Russian-Ukraine war has been a catalyst for this change. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, initiated in February 2022, has made countries more conscious of their security. According to SIPRI, global military spending increased by 3.7% in 2022. The Western countries are largely united against Russian aggression and have supplied aid and weapons to Ukraine. In 2022, according to SIPRI, the world military expenditure reached its highest, amounting to $2.2 trillion. Even the more peaceful European countries have expanded their military budgets following the war. European defense expenditure increased by 13% in 2022.The defense industry has received record investment post the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These increased investments feel immune to the possibility of a global recession as the high inflation rates have failed to impact these growing numbers. Major developments are taking place globally in defense. According to SIPRI, the increase in European military spending has been the most rapid compared to the past thirty years. 4.1% of the Russian GDP accounts for military spending. In 2022, 2.3% of the total military budget of the United States was given to Ukraine as aid. This small percentage corresponds to a significant amount of $19.9 billion. India and Saudi Arabia have also tremendously increased their defense spending. As reported by SIPRI, defense spending in India rose by 6%, whereas a 16% increase was seen in the spending by Saudi Arabia. The top three countries with the largest defense budget include; the United States, China, and Russia. According to SIPRI, these three contributed to 56% of the entire global spending on defense in 2022. The United States is one of the main contributors to global defense spending. It has a military budget of $886 billion for fiscal 2024. From 2012 to 2021, the United States' investment in military research and development increased by 24%. Story continuesSome of the Biggest Defense ContractorsThe defense industry has been one of the least impacted industries by the pandemic. It has maintained a stable growth rate throughout this time. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the global defense market expanded from $534.79 billion in 2022 to $577.19 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. The defense market is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% from 2023 through 2027 and reach a valuation of $718.12 billion by the end of the forecasted period.The business for defense contractors has been improving recently due to the geopolitical turmoil. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are some of the most prominent names in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is primarily a security and aerospace company. It is a pertinent defense contractor for the United States government. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) provides the United States with cutting-edge aircraft like F16 and F35. These aircraft greatly contribute to the United State's military strength and can even carry nuclear weapons. On July 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported earnings for the fiscal second first quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $6.73 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.28. The company reported a revenue of $16.69 billion and was ahead of Wall Street estimates by $798.54 million. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is the biggest military shipbuilder company operating in the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) reported earnings per share of $3.23 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.31. The company reported a revenue of $2.67 billion and was ahead of Wall Street estimates by $74.23 million. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is responsible for more ships than any other shipbuilder in U.S. naval history.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) mainly deals in the manufacturing and selling of commercial and military aircraft. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) provides the United States with the Minuteman nuclear missiles. This infamous missile is capable of reaching its destination by traveling 23 times the speed of sound. It can reach targets as far as 13,000 km from the original launch site. On July 26, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $19.75 billion. This revenue was up 18.4% year over year and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $1.18 billion. Here are some comments from the company's Q2 2023 earnings call: ""The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery. We do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it’s steadily getting better. Overall, we feel good about our operational and financial outlook, including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we set for 2023 as well as for that 2025 and ‘26 timeframe. We are particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter and we are confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year.""In an increasingly interconnected world where conflicts and geopolitical tensions often make headlines, it is essential to recognize that there are countries that prioritize peace and stability. On one hand, we have countries grappling with armed conflicts and violence. On the other hand, we have countries that prioritize diplomacy, cooperation, and social harmony to promote peaceful coexistence. Let's now take a look at some of the most peaceful countries in the world.15 Most Peaceful Countries In The WorldCopyright: tbotelho / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyAmidst the rising global defense spending, some countries have been able to keep their defense spending low. This minimal defense spending can be attributed to geography, economic or political conditions. To compile the list of the most peaceful countries in the world, we have analyzed their defense spending. To get this data, we mainly reviewed the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database. We have used defense spending as a percentage of GDP as our primary metric. However, this metric failed to explain countries like Japan. Japan has a low percentage of defense spending in GDP. This low spending does not correspond to Japan being a peaceful country. It corresponds to the United States policies that prevent Japan's defense spending from increasing beyond a certain limit. We have removed the countries involved in major violent conflicts over the past 100 years to accommodate such cases. Some of these countries had conflicts in the past, like civil wars; nevertheless, they have not been involved in major wars like WWI, WW2, Korea, or Vietnam War. Countries with turbulent environments and low military spending percentages have been ranked lower than countries with stable environments and low percentages of military spending. Thus, the list includes countries not involved in any major conflicts, regardless of the present status, and low military spending percentage in GDP. The data for each country has been verified manually for accuracy from multiple sources, including Global Fire Power, Wise Voter, and World Bank. These 25 countries have been ranked in descending order of their military spending as a percentage of GDP, or according to our hypothesis, from the least to most peaceful.Please note there are some exceptions for countries that have low military spending but are ranked as ""less peaceful"". We have given a reason for each of these country's ranks.15 Most Peaceful Countries in the World15. Moldova Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.32%Moldova is located in Europe. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has impacted the peace situation in the country. For this reason, we have ranked it lower than other countries with relatively more military spending. Moldova, however, has avoided involvement in any major wars. 14. Benin Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.56%Benin is located in Western Africa. It is a peaceful country with low military spending. Being part of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) has enabled these low rates. The internal crime rates have led to this lower ranking despite having minimal military spending. 14. Kazakhstan Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.51%Kazakhstan is located in Central Asia. It has vast mineral resources and a budding economy. Regional security treaty CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) has promoted low military spending rates. The 2022 conflicts within the country have led to it being ranked lower despite having low military spending. 12. Switzerland Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.76%Switzerland is a country in Europe. Switzerland has maintained a history of neutrality and has avoided major wars. The geography of the country facilitates its defense greatly. Military spending is relatively lower than in other countries in the same region. 11. Trinidad and TobagoMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.72%Trinidad and Tobago is located in the Caribbean Sea. It is a peaceful country and has not been involved in any major conflicts. Despite having a strong economy, the country focuses on peaceful policies and maintains low military spending rates. 10. Dominican RepublicMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.72%The Dominican Republic is a country in the Caribbean. Regional organizations like OAS (Organization of American States) have enabled it to maintain low military spending rates. It is a largely peaceful country. 9. Luxembourg Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.7%Luxembourg is a peaceful country located in Europe. This country has successfully maintained a peaceful environment since World War II. It is also a member of NATO that facilitates this peaceful environment while keeping military spending minimal. 8. GambiaMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.69%Gambia is located in West Africa. The regional organization ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) has facilitated the low military spending rates in the country. The country has maintained a relatively more peaceful environment than countries in the region. 7. MalawiMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.64%Malawi is located in southern Africa. It is a landlocked country and has not been a part of any major conflict. SADC (Southern African Development Community), a regional organization, facilitates maintaining an environment of harmony in the country. Malawi is a peaceful country and has low military spending. 6. Mongolia Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.6%Mongolia is located in East Asia. The country has maintained a peaceful environment and low military spending. The regional organization CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) facilitates these low rates.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Peaceful Countries in the World.Suggested articles:15 Biggest Defense Equipment Companies in the World15 Largest Defense Contractors in the World in 202210 Cheap Defense Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Most Peaceful Countries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey]"

While the capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth boosted profits.Factors That Likely Impacted PerformancesDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are concentrating on cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand and assisting the utilities. Investments in strengthening the infrastructure are allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings.Capital-intensive utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations. The performances of the utilities are likely to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates from near-zero levels.Utilities have been focused on improving productivity and their cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. The utilities continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses, and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on their utility bills.Utilities have been adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios. Weather in the second quarter was mild that adversely impacted the use per customer during the period.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated’s PEG second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from new rates implemented in the prior quarters.

However, for many growth stocks, their stock prices don’t reflect the new “bull market,” and remain depressed. Suppose we exclude the FAANGs and look at the bigger picture. In that case, you can invest in two types of growth stocks: momentum stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which runs purely on hype and analyst speculations instead of financials. Or, you could look into growth stocks that remain in an undervalued range after the selloffs in the last two years. There aren’t many that are in the middle.For the first option, I find it too risky right now. The economy is yet to digest all the rate hikes, and I would not say a recession is out of the question yet. But, of course, that’s not something anyone can predict. But what I can say with almost certainty is that this AI rally is unsustainable and will soon fall on its face. As I’ve argued multiple times before, analysts are ignoring the competition many AI companies face, and much speculation is being baked into their sales projections.Thus, the second option is much more compelling. Buying into depressed companies exposes you to growth and substantial upside potential with very little downside risk if things go wrong. There are many millionaire-maker growth stocks that fall into this category. Let’s look at seven of those.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMillionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: International Seaways (INSW)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockAn American company “providing energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in International Flag markets,” International Seaways (NYSE:INSW) has seen explosive financial growth in the last two years. Especially after Russia invaded Ukraine. As Europe nullifies its Russian energy imports, this company has been a key beneficiary of this process. Europe now relies heavily on tankers to satisfy its energy needs, and this company operates a fleet of 75 very profitable vessels.Story continuesThat’s very well reflected in the company’s financials, with a net margin of 54% and year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 186% in the latest quarter. However, the share price hasn’t kept pace, and the stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of just 4 times. Yes, growth is expected to decline in the long run, but all the possible cons seem priced at this valuation. Many also think that this company’s future depends on the Ukraine-Russia war and will tumble once it ends. That’s not true at all. Even if the war were to end today, the NATO countries would not be willing to lift their sanctions on Russia. Thus, this is a clear buy in my eyes.Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: Crown Castle (CCI)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) specializes in wireless communication infrastructure, such as cell towers. This should immediately bring Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) into your mind, and indeed, this is a very similar company. The stock price has also been similar recently, but the financials here are very different.Even though it is not a new company, it is still in its growth phase. Looking at its long-term stock price trend makes that quite evident. The company has retained positive top-line growth for almost a decade straight if you discount the one quarter of negative growth amidst the pandemic. It grew sales by 7.7% YOY in Q1, and profits also expanded by 8%. These metrics should imply healthy stock price appreciation, but the reality is different.Since the start of 2022, CCI stock has been down almost 47%. That’s even more than VZ, which is declining. I believe this opens up a great opportunity to snap up the stock, considering it also has a 5.6% dividend yield to sweeten the deal. These dividends have been increasing for eight years consecutively.Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: Smartsheet (SMAR)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockSmartsheet (NYSE:SMAR) is a cloud-based platform that enables teams to collaborate, manage, and automate work processes. The company has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the increased demand for digital transformation and remote work solutions. However, bears have been worried about the company’s competition and slowing growth. That’s true, but the sharp correction through last year has taken SMAR to bargain levels, and snapping up the stock is a good idea.As for the growth, analysts still expect a healthy 20% top-line growth YOY through 2026. Profit growth is also expected to be robust, with EPS tripling from FY24 to FY26. I expect even higher growth, considering the company’s earlier disappointments have caused low expectations among analysts. It beat EPS estimates and revenue estimates by 137.98% and 2.7%, respectively, in the latest quarter. All things considered, I expect a solid upside here.Estee Lauder (EL)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a cosmetics company that many may notice has been sliding out of the growth category. Wall Street has punished the business for the red ink, and it now sits almost 52% below its peak. Not only that, the current share price is even lower than what it was in Q4 2019.I believe there’s a great opportunity here since the business is expected to continue delivering double-digit sales growth after an 11% decline this year. Even better, EPS is expected to more than double in the next two years from $3.35 to $6.71. These metrics should cause the stock to bounce back sharply from the current trough, and analysts’ price targets imply a 30% gain on average. That’s excellent, considering the current market conditions.Zoom (ZM)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockIf you haven’t heard of Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), you could be living under a rock. This platform became a household name during the pandemic era with very explosive growth. However, the magic died down just as quickly, and it now sits a quarter below its pre-pandemic high in Aug. 2019. RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) might also ring a bell for savvy investors, as these companies have interlinked growth stories. I’m bullish on both, but I consider ZM a superior buy, even though it has lower growth for now.The company has meager liabilities with a liquidity buffer of $5.6 billion, and all the cons here are now priced in. It has also been trading sideways for more than a year and a half. Thus, I only see it going up from here.Furthermore, I would point out that video conferencing and remote work haven’t died down with the pandemic. If anything, this has only accelerated the trend towards remote work, and these trends will slowly materialize over a multi-year period. Analysts realize this and see Zoom’s sales growth slowly creeping higher in the years ahead. YOY sales growth is expected to be 5.6% in FY2026 from 2% in FY2024.Luminar Technologies (LAZR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) is among the stocks I have been the most bullish on, but it is not without controversy. The company is in the LiDAR sector, and the future of it is hotly contested and debated. Simply put, LiDAR offers much better technology for self-driving cars but at a higher cost. Many car manufacturers have started to adopt this technology, but many also think that it is too expensive to succeed.I disagree that LiDAR cannot succeed. That’s because it is still in its early stages, and the technology is slowly being refined to be much more inexpensive. It now costs a fraction of what you’d pay just five years ago, and industry experts believe the costs will fall even further. I believe costs will go down enough for it to be adopted en masse for self-driving vehicles, and since Luminar Technology is in the driving seat here, I am very bullish on it. Even better, LAZR stock is sitting at a depressed level already, down 81% from its peak and over a year of sideways action.The focus on profits has also contributed to the stock’s depression, but cash is not a factor here. This company is unlikely to run into a cash crunch with such high sales growth and guides over $300 in cash by year-end and a positive gross margin. Analysts believe the company will end 2023 with 112% YOY sales growth, which will climb to a blistering 207% next year. A strong buy!M3 Inc (MTHRY)growth stocks. Growth Stocks to SellSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.comM3 (OTCMKTS:MTHRY) is a Japanese healthcare company that provides services to the life science industry. It offers a wide range of solutions, including interactive marketing, education, content, hiring, and research. M3’s goal is to use the internet to help people live longer and healthier lives and to reduce unnecessary medical costs. To say that the company is under the radar would be an understatement, and little research about it is available in English. Thankfully, it does have ADRs, and you can buy this bargain without hassle before it bounces back up from its current trough.This company has no debt and a net margin of 21.24%, better than 94% of its healthcare peers, and modest sales growth going forward. The valuation is the most compelling, trading almost 80% below its 2021 peak. Gurufocus notes it as significantly undervalued with a fair price tag of $35 by 2026, 250% higher than its current price.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

EBITDA and EBITDA margin demonstrate our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years.We believe that presenting adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges, costs and recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods.Restructuring charges. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 we incurred $15.5 million and $21.0 million, respectively, of restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our asset management, and customer and order management software systems as well as costs associated with the early termination of certain leases. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred $5.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively, of restructuring charges primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting, and procurement enterprise resource planning systems, which was completed with the systems being placed into production in the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjustment to withdrawal liability for multiemployer pension funds. During both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $2.2 million of withdrawal costs from a multiemployer pension plan.US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $10.6 million and $18.2 million, respectively,  and during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred acquisition integration and deal costs of $51.9 million and $56.6 million, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology. The acquisition closed on May 2, 2022. The 2023 costs primarily related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding the business, and the 2022 costs included certain costs to close the acquisition and integrate the business.Loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million related to the early repayment of a portion of our term loan facility. We incurred non-cash charges related to the proportional share of unamortized deferred issuance costs.Adjusted Free Cash FlowThe following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:Six Months Ended June 30,20232022Cash provided by operating activities$          1,766.2$          1,563.2Property and equipment received(550.2)(505.2)Proceeds from sales of property and equipment17.120.0Cash paid related to adjustments to withdrawal liabilities for a multiemployer pension fund, net of tax0.10.8Restructuring payments, net of tax19.36.1Cash tax benefit for debt extinguishment and other related costs0.1—Divestiture related tax payments——US Ecology acquisition integration and deal costs, net of tax12.166.8Adjusted free cash flow$          1,264.7$          1,151.7We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures or recoveries.

There is room for further Gardasil growth as its use expands into treating males and moves into smaller cities, he added.However, the second half of the year could see lower shipments of the vaccine to China compared to the first, which may hurt growth, Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said on a conference call.Litchfield also pointed to continued price pressure for Keytruda in Europe this year as the company gets approval for expanding use in more types of cancer, as well as changes in insurance reimbursements in some countries, especially Germany and the UK.Despite those challenges, Merck raised its full-year sales forecast to $58.6 to $59.6 billion, from its prior view of $57.7 billion to $58.9 billion.Merck shares were about flat in morning trade.Merck reported total second-quarter sales of 15.0 billion, up from $14.6 billion a year ago.The company posted an adjusted loss of $5.2 billion, or $2.06 a share, primarily due to a $10.2 billion charge related to its acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences. Analysts had expected a loss of $2.18.Story continuesMerck paid close to $11 billion in cash for Prometheus, adding a promising experimental treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease to its pipeline.""We'd rather have them grow future profits and free cash flow by using the money that way (through deals),"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, which owns a 0.12% stake in the U.S. drugmaker.Merck has been looking for deals to protect itself from eventual revenue loss as patents on Keytruda begin to expire toward the end of the decade.Davis said the Prometheus deal will not constrain the company's ability to do more deals, and that Merck continues to ""look for science-driven, science-led opportunities.""""While I feel pretty good about what we have in the internal pipeline and the progress we're making, we know there's more to do,"" he said.The U.S. drugmaker now expects to earn $2.95 to $3.05 a share for 2023.

The increase was primarily due to lower LAGEVRIO sales, which have a low gross margin, as well as the favorable impact of product mix. The gross margin increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 8% compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, and higher promotional spending, partially offset by lower acquisition- and divestiture- related costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $13.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $10.2 billion charge for the acquisition of Prometheus. The remaining increase was driven by higher compensation and benefit costs, reflecting in part increased headcount, higher investments in discovery research and early drug development, and higher clinical development spending.Other (income) expense, net, was $172 million of expense in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $438 million of expense in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower net losses from investments in equity securities and lower pension settlement costs.The income tax provision for the second quarter of 2023 was $637 million on a pretax loss of $5.3 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of (11.9)%. This effective tax rate includes a 25.1 percentage point unfavorable impact of the charge for the acquisition of Prometheus, for which no tax benefit was recorded.GAAP loss per share was $2.35 for the second quarter of 2023 compared with earnings per share of $1.55 for the second quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related InformationNon-GAAP gross margin was 76.6% for the second quarter of 2023 compared with 74.7% for the second quarter of 2022.

The gross margin increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.Non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses were $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 8% compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including higher compensation and benefit costs, and higher promotional spending, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses were $13.3 billion in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $10.2 billion charge for the acquisition of Prometheus. The remaining increase was driven by higher compensation and benefit costs, reflecting in part increased headcount, higher investments in discovery research and early drug development, and higher clinical development spending.Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $19 million of income in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $202 million of expense in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower pension settlement costs.The non-GAAP income tax provision for the second quarter of 2023 was $810 million on a pretax loss of $4.4 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP effective tax rate of (18.4)%. This effective tax rate includes a 32.5 percentage point unfavorable impact of the charge for the acquisition of Prometheus, for which no tax benefit was recorded.Non-GAAP loss per share was $2.06 for the second quarter of 2023 compared with earnings per share of $1.87 for the second quarter of 2022.A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net (loss) income and EPS is provided in the table that follows.Second Quarter$ in millions, except EPS amounts20232022EPSGAAP EPS$(2.35)$1.55Difference0.290.32Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below2$(2.06)$1.87Net (Loss) IncomeGAAP net (loss) income1$(5,975)$3,944Difference755799Non-GAAP net (loss) income that excludes items listed below1,2$(5,220)$4,743Excluded Items:Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs3$498$530Restructuring costs236258Loss from investments in equity securities194234Increase to net loss / decrease to net income before taxes9281,022Estimated income tax (benefit) expense(173)(223)Increase to net loss / decrease to net income$755$799Pipeline and Portfolio HighlightsMerck’s expansive research efforts resulted in continued progress across its broad pipeline and portfolio. In oncology, the company reached regulatory milestones across different stages of cancer and shared positive results from a range of clinical trials. Notably, Merck presented data on four approved medicines and two pipeline candidates in more than 25 types of cancer at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, including investigational data for KEYTRUDA that demonstrates its progress in earlier stages of disease.Further, in vaccines, Merck announced positive topline results demonstrating that V116, an investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults, met key immunogenicity and safety endpoints in two Phase 3 trials. In cardiovascular, Merck submitted a Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sotatercept, Merck’s novel investigational activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health Organization Group 1). In chronic cough, Merck received an acceptance from the FDA for the resubmission of the New Drug Application for gefapixant and assigned a target action date of Dec. 27, 2023.Merck also completed the acquisition of Prometheus, which will accelerate the company’s growing presence in immunology and add diversity to its pipeline. Prometheus’ leading clinical candidate, MK-7240, formerly known as PRA-023, creates an opportunity for Merck to transform the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.Notable recent news releases on Merck’s pipeline and portfolio are provided in the table that follows.OncologyFDA Approved Lynparza Plus Abiraterone and Prednisone or Prednisolone for Treatment of Adult Patients With BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer(Read Announcement)FDA Accepted Application for Merck’s KEYTRUDA Plus Chemotherapy as Treatment for Advanced or Unresectable Biliary Tract Cancer(Read Announcement)Merck’s KEYTRUDA Plus Chemotherapy Before Surgery and Continued as a Single Agent After Surgery Reduced the Risk of Event-Free Survival Events by 42% Versus Pre-Operative Chemotherapy in Resectable Stage II, IIIA or IIIB NSCLC(Read Announcement)Merck and Moderna Initiated Phase 3 Study Evaluating V940 (mRNA-4157) In Combination With KEYTRUDA for Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Resected High-Risk (Stage IIB-IV) Melanoma(Read Announcement)Merck and Moderna Announced mRNA-4157 (V940) in Combination With KEYTRUDA Demonstrated a Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Patients With High-Risk Stage III/IV Melanoma Following Complete Resection Versus KEYTRUDA(Read Announcement)KEYTRUDA Plus Chemotherapy Significantly Improved Overall Survival Versus Chemotherapy Alone as First-Line Treatment for Unresectable Advanced Pleural Mesothelioma(Read Announcement)KEYTRUDA Plus Lenvima Demonstrated Long-Term, Durable Survival Benefit Versus Sunitinib as First-Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced RCC(Read Announcement)Merck Announced Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 Trial Met Primary Endpoint of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer(Read Announcement)KEYTRUDA Plus Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy Met Primary Endpoint of PFS as First-Line Treatment in Patients With HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma(Read Announcement)VaccinesMerck Announced V116, an Investigational, 21-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Specifically Designed for Adults, Met Key Immunogenicity and Safety Endpoints in Two Phase 3 Trials(Read Announcement)Other Pipeline UpdatesFDA Approved New Indication for Merck’s PREVYMIS for Prevention of Cytomegalovirus Disease in High-Risk Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients(Read Announcement)Merck Presented Phase 2a Data for Efinopegdutide (MK-6024), an Investigational GLP-1/Glucagon Receptor Co-agonist, in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, at EASL 2023; Additionally, Efinopegdutide Was Granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the Treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)(Read Announcement)Merck Received Positive European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Opinion for Gefapixant(Read Announcement)Full-Year 2023 Financial OutlookThe following table summarizes the company’s full-year financial outlook.Sales*$58.6 to $59.6 billionNon-GAAP Gross margin2Approximately 77%Non-GAAP Operating expenses2**$34.0 to $34.6 billionNon-GAAP Other (income) expense, net2Approximately $100 millionNon-GAAP Effective tax rate2***30.5% to 31.5%Non-GAAP EPS2****$2.95 to $3.05Share count (assuming dilution)2.55 billion*Includes approximately $1.0 billion of LAGEVRIO sales.

Outlook does not assume any additional significant potential business development transactions.***Includes a negative impact of 15 percentage points from the one-time charge for the acquisition of Prometheus.****Includes $4.53 of one-time charges related to the Prometheus and Imago acquisitions and upfront payment to Kelun-Biotech.Merck has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, given it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including intangible asset impairment charges, legal settlements, and gains and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds, without unreasonable effort. These items are inherently difficult to forecast and could have a significant impact on the company’s future GAAP results.Merck continues to experience strong global demand for key growth products, particularly in oncology and vaccines. As a result, Merck is raising and narrowing its full-year sales outlook. Merck now expects full-year sales to be between $58.6 billion and $59.6 billion, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2 percentage points, at mid-July 2023 exchange rates. This full-year outlook continues to include approximately $1.0 billion of LAGEVRIO sales.Merck’s full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, including an unfavorable impact of approximately 15 percentage points from the non-tax deductible one-time charge for the acquisition of Prometheus.Merck now expects its full-year non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.95 and $3.05, including a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 5 percentage points, at mid-July 2023 exchange rates. This revised non-GAAP EPS range reflects the following, which were not previously included in the outlook:Additional strength in the business of approximately $0.24 per share.A charge of $10.2 billion, or $4.02 per share, for the acquisition of Prometheus.Estimated 2023 expense of approximately $0.14 per share to be incurred to finance the Prometheus acquisition and to advance the acquired assets.A less than 1%, or approximately $0.02 per share, incremental negative impact of foreign exchange.The non-GAAP EPS range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and costs related to restructuring programs, as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities, and a previously disclosed charge related to settlements with certain plaintiffs in the Zetia antitrust litigation.Earnings Conference CallInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the earnings conference call on Tuesday, Aug. 1, at 8 a.m. ET via this weblink.

Sales of Gardasil, which prevents cancers caused by HPV, jumped 47% to $2.5 billion, also well above Wall Street estimates of $2.1 billion.Merck CEO Rob Davis said Keytruda's strength is coming from within the United States and internationally, and is increasingly being used ahead of other treatments.""It's really driven by very strong uptake as we're continuing to move into earlier lines of cancer,"" Davis said in an interview. He added that Keytruda was being used more often against a particularly aggressive form of cancer known as triple negative breast cancer, contributing to its sales strength.Use of Gardasil in China was the biggest driver of growth for the vaccine, Davis said. There is room for further Gardasil growth as its use expands into treating males and moves into smaller cities, he added.Sales of Lagevrio plunged to $200 million in the quarter from $1.2 billion a year earlier as demand for COVID-19 therapeutics dissipated amid low infection rates.The company posted an adjusted loss of $5.2 billion, or $2.06 a share, primarily due to a $10.2 billion charge related to its acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences. Analysts had expected a loss of $2.18.Last year, the company reported second-quarter earnings of $4.7 billion, or $1.87 a share.It paid close to $11 billion in cash for Prometheus, adding a promising experimental treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease to its pipeline.Story continuesMerck has been looking for deals to protect itself from eventual revenue loss as patents on Keytruda begin to expire toward the end of the decade.Davis said the Prometheus deal will not constrain the company's ability to do more deals, and that Merck continues to ""look for science-driven, science-led opportunities.""""While I feel pretty good about what we have in the internal pipeline and the progress we're making, we know there's more to do,"" he said.Merck said it now expects full-year sales of $58.6 to $59.6 billion, up from its prior view of $57.7 billion to $58.9 billion.

If you wanted to get your discount, you had to sign up during the spring doldrums of 2020.To be sure, gargantuan upside opportunities that extreme speculators enjoyed during the worst of the public health crisis might not materialize anytime soon. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t acquire value stocks with high potential for the second half of this year. Basically, thousands upon thousands of publicly traded securities exist. It’s practically inevitable that at least a handful will go either unnoticed or underappreciated. And that reality undergirds the case for cheap stocks set to bounce back.On this list, we’ll be exploring ideas that popped up on Gurufocus’ cheap (but hopefully viable) equities screener list. With that, below are the best bargain stocks to buy for H2 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBargain Stocks to Buy: United Microelectronics (UMC)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn interesting conundrum, semiconductor firm United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) gained nearly 10% since the beginning of this year. However, in the trailing month, UMC slipped more than 10%, implying inclusion among the bargain stocks to buy for speculators.To be sure, it’s a risky proposition. Recently, compatriot Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) announced that its top line may fall as much as 16% in the second quarter due to a weakened global economy. That sent other semiconductor firms tumbling due to concerns about smartphone and PC chip demand.At the same time, the consumer tech space has proven very resilient, in part because of the robust labor market. Right now, the market prices UMC at a forward multiple of 11.28. As a discount to projected earnings, UMC ranks better than 87.22% of its peers. Also, the company continues to run as a revenue growth machine and posts consistent profits, year in and year out. For contrarians, UMC possibly rates as one of the best stocks for H2 2023.Story continuesBargain Stocks to Buy: Mosaic (MOS)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comPrimarily, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) – which specializes in the mining of phosphate and potash and the collection of urea for fertilizer – suffers from economic and geopolitical uncertainty. With war raging in Eastern Europe and no end in sight, the framework doesn’t bode well for business predictability. Since the start of the year, MOS fell more than 7%.It’s an ugly backdrop. At the same time, Mosaic presents a case for bargain stocks to buy. Earlier this year, a Seeking Alpha article pointed out that MOS fell 50% from its highs. Therefore, the valuation has become very attractive. Presumably, if that was the case then, it’s the same case now.Presently, MOS trades at trailing earnings multiple of 4.9, which is well undervalued compared to the sector median of 13.61X. Also, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 8.8. While not as great of a deal on paper, the sector median comes in at 10.68x. Also, let’s not forget the cynical fundamental catalyst: a low supply of critical goods should eventually lead to high demand. I think that’s the case irrespective (within reason) of market conditions, making MOS one of the top stocks to buy now for gamblers.Bargain Stocks to Buy: Resources Connection (RGP)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7At first glance, Resources Connection (NASDAQ:RGP) seems like one of the bargain stocks to buy from an ironic perspective. Since the start of the year, RGP fell almost 12%. In the trailing one-year period, the equity suffered a loss of more than 18%. As a business consultancy firm, Resources would likely be relevant in bullish market cycles. However, under difficult circumstances, enterprises find efficiencies through layoffs.To put it bluntly, companies don’t need to be consulted on the obvious: dwindle the labor force and make each worker do more. Apply the subtle fear of additional layoffs and you’ll get worker bees in line. On a per-capita basis, this dynamic should boost productivity.However, Resources offers a talent acquisition business unit that could come in handy. Moving forward, the labor market could slacken. If so, enterprises need to be doubly sure they’re hiring the right people. Resources can help. It also doesn’t hurt that RGP trades at trailing earnings multiple of 8.82. That’s far lower than the 17.33X sector median. Therefore, RGP may be one of the value stocks with high potential.Seaboard (SEB)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comOn paper, a security with a price tag of almost $3,600 seems awfully strange for bargain stocks to buy. However, Seaboard (NYSEAMERICAN:SEB) brings to the table a discount based on key financial metrics. On a broader level, the company’s diverse multinational agribusiness and transportation business may prove resilient amid vague economic waters.At the most basic level, people must eat, irrespective of economic conditions. In this manner, Seaboard benefits from sitting on the lower rungs of the trade-down effect. People can trade down to cheaper alternatives of commonly purchased goods or they can outright cut all discretionary purchases. You can’t cut food.As for the discount, SEB trades at a trailing multiple of 9.03, below the sector median of 12.34x. Also, while the company prints a robust three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 18.2%, SEB trades at 0.38x trailing sales. Thus, it’s one of the cheap stocks set to bounce back (well, cheap against key multiples).FutureFuel (FF)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA developer and producer of chemicals and biofuels, FutureFuel (NYSE:FF) carries significant implications for energy infrastructures. While the present focus centers on transitioning hydrocarbon energy sources to renewable alternatives, in order to achieve broader sustainability, society will likely need energy diversification. FutureFuel may help in that regard, sparking investor interest.Since the start of the year, FF stock gained over 10% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it moved up nearly 38%. Despite the strong performance metrics, FF still ranks among the bargain stocks to buy. For one thing, in the trailing five years, it’s down 29%.More importantly, the market prices FutureFuel shares at a trailing multiple of 8.59. In contrast, the sector median clocks in at 19.89X. Also, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 24.5%, outpacing nearly 83% of its peers. Nevertheless, FF trades at 0.98 times trailing sales. Thus, it has the potential to be one of the best stocks for H2 2023.Fonar (FONR)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comA medical diagnostics and research firm, Fonar (NASDAQ:FONR) specializes in advanced MRI scanning machines. Unlike traditional equipment, however, Fonar’s MRI enables patients to be scanned in the positions in which they experience problems, such as sitting, standing, bending, etc. It may lead to a breakthrough in the diagnostics business, hence the interest among certain speculators.However, these speculators are few in number. Since the start of the year, FONR gained only 1.5%. In the trailing year, shares have performed better at over 18% up. Still, the five-year picture presents concerns, with shares slipping almost 34%. However, contrarians might ping FONR as one of the bargain stocks to buy.Aside from the compelling “modular” MRI narrative, FONR trades at a trailing multiple of 11.55. In contrast, the sector median stat stands at a much loftier 23.72X. Also, the market prices shares at a tangible book multiple of 0.76. That’s lower than 92.31% of the competition.Hello Group (MOMO)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA quirky idea for bargain stocks to buy, China-based Hello Group (NASDAQ:MOMO) is a leading player in its home nation’s online social networking space. Per the language of the company’s website, Hello Group enables users “…to discover new relationships, expand their social connections and build meaningful interactions.” These interactions include romantic relationships, as per Hello’s 2018 dating app acquisition.To be sure, MOMO presents high risks. Just look at its five-year chart. A loss of 75% will quickly force a loss of appetite for conservative investors. At the same time, MOMO’s on a resurgence. In the trailing one-year period, shares gained almost 126%.Given the slow but steady recovery in the Chinese economy, pent-up demand for social interactions may be exercised. And that’s what really makes MOMO’s forward multiple of 7.58 so attractive. Ranked lower than 88.89% of its peers, Hello Group offers a relevant and wanted service. Therefore, it’s one of the top stocks to buy now for speculators.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The increases in Net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS were primarily due to higher sales and higher pre-tax margin. Fiscal 2023 third quarter adjusted EPS was $3.01, up 13.2% compared to $2.66 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher sales.Pre-tax margin was 21.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 17.5% in the same period last year.

Free cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $240 million, compared to $327 million in the same period last year. Decreases in cash flow provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily driven by higher working capital and higher income tax payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income.Fiscal Year 2023 OutlookThe table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2023.

The increase was led by the year-over-year impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans.Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization - Fiscal 2023 third quarter Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense was $27.2 million, up $1.3 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2022.Tax - On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 15.5% compared to 14.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 14.1% compared to 14.5% in the prior year.Share repurchases - During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $61.8 million. At June 30, 2023, $1.0 billion remained available under our existing share repurchase authorization.Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) - ROIC was 20.9% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 12.8% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by higher pre-tax income, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher invested capital.DefinitionsNon-GAAP Measures - Organic sales, total segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, and ROIC are non-GAAP measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in the attachments to this release.Organic ARR - Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a key metric that enables measurement of progress in growing our recurring revenue business. It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in the current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. We believe that Organic ARR provides useful information to investors because it reflects our recurring revenue performance period over period without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. Organic ARR growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measure of ARR may be different from measures used by other companies. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog.Total ARR - Total ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Total ARR on a constant currency basis. Total ARR includes acquisitions even if there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. We believe that Total ARR provides useful information to investors because it reflects our recurring revenue performance period over period including the effect of acquisitions.Conference CallA conference call to discuss the quarterly results will be held at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on August 1, 2023.

Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022:Three Months Ended June 30,20232022Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesNorth America$1,260.9$4.3$(4.9)$1,261.5$1,239.9EMEA494.415.36.8472.3352.6Asia Pacific343.54.2(17.1)356.4246.8Latin America139.9—1.8138.1129.4Total$2,238.7$23.8$(13.4)$2,228.3$1,968.7Nine Months Ended June 30,20232022Reported SalesLess: Effectof Acquisitions...Effect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesNorth America$3,750.4$8.6$(20.6)$3,762.4$3,412.2EMEA1,353.741.7(56.7)1,368.71,056.2Asia Pacific974.212.2(68.8)1,030.8791.9Latin America416.8—6.8410.0373.8Total$6,495.1$62.5$(139.3)$6,571.9$5,634.1The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for our operating segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022:Three Months Ended June 30,20232022Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesIntelligent Devices$968.1$21.2$(3.8)$950.7$878.3Software &amp; Control750.6—(4.6)755.2606.9Lifecycle Services520.02.6(5.0)522.4483.5Total$2,238.7$23.8$(13.4)$2,228.3$1,968.7Nine Months Ended June 30,20232022Reported SalesLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganicSalesReported SalesIntelligent Devices$2,927.5$54.2$(62.9)$2,936.2$2,587.2Software &amp; Control2,065.0—(41.0)2,106.01,655.7Lifecycle Services1,502.68.3(35.4)1,529.71,391.2Total$6,495.1$62.5$(139.3)$6,571.9$5,634.1The following is a reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales growth for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022:Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported SalesGrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic SalesGrowthNorth America1.7 %0.3 %(0.3) %1.7 %EMEA40.2 %4.3 %2.0 %33.9 %Asia Pacific39.2 %1.7 %(6.9) %44.4 %Latin America8.1 %— %1.4 %6.7 %Total13.7 %1.2 %(0.7) %13.2 %Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported SalesGrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic SalesGrowthNorth America9.9 %0.3 %(0.7) %10.3 %EMEA28.2 %3.9 %(5.3) %29.6 %Asia Pacific23.0 %1.5 %(8.7) %30.2 %Latin America11.5 %— %1.8 %9.7 %Total15.3 %1.1 %(2.4) %16.6 %The following is a reconciliation of reported sales growth to organic sales growth for our operating segments for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, compared to sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022:Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported SalesGrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic SalesGrowthIntelligent Devices10.2 %2.4 %(0.4) %8.2 %Software &amp; Control23.7 %— %(0.7) %24.4 %Lifecycle Services7.5 %0.5 %(1.0) %8.0 %Total13.7 %1.2 %(0.7) %13.2 %Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported SalesGrowthLess: Effectof AcquisitionsEffect ofChanges inCurrencyOrganic SalesGrowthIntelligent Devices13.2 %2.1 %(2.4) %13.5 %Software &amp; Control24.7 %— %(2.5) %27.2 %Lifecycle Services8.0 %0.6 %(2.6) %10.0 %Total15.3 %1.1 %(2.4) %16.6 %ROCKWELL AUTOMATION, INC.OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS, and Adjusted Effective Tax RateAdjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (credit) cost, purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to Rockwell Automation, change in fair value of investments, and Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, including their respective tax effects.We believe that adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and adjusted effective tax rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period.

The figure indicates a decrease of 15.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Non-GAAP revenues are anticipated to be between $473 million and $498 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $491.1 million, suggesting an increase of 3.2% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.6%, on average.ANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseANSYS, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseANSYS, Inc. price-eps-surprise | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteHigher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals, like automotive and ground transportation, aerospace &amp; defense and high tech, is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is likely to have benefited from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bodes well.Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided the second-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure.Recent DevelopmentsIn June, ANSYS expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.Story continuesIn May, the company announced the acquisition of Diakopto, a provider of Electronic Design Automation solutions for integrated circuit development. The acquisition is expected to enable design engineers to ""shift left,"" detecting interconnect parasitic problems early in the design cycle and minimizing costly iterations in the design cycle.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ANSYS this time around.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the most peaceful countries and go directly to the 5 Most Peaceful Countries in the World.Recent Trends in Global Defense Spending Defense spending globally has increased in light of recent events. The Russian-Ukraine war has been a catalyst for this change. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, initiated in February 2022, has made countries more conscious of their security. According to SIPRI, global military spending increased by 3.7% in 2022. The Western countries are largely united against Russian aggression and have supplied aid and weapons to Ukraine. In 2022, according to SIPRI, the world military expenditure reached its highest, amounting to $2.2 trillion. Even the more peaceful European countries have expanded their military budgets following the war. European defense expenditure increased by 13% in 2022.The defense industry has received record investment post the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These increased investments feel immune to the possibility of a global recession as the high inflation rates have failed to impact these growing numbers. Major developments are taking place globally in defense. According to SIPRI, the increase in European military spending has been the most rapid compared to the past thirty years. 4.1% of the Russian GDP accounts for military spending. In 2022, 2.3% of the total military budget of the United States was given to Ukraine as aid. This small percentage corresponds to a significant amount of $19.9 billion. India and Saudi Arabia have also tremendously increased their defense spending. As reported by SIPRI, defense spending in India rose by 6%, whereas a 16% increase was seen in the spending by Saudi Arabia. The top three countries with the largest defense budget include; the United States, China, and Russia. According to SIPRI, these three contributed to 56% of the entire global spending on defense in 2022. The United States is one of the main contributors to global defense spending. It has a military budget of $886 billion for fiscal 2024. From 2012 to 2021, the United States' investment in military research and development increased by 24%. Story continuesSome of the Biggest Defense ContractorsThe defense industry has been one of the least impacted industries by the pandemic. It has maintained a stable growth rate throughout this time. According to a report by the Business Research Company, the global defense market expanded from $534.79 billion in 2022 to $577.19 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. The defense market is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% from 2023 through 2027 and reach a valuation of $718.12 billion by the end of the forecasted period.The business for defense contractors has been improving recently due to the geopolitical turmoil. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are some of the most prominent names in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is primarily a security and aerospace company. It is a pertinent defense contractor for the United States government. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) provides the United States with cutting-edge aircraft like F16 and F35. These aircraft greatly contribute to the United State's military strength and can even carry nuclear weapons. On July 18, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) reported earnings for the fiscal second first quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $6.73 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.28. The company reported a revenue of $16.69 billion and was ahead of Wall Street estimates by $798.54 million. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is the biggest military shipbuilder company operating in the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) reported earnings per share of $3.23 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.31. The company reported a revenue of $2.67 billion and was ahead of Wall Street estimates by $74.23 million. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is responsible for more ships than any other shipbuilder in U.S. naval history.The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) mainly deals in the manufacturing and selling of commercial and military aircraft. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) provides the United States with the Minuteman nuclear missiles. This infamous missile is capable of reaching its destination by traveling 23 times the speed of sound. It can reach targets as far as 13,000 km from the original launch site. On July 26, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported a revenue of $19.75 billion. This revenue was up 18.4% year over year and ahead of Wall Street estimates by $1.18 billion. Here are some comments from the company's Q2 2023 earnings call: ""The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery. We do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it’s steadily getting better. Overall, we feel good about our operational and financial outlook, including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we set for 2023 as well as for that 2025 and ‘26 timeframe. We are particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter and we are confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year.""In an increasingly interconnected world where conflicts and geopolitical tensions often make headlines, it is essential to recognize that there are countries that prioritize peace and stability. On one hand, we have countries grappling with armed conflicts and violence. On the other hand, we have countries that prioritize diplomacy, cooperation, and social harmony to promote peaceful coexistence. Let's now take a look at some of the most peaceful countries in the world.15 Most Peaceful Countries In The WorldCopyright: tbotelho / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyAmidst the rising global defense spending, some countries have been able to keep their defense spending low. This minimal defense spending can be attributed to geography, economic or political conditions. To compile the list of the most peaceful countries in the world, we have analyzed their defense spending. To get this data, we mainly reviewed the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database. We have used defense spending as a percentage of GDP as our primary metric. However, this metric failed to explain countries like Japan. Japan has a low percentage of defense spending in GDP. This low spending does not correspond to Japan being a peaceful country. It corresponds to the United States policies that prevent Japan's defense spending from increasing beyond a certain limit. We have removed the countries involved in major violent conflicts over the past 100 years to accommodate such cases. Some of these countries had conflicts in the past, like civil wars; nevertheless, they have not been involved in major wars like WWI, WW2, Korea, or Vietnam War. Countries with turbulent environments and low military spending percentages have been ranked lower than countries with stable environments and low percentages of military spending. Thus, the list includes countries not involved in any major conflicts, regardless of the present status, and low military spending percentage in GDP. The data for each country has been verified manually for accuracy from multiple sources, including Global Fire Power, Wise Voter, and World Bank. These 25 countries have been ranked in descending order of their military spending as a percentage of GDP, or according to our hypothesis, from the least to most peaceful.Please note there are some exceptions for countries that have low military spending but are ranked as ""less peaceful"". We have given a reason for each of these country's ranks.15 Most Peaceful Countries in the World15. Moldova Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.32%Moldova is located in Europe. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has impacted the peace situation in the country. For this reason, we have ranked it lower than other countries with relatively more military spending. Moldova, however, has avoided involvement in any major wars. 14. Benin Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.56%Benin is located in Western Africa. It is a peaceful country with low military spending. Being part of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) has enabled these low rates. The internal crime rates have led to this lower ranking despite having minimal military spending. 14. Kazakhstan Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.51%Kazakhstan is located in Central Asia. It has vast mineral resources and a budding economy. Regional security treaty CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) has promoted low military spending rates. The 2022 conflicts within the country have led to it being ranked lower despite having low military spending. 12. Switzerland Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.76%Switzerland is a country in Europe. Switzerland has maintained a history of neutrality and has avoided major wars. The geography of the country facilitates its defense greatly. Military spending is relatively lower than in other countries in the same region. 11. Trinidad and TobagoMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.72%Trinidad and Tobago is located in the Caribbean Sea. It is a peaceful country and has not been involved in any major conflicts. Despite having a strong economy, the country focuses on peaceful policies and maintains low military spending rates. 10. Dominican RepublicMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.72%The Dominican Republic is a country in the Caribbean. Regional organizations like OAS (Organization of American States) have enabled it to maintain low military spending rates. It is a largely peaceful country. 9. Luxembourg Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.7%Luxembourg is a peaceful country located in Europe. This country has successfully maintained a peaceful environment since World War II. It is also a member of NATO that facilitates this peaceful environment while keeping military spending minimal. 8. GambiaMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.69%Gambia is located in West Africa. The regional organization ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) has facilitated the low military spending rates in the country. The country has maintained a relatively more peaceful environment than countries in the region. 7. MalawiMilitary Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.64%Malawi is located in southern Africa. It is a landlocked country and has not been a part of any major conflict. SADC (Southern African Development Community), a regional organization, facilitates maintaining an environment of harmony in the country. Malawi is a peaceful country and has low military spending. 6. Mongolia Military Spending as a Percentage of GDP: 0.6%Mongolia is located in East Asia. The country has maintained a peaceful environment and low military spending. The regional organization CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) facilitates these low rates.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Peaceful Countries in the World.Suggested articles:15 Biggest Defense Equipment Companies in the World15 Largest Defense Contractors in the World in 202210 Cheap Defense Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 Most Peaceful Countries in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey]"

She said at an event in Washington last week that she plans to go to China “later this summer” but is “still finalizing a date and plans.”Raimondo, whose emails were hacked earlier this month in a breach tied to China, has been at the forefront of White House efforts to curb Beijing’s access to advanced technology, including export controls announced last year.Her trip could come at a sensitive time in the bilateral relationship, with Biden set to sign an order curbing critical US technology investments in China by mid-August.On her first trip to China as commerce secretary, Raimondo would be the fourth high-level member of President Joe Biden’s administration to visit since June, following Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and climate envoy John Kerry.The earlier visits by top administration officials have yet to deliver significant public results beyond agreeing to further dialogue. The White House is looking to smooth ties with Beijing following months of heightened tensions over incidents including an alleged spy balloon, the US export controls on computer chip technology and military encounters in the South China Sea.Story continuesRead more: Biden to Sign Order Curbing China Tech Investments by Mid-AugustOutbound InvestmentThe planned executive order on outbound investment focuses on deals in the semiconductor, quantum computing and artificial intelligence sectors. It would only prohibit certain transactions and not affect existing investments, but the curbs have sparked anger from Beijing, which views them as an effort to isolate and control China.One likely deliverable from a Raimondo trip is a working group between her department and China’s commerce ministry to discuss US export controls aimed at preventing cutting-edge American technology from being used by China’s military, the people familiar with the planning said.The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security uses the controls to limit Beijing’s access to computer chips that it worries can be used to threaten US national security and American foreign policy interests. China has countered that the controls prevent its companies from competing fairly.Read more: Chip CEOs Urge US to Study Impact of China Curbs and Take PauseRaimondo is also in charge of promoting US exports to one of its top trade partners and implementing a $52 billion semiconductor investment plan to make the US less dependent chips from Asia, particularly Taiwan.“At a high level, we need to do business with China wherever we can,” Raimondo said at the event last week at the Wilson Center. “We need to promote wherever we can. But we need to protect where we must. I have a role to play in both of those.”On the export promotion side, one top issue is Boeing Co.’s stalled delivery of its 737 Max planes to Chinese airlines. China barred deliveries following two deadly crashes in 2019. There are signs that could change, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said on an earnings call last week without elaborating.“We’re getting a lot of good signs that they’ll resume delivery, but I’m not going to predict that for you,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekInfluencers Built Up This Wellness Startup—Until They Started Getting SickAI in Hollywood Has Gone From Contract Sticking Point to Existential CrisisAmazon Unveils Biggest Grocery Overhaul Since Buying Whole FoodsWith AI Booming, Gary Gensler Wants to Keep Finance Safe for HumansHonoring the Enslaved Man Who Made Jack Daniel’s First Whiskey©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

A new maintenance facility will provide shelter for mechanics while they work on aircraft in DHL’s fleet. (Photo: CVG Airport Authority)DHL Express announced Monday it will invest $192 million to build an aircraft maintenance facility to support its growing fleet at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG), where the package logistics provider operates its primary U.S. air hub.The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority on Thursday approved $1 million worth of incentives for the 305,000-square-foot facility, which will include space for aircraft parts storage, three maintenance parking gates and eight new aircraft gates.The maintenance center will be adjacent to DHL’s existing cargo operations, on 50 additional acres that DHL will lease from the airport, and house two Boeing 777 widebody freighters side by side. DHL said it expects to complete the project by the end of 2025.CVG is the main point for connecting DHL’s express network to the rest of the world, with 130 daily flights conducted by a fleet of 60 aircraft. Partner airlines and joint venture Polar Air also rely on the facility. The superhub currently operates on 194 acres with 67 aircraft parking gates and 6.4 million square feet of ramp area.  It annually processes about 50 million international shipments bound for the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America.The company has previously invested more than $250 million in hub upgrades since 2015, including aircraft handling equipment, autosort systems and remodeled interior sections. DHL also has superhubs in Germany and Hong Kong.DHL Express does some of its own repairs on the tarmac at CVG and sends larger jobs to FEAM Aero, which broke ground in November on a second maintenance hangar. The expansion project will bring line maintenance activities out of the weather and accommodate tasks for DHL’s fleet of Boeing 737, 767 and 777 aircraft. DHL is expected to use a mix of in-house and FEAM technicians to maintain its fleet.CVG is the 17th-largest airport in the world based on cargo tonnage, according to Airports Council International.Story continues“We are committed to serving our customers and their growing demands, which require an investment to expand our footprint at CVG,” said Mike Parra, CEO for DHL Express Americas, in the announcement. DHL continues to expand and modernize its fleet despite the temporary downturn in the air express market.Between 2018 and 2022, DHL purchased 28 new B777-200 freighters from Boeing, of which 19 are currently in service. The remaining aircraft will be delivered between now and 2025. In April, the company announced the order of nine 777-200LR freighters from Jetran. Mammoth Freighters, a startup airframe overhaul company, will convert the used passenger jets to cargo configuration and deliver them between 2024 and 2027.FreightWaves reported last week that Ontario International Airport in California recently approved a proposal for DHL to build a West Coast air sortation hub. Since mid-2021, DHL has invested in major upgrades for air facilities in Miami; Paris; Milan, Italy; Seoul, South Korea; Hong Kong; and Hamilton, Ontario. DHL last fall opened a regional hub at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.CVG is also where Amazon Air has its national hub that routes packages around the country on partner carriers such as Atlas Air, Air Transport International, ABX Air and Sun Country.British Airways last month launched nonstop passenger service between London and Cincinnati. The Boeing 777 widebody aircraft are also carrying cargo, and DHL has said it plans to use the flights to supplement its own capacity.757s to PanamaMeanwhile, DHL announced on LinkedIn that one of its in-house airlines, European Air Transport Leipzig GmbH, has transferred two Boeing 757 cargo jets to Panama-based partner airline DHL Aero Expreso for six months.

The company's profitability continues to be negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Nevertheless, Disney is benefiting from the growing popularity of Disney+ core, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Strong line-up of movies that include Haunted Mansion, Poor Things and The Creator bodes well for the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment.The company has been nominated for several Emmy awards that suggests a content portfolio. Revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses is encouraging. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks.(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Boeing shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+49.0% vs. +1.5%). The company remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries.During the second quarter, Boeing booked 460 net commercial airplane orders and recorded a 10% hike in service revenues. Strengthening the U.S. defense budget should also boost its growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term. Further, the company has been incurring notable abnormal production cost in relation to production quality issues for 787 jets, which may hurt its future results.(You can read the full research report on Boeing here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of General Electric have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+97.2% vs. +4.0%). Strong performance of the Aerospace unit, driven by commercial aerospace strength, significant growth in LEAP engine deliveries and higher defense engine orders, is aiding General Electric's growth.With strength in GE Gas Power services and growth at Grid business and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of improvement in GE Vernova (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) hold promise. Due to these tailwinds, the company has raised its 2023 guidance.However, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure and foreign currency headwinds are other concerns for General Electric.(You can read the full research report on General Electric here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lam Research Corp. and América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V..Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $400.04 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Otter Tail: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The new unit represents a long-term investment in the state's clean energy future and will provide reliable, emissions-free energy to customers for decades to come.""The Plant Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear expansion is another incredible example of how Georgia Power is building a reliable and resilient energy future for our state,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""It is important that we make these kinds of long-term investments and see them through so we can continue providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to our 2.7 million customers. Today's achievement is a testament to our commitment to doing just that, and it marks the first day of the next 60 to 80 years that Vogtle Unit 3 will serve our customers with clean, reliable energy.""Vogtle Unit 3 is the first newly-constructed nuclear unit in the U.S. in over 30 years and can power an estimated 500,000 homes and businesses. Once all four units are online, the Plant Vogtle site will be the largest generator of clean energy in the nation and support continued growth in Georgia as more industries, businesses and families come to the state.""Today is a historic day for the State of Georgia, Southern Company, and the entire energy sector, as we continue transforming the way we power the lives of millions of Americans,"" said Chris Womack, president and CEO of Southern Company. ""With Unit 3 completed, and Unit 4 in the final stages of construction and testing, this project shows just how new nuclear can and will play a critical role in achieving a clean energy future for the United States. Bringing this unit safely into service is a credit to the hard work and dedication of our teams at Southern Company and the thousands of additional workers who have helped build that future at this site, as well as all of the partners who have helped make this day a reality.""Nuclear energy is the only zero-emission baseload energy source available today, offering high reliability, and efficient operations around the clock. Nuclear energy currently provides approximately 25% of Georgia Power's overall energy mix, including the existing units at Plant Vogtle and Georgia's other nuclear facility at Plant Hatch in Baxley, Ga.""The Vogtle expansion is an American energy success story and would not be possible without the support of strong public and private partners like our partners at the North America's Building Trades Unions,"" said Tom Fanning, chairman of the Board of Directors for Southern Company. ""We continue to appreciate their support and those who have stood with us at the local, state and federal levels to complete this new clean energy source to serve electric customers. Providing leadership in our industry and a commitment to safety and quality are in Southern Company's DNA. Today's milestone at the Vogtle expansion site underscores this legacy, and I couldn't be prouder of the dedication our teams have shown in seeing Unit 3 through to completion.""The final stages of construction and testing continue at Vogtle Unit 4, with the unit projected to be placed in service during the late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter of 2024. The unit completed hot functional testing in May, in significantly less time than Unit 3 as the team continues leveraging best practices and learnings from the earlier unit. The Vogtle site has also received nuclear fuel for Unit 4, with a total of 157 fuel assemblies necessary for the safe and reliable startup of the unit.Also, last week, Georgia Power announced the receipt of the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for Vogtle Unit 4. This finding was confirmed in an official letter received by Southern Nuclear and signifies that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations. No further NRC findings are necessary in order for Southern Nuclear to load fuel or begin the startup sequence for the new unit.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.Visit Vogtle 3 and 4 for more information.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain information contained in this release is forward-looking information based on current expectations and plans that involve risks and uncertainties.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.The S&amp;P 500 was under immense pressure in 2022, going down by 19.4% as most of its listings crumbled amid the push by the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Inflation near record highs meant few investors had the stomach to take up risk in the equity markets, all but fueling the selloff. Recession fears and the Russian-Ukraine war all but accelerated the selloff spree. Amid the bearish sentiments in the market, CNBC's Jim Cramer was overly concerned over whether the market will bounce back amid the steep selloff.The Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive monetary tightening spree in the race to clamp down on inflationary pressures that were getting out of hand spelled more trouble, according to Cramer. Amid the interest hiking spree, the CNBC commentator warned of the potential recession risk that could significantly affect investors' sentiments.The warnings did not come as a surprise as Cramer tends to be bearish on the market and its prospects regardless of the ongoings. While he has been a staple of the financial news industry for decades, Cramer sometimes gets things wrong, which has seen him become the laughingstock of Wall Street. Given that his predictions are often controversial, with a portion of them turning out wrong, some investors often shun them or opt to do the opposite of what he does.The fact that some of Cramer’s predictions rarely come to fruition has led to the creation of a Twitter account called Inverse Jim Cramer. The account is best known for taking the opposite position on Cramer's financial decisions about the stock market.Chevron was one of Cramer’s top picks at the start of the year. He insisted it was becoming cheaper and cheaper as it went down. The CNBC Mad Money host reiterated that the stock would be a winner as long as oil prices stayed above the $60-a barrel level. However, that has not been the case, as the stock has already lost more than 9% in market value and remains under pressure.Story continuesOne prediction that Cramer might want to forget sooner than later is that of Silicon Valley bank parent company SVB Financials. While making the prediction, the CNBC commentator reiterated that it will be one of the biggest winners of 2023 alongside other blue-chip stocks like Tesla and Meta.“This company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street has mistakenly been concerned by,” Cramer said in the clip.That prediction came to bite as Silicon Valley Bank went under at the height of the banking crisis that I regional banks.Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023Nevertheless, Cramer is sometimes wrong, and whenever he gets it right, there is always something to smile about. Despite getting it wrong with Chevron and SVB Financials, Cramer also reiterated that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the best stocks to consider in 2023. True to his predictions, the stocks have lived up to expectations and emerged as key drivers of the overall bull market.Even though the overall market is trading well above its recent lows, plenty of stocks are trading less than they were a year ago. Some of these stocks boast impressive risk-reward given the tremendous upside potential. As valuation concerns become a big issue after the massive rally year to date, CNBCs Cramer believes there are stocks likely to fair well even on the economy plunging into recession.Our MethodologyThe list of Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 stock picks for 2023 takes into considerations stock picks that the CNBC’s commentator predicted will outperform the market in 2023 at the start of the year. He chose five stocks from each of the groups of the highest and lowest performers in the S&amp;P 500 in 2022 that might be winners in 2023.While some of the stocks have lived up to expectations and rallied significantly others have been a big disappointment. We ranked the stocks based on their gains from when Cramer made his predictions. Overall, an equal weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks returned nearly 25% year-to-date and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.10. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)Upside Potential: 21.30%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -29% Price to earnings multiple: 9V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a big miss in Cramer’s predictions. The CNBC commentator expected the company to bounce back while betting that the new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help reinvigorate the company's fortunes. However that has not been the case as the stock is down by 29% year to date.V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)'s growth metrics have mostly been cut short by inflation and other macro headwinds. Intermittent lockdowns in China last year and currency headwinds have also affected its revenue base. Consequently, the stock is down by about 29% year to date.Consequently, V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of 9 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. In addition, analysts on Wall Street have a $23.86 price target on the stock implying a 21.30% upside potential.  9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Upside Potential: 38.98%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -23%  Price to earnings multiple: 34Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been a big disappointment as it is down by about 23% year to date. The underperformance comes against the backdrop of Cramer terming the energy company a renewable golden boy at the beginning of the year.The company designs, develop, manufactures, and sells home energy solution for the solar photovoltaic industry. While it has underperformed the overall market, Cramer believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from the clean energy push in the US.The company delivered impressive Q2 results with revenues increasing 34.1%  to $711.1 million despite missing estimates of $727 million.  The bottom line increased 37.4% to $1.47 a share beating consensus estimates of $1.27 a share.The stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34 compared to an average of 26 for S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $240.94, implying a 38.94% upside potential from current levels.8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Upside Potential: 11.90% Gain since Cramer Prediction: -13% Price to earnings multiple: 20Cramer believes Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. The company operates as an aerospace and defense company providing aircraft systems workwise. It delivered impressive Q1 results with earnings of $5.50 a share against $5.09 a share expected on revenues of $9.3 billion against the $9.2 billion that Wall Street expected.Early in the year Cramer touted Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) as one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. However, that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed going by the 13% decline year to date.While Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has been under pressure going down by 13% year to date, it's been under consolidation in recent months. Likewise, it trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $511.55, repressing an 11.90% upside potential from current levels.7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Upside Potential: 19.08% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 1.03% Price to earnings multiple: 12At the start of the year Cramer predicted Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will have a multiyear rally. However that has not been the case as it is only up by about 1% year to date compared to an 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Nevertheless, the company's sentiments have improved significantly, going by the 35% rally over the past two months. The rally has come at the back of an uptick in energy prices.Expectations that oil prices will find support above the $80 a barrel level strengthens the oil field services company's outlook. The provider of products and services for the energy industry is likely to benefit from the booming energy industry by year-end.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) already exhibits strong financial metrics with earnings per share of $2.16, operating margin of 16.21%, and return on invested capital of 15.61%. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12, Haliburton boasts of a solid 1.67% dividend yieldCramer predicts that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has a multiyear rally ahead as the average price target is $45.50, implying a 19.08% upside potential from current levels.6. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Upside Potential: 11.69% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 7.4% Price to earnings multiple: 15McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one stock that Cramer believes will do well even with the economy slowing down amid recession fears. However that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed on the overall market turning bullish. Its 7% gain is an understatement going by the 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period.McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is already up by about 7% but boasts tremendous upside potential owing to its low valuation and long-term growth potential. Over the past three years, it has delivered over 400% return. It's fresh from increasing its dividend by 15%, affirming its ability to generate strong cash flows.The stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15, backed with a 0.60% dividend yield. With an average price target of $451, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an 11.69% upside potential from current levels.Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.Suggested articles:20 Most Popular Airlines in the World12 Best Solar Energy and Battery Stocks To Buy NowTop 30 Most Hated Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

QuoteFactors to NoteHigher adoption of ANSYS’ simulation solutions in various verticals, like automotive and ground transportation, aerospace &amp; defense and high tech, is likely to have favored the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is likely to have benefited from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased demand for high-performance computing and 5G wireless systems in the semiconductor space also bodes well.Continued momentum in subscription lease licenses is likely to have aided the second-quarter revenue performance, owing to customers shifting from perpetual licenses to subscription leases.Strong channel distribution, go-to-market momentum and a healthy pipeline are expected to have contributed to the annual contract value.On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to have weighed on the company’s performance as clients cut back on expenditure.Recent DevelopmentsIn June, ANSYS expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.Story continuesIn May, the company announced the acquisition of Diakopto, a provider of Electronic Design Automation solutions for integrated circuit development.

While making the prediction, the CNBC commentator reiterated that it will be one of the biggest winners of 2023 alongside other blue-chip stocks like Tesla and Meta.“This company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street has mistakenly been concerned by,” Cramer said in the clip.That prediction came to bite as Silicon Valley Bank went under at the height of the banking crisis that I regional banks.Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023Nevertheless, Cramer is sometimes wrong, and whenever he gets it right, there is always something to smile about. Despite getting it wrong with Chevron and SVB Financials, Cramer also reiterated that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the best stocks to consider in 2023. True to his predictions, the stocks have lived up to expectations and emerged as key drivers of the overall bull market.Even though the overall market is trading well above its recent lows, plenty of stocks are trading less than they were a year ago. Some of these stocks boast impressive risk-reward given the tremendous upside potential. As valuation concerns become a big issue after the massive rally year to date, CNBCs Cramer believes there are stocks likely to fair well even on the economy plunging into recession.Our MethodologyThe list of Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 stock picks for 2023 takes into considerations stock picks that the CNBC’s commentator predicted will outperform the market in 2023 at the start of the year. He chose five stocks from each of the groups of the highest and lowest performers in the S&amp;P 500 in 2022 that might be winners in 2023.While some of the stocks have lived up to expectations and rallied significantly others have been a big disappointment. We ranked the stocks based on their gains from when Cramer made his predictions. Overall, an equal weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks returned nearly 25% year-to-date and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.10. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)Upside Potential: 21.30%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -29% Price to earnings multiple: 9V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a big miss in Cramer’s predictions. The CNBC commentator expected the company to bounce back while betting that the new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help reinvigorate the company's fortunes. However that has not been the case as the stock is down by 29% year to date.V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)'s growth metrics have mostly been cut short by inflation and other macro headwinds. Intermittent lockdowns in China last year and currency headwinds have also affected its revenue base. Consequently, the stock is down by about 29% year to date.Consequently, V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of 9 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. In addition, analysts on Wall Street have a $23.86 price target on the stock implying a 21.30% upside potential.  9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Upside Potential: 38.98%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -23%  Price to earnings multiple: 34Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been a big disappointment as it is down by about 23% year to date. The underperformance comes against the backdrop of Cramer terming the energy company a renewable golden boy at the beginning of the year.The company designs, develop, manufactures, and sells home energy solution for the solar photovoltaic industry. While it has underperformed the overall market, Cramer believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from the clean energy push in the US.The company delivered impressive Q2 results with revenues increasing 34.1%  to $711.1 million despite missing estimates of $727 million.  The bottom line increased 37.4% to $1.47 a share beating consensus estimates of $1.27 a share.The stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34 compared to an average of 26 for S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $240.94, implying a 38.94% upside potential from current levels.8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Upside Potential: 11.90% Gain since Cramer Prediction: -13% Price to earnings multiple: 20Cramer believes Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. The company operates as an aerospace and defense company providing aircraft systems workwise. It delivered impressive Q1 results with earnings of $5.50 a share against $5.09 a share expected on revenues of $9.3 billion against the $9.2 billion that Wall Street expected.Early in the year Cramer touted Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) as one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. However, that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed going by the 13% decline year to date.While Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has been under pressure going down by 13% year to date, it's been under consolidation in recent months. Likewise, it trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $511.55, repressing an 11.90% upside potential from current levels.7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Upside Potential: 19.08% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 1.03% Price to earnings multiple: 12At the start of the year Cramer predicted Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will have a multiyear rally. However that has not been the case as it is only up by about 1% year to date compared to an 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Nevertheless, the company's sentiments have improved significantly, going by the 35% rally over the past two months. The rally has come at the back of an uptick in energy prices.Expectations that oil prices will find support above the $80 a barrel level strengthens the oil field services company's outlook. The provider of products and services for the energy industry is likely to benefit from the booming energy industry by year-end.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) already exhibits strong financial metrics with earnings per share of $2.16, operating margin of 16.21%, and return on invested capital of 15.61%. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12, Haliburton boasts of a solid 1.67% dividend yieldCramer predicts that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has a multiyear rally ahead as the average price target is $45.50, implying a 19.08% upside potential from current levels.6. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Upside Potential: 11.69% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 7.4% Price to earnings multiple: 15McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one stock that Cramer believes will do well even with the economy slowing down amid recession fears. However that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed on the overall market turning bullish. Its 7% gain is an understatement going by the 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period.McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is already up by about 7% but boasts tremendous upside potential owing to its low valuation and long-term growth potential. Over the past three years, it has delivered over 400% return. It's fresh from increasing its dividend by 15%, affirming its ability to generate strong cash flows.The stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15, backed with a 0.60% dividend yield. With an average price target of $451, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an 11.69% upside potential from current levels.Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.Suggested articles:20 Most Popular Airlines in the World12 Best Solar Energy and Battery Stocks To Buy NowTop 30 Most Hated Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Shares of rival vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Novavax, which both rely far more on their COVID-19 shots to drive revenue, were down 2.9% and 5.2%, respectively.Sales of the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, which Pfizer shares with German partner BioNTech, fell 83% to $1.49 billion in the second quarter, but came in above analysts' estimates of $1.40 billion.Sales of antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, tumbled 98% to $143 million, compared with estimates of $1.08 billion amid low infection rates globally.The company said its potential cost cuts would be company wide, but mostly focused on its COVID business.Pfizer trimmed the upper end of its 2023 revenue forecast by $1 billion to $70 billion.The New York-based drugmaker is also dealing with tornado damage to a warehouse at its Rocky Mount facility, a narrower-than-expected recommendation for its RSV vaccine from regulators, and concern recently approved cancer drug Talzenna may reach a smaller-than-anticipated patient population.Pfizer, preparing for many top-selling drugs losing patent protection, has responded with acquisitions such as the $43 billion deal for cancer-therapy specialist Seagen to rebuild its product portfolio.Story continuesTotal revenue for the second quarter fell 54% to $12.73 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $13.27 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Excluding items, Pfizer reported a profit of 67 cents per share, topping Wall Street expectations by 10 cents.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Bill Berkrot)]"

225,62ea6ed3-2e5e-347e-8b0a-71410c4d6c0d,IBM,2023-08-01,11 Most Advanced AI Companies,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-advanced-ai-companies-194419641.html,1690832659,STORY,"['AI', 'SNOW', 'ORCL', 'IBM', 'PLTR', 'MSFT', 'PATH', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 most advanced AI companies. To skip our detailed analysis of current trends in the artificial intelligence sector, you can take a look at the 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the markets can talk about these days and for good reason. This form of technology has managed to revolutionize the tech industry in a shockingly short period of time, making every major tech company out there think that the AI space is where they have to be in 2023. Companies across a whole range of fields are quickly making AI investments their top priority, as several surveys conducted this year have shown.AI Investments On The RiseOne such survey is the CNBC Technology Executive Council survey, the results of which were announced on June 23. The survey asked companies about which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months. Options in the answer included AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Of the companies answering the survey, 47.37% said that AI would be their top choice, while 21.05% and 10.53% voted for cloud computing and IoT, respectively. Based on this survey, it can be said that the AI boom will continue to dominate the tech narrative over the foreseeable future just as much as it has been dominating this year. The survey also revealed that 58% of the voting companies saw AI as a critical tech strategy they will be implementing over the next 12 months. Additionally, 53% of the respondents noted that machine learning (ML) will be their critical tech strategy over the same period. Finally, when it comes to AI spending, 63% of the respondents noted that they are accelerating their investments in this technology, 37% of the respondents noted that they are proceeding with caution when it comes to AI spending, and no respondent said that they are not investing in AI.These statistics highlight just how widespread and pervasive the current AI buzz really is. This bodes well for companies massively invested in this space, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). A look at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent disclosure of its AI chatbot Co-Pilot's subscription fees shows just how much these companies are banking on AI today. The subscription fee was announced at $30 per month, and according to CNBC on July 25, the potential market for this product is ""huge."" This is unsurprising considering the fact that ""hundreds of millions"" of Microsoft 365 users are currently making up the potential user base for this new subscription. Additionally, analysts are expected segments like the Azure Cloud business to also help Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefit from the AI boom. This segment has seen slowing growth recently, but in light of the company's active involvement in the AI space, analysts now forecast a growth of 25% for Azure Cloud in the latest quarter.Story continuesThese are just some of the exciting developments brewing in the tech and AI space this year. There's much more to keep an eye on if you are looking to buy into the AI boom in the hopes of benefitting from it in the long run. Considering the vast range of possibilities presented by AI this year, we have compiled a list of some of the most advanced AI companies in the market today. These include the biggest AI companies in the world alongside several emerging AI companies that have been innovating in this space.Most Advanced AI CompaniesPhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyUsing a consensus-based approach by consulting several sources online, we have selected AI companies that have been making innovative moves in the sector this year. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank them.Most Advanced AI Companies11. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company. It is based in Redwood City, California. The company's platform provides an application development and runtime environment enabling customers to design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI applications. Its new product, C3 Generative AI for Enterprise Search, gives enterprise users access to generative AI tech in data management and more.Joe Goodwin, an analyst at JMP Securities, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of July 24. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $38 to $40.There were 24 hedge funds long C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $151.9 million.Here's what Kerrisdale Capital said about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March 2023 investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is a highly innovative AI company.10. Palantir Technologies Inc.

The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $140 to $144.International Business Machines Corporation (NASDAQ:IBM) was seen in the 13F holdings of 49 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $1.5 billion.7. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63Snowflake Inc.

(NYSE:SNOW) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is a dominant player in the Data Warehousing market, offering customers the ability to break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets through Snowflake’s analytical database product, the Data Cloud. The company’s base business is benefitting from a number of secular tailwinds, the three most prevalent being: 1) data-driven decision making, 2) cloud adoption, and 3) the exponential growth of corporate data. The company’s visionary management team, headed by industry veteran Frank Slootman, plans to capture its fair share of this growth through: 1) executing on its land and expand model, 2) acquiring new customers, 3) growing internationally, and 4) expanding its nascent partner network. The stock’s negative contribution in the quarter was due to the timing of Ithaka’s purchase (mid-February) and its small portfolio weighting (100bps).”6. Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67A total of 67 hedge funds held stakes in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.9 billion.An Overweight rating was reiterated on shares of Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) on July 27 by Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc.

The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:Adjusted Net Income Attributable to MPCAdjusted net income attributable to MPC is defined as net income attributable to MPC excluding the items in the table below, along with their related income tax effect. We have excluded these items because we believe that they are not indicative of our core operating performance and that their exclusion results in an important measure of our ongoing financial performance to better assess our underlying business results and trends.Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAdjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income attributable to MPC divided by the number of weighted-average shares outstanding in the applicable period, assuming dilution.Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to MPC to Adjusted Net Income Attributable to MPC (unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,(In millions)2023202220232022Net income attributable to MPC$2,226$5,873$4,950$6,718Pre-tax adjustments:Renewable volume obligation requirements—(238)—(238)Tax impact of adjustments(a)—52—52Adjusted net income attributable to MPC$2,226$5,687$4,950$6,532Diluted income per share$5.32$10.95$11.44$12.15Adjusted diluted income per share$5.32$10.61$11.44$11.81(a) Income taxes for adjusted earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 were calculated by applying a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 22% to the pre-tax adjustments. The corresponding adjustments to reported income taxes are shown in the table above. Adjusted EBITDA Amounts included in net income (loss) attributable to MPC and excluded from adjusted EBITDA include (i) net interest and other financial costs; (ii) provision/benefit for income taxes; (iii) noncontrolling interests; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) refining planned turnaround costs and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary, as shown in the table below. We believe excluding turnaround costs from this metric is useful for comparability to other companies as certain of our competitors defer these costs and amortize them between turnarounds.Adjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to income (loss) from operations, net income attributable to MPC, income before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companiesReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to MPC to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,(In millions)2023202220232022Net income attributable to MPC$2,226$5,873$4,950$6,718Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests354344714671Provision for income taxes5831,7991,4062,081Net interest and other financial costs142312296574Depreciation and amortization8348191,6341,624Refining planned turnaround costs392151749296Renewable volume obligation requirements—(238)—(238)Litigation———(27)Adjusted EBITDA$4,531$9,060$9,749$11,699Refining &amp; Marketing MarginRefining &amp; Marketing margin is defined as sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is used to evaluate our Refining &amp; Marketing segment's operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry's market reference product margins. This measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, Refining &amp; Marketing gross margin or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Reconciliation of Refining &amp; Marketing Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Refining &amp; Marketing Gross Margin and Refining &amp; Marketing Margin (unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,(In millions)2023202220232022Refining &amp; Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA$3,163$7,760$7,016$9,134Plus (Less):Depreciation and amortization(484)(475)(948)(936)Refining planned turnaround costs(392)(151)(749)(296)Selling, general and administrative expenses5965741,1881,082(Income) loss from equity method investments(17)(6)19(18) Net gain on disposal of assets—(37)(3)(37)Other income(241)(234)(292)(415)Refining &amp; Marketing gross margin2,6257,4316,2318,514Plus (Less):Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)2,7482,5545,4934,943Depreciation and amortization484475948936Gross margin excluded from and other income included in Refining &amp; Marketing margin(a)95712885Other taxes included in Refining &amp; Marketing margin(69)(49)(140)(92)Refining &amp; Marketing margin$5,883$10,482$12,560$14,386Refining &amp; Marketing margin by region:Gulf Coast$2,259$4,244$4,910$5,897Mid-Continent2,5354,1355,3795,428West Coast1,0892,1032,2713,061Refining &amp; Marketing margin$5,883$10,482$12,560$14,386(a) Reflects the gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, of other related operations included in the Refining &amp; Marketing segment and processing of credit card transactions on behalf of certain of our marketing customers, net of other income. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marathon-petroleum-corp-reports-second-quarter-2023-results-301890129.htmlSOURCE Marathon Petroleum Corporation]"

After growing both top-line and bottom-line metrics on an underlying basis for the full year in 2022, and again in the first quarter of 2023, the Company continued its trajectory of sustained growth in the second quarter, buoyed by strong performance across its portfolio and across both business units.Story continuesMolson Coors, in the second quarter, grew volume and net sales in its largest markets - U.S., Canada and the U.K. In the U.S., Molson Coors achieved its best quarterly brand volume trend since the MillerCoors Joint Venture in 2008, as Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet each grew volume double-digits. In Canada, both Coors Light and the Molson brand franchise grew volume and net sales in the quarter. Additionally, the U.K. grew volume and net sales in the second quarter backed by triple-digit volume growth from Madri. As of June 30, 2023, Madri was the Company's fourth largest above premium brand by volume in our global portfolio. Furthermore, as of the second quarter, the above premium portfolio accounted for more than half of the net sales generated by brand volumes in our EMEA&amp;APAC segment.Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer Statement:""Our second quarter results represent tremendous growth across our global business, as well as our portfolio. We are proud to report the best quarter of U.S. GAAP reported net sales since the merger of Molson and Coors in 2005, but make no mistake: this is not simply a measure of the three months in the second quarter. These results are a measure of the past three years and a long-term strategy that has made our brands, our supply chain and our breweries demonstrably stronger. Collectively, the investments we have made over the past three years have made us more nimble, more prepared and singularly focused on strengthening our business, attracting consumers, meeting demand and sustaining our results.""Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer Statement:""We are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance, with both business units achieving double-digit net sales and underlying income before income tax growth. We did this while continuing to invest in our business, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. While we remain mindful of the dynamic global macro economic environment and beer industry softness, our robust second quarter performance coupled with the strong foundation we have laid over the last three years, provide us the confidence to significantly raise our 2023 annual guidance. Our strategy is working, positioning us to deliver top and bottom-line growth in 2023 and beyond.""CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE - SECOND QUARTER 2023For the Three Months Ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)June 30, 2023June 30, 2022ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$3,266.6$2,921.711.8%$(9.7)12.1%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$441.1$54.9703.5%$3.7696.7%Underlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$502.2$328.153.1%$1.552.6%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$342.4$47.3623.9%Per diluted share$1.57$0.22613.6%Underlying net income (loss)(1)$387.2$260.148.9%Per diluted share$1.78$1.1949.6%For the Six Months Ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)June 30, 2023June 30, 2022ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$5,612.9$5,136.39.3%$(59.4)10.4%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$543.0$228.6137.5%$10.6132.9%Underlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$660.0$411.660.3%$6.758.7%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$414.9$198.8108.7%Per diluted share$1.91$0.91109.9%Underlying net income (loss)(1)$503.5$323.955.4%Per diluted share$2.31$1.4955.0%(1)Represents income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to MCBC adjusted for non-GAAP items.

Brand volumes improved 5.0% due to an 8.0% increase in the Americas, partially offset by a 2.9% decline in EMEA&amp;APAC.Price and sales mix favorably impacted net sales and net sales per hectoliter by 9.3% and 9.0%, respectively, due to increased net pricing to customers including the rollover benefit of taking several price increases in the previous year, as well as favorable sales mix driven by geographic mix and premiumization.Cost of goods sold (""COGS""): decreased 2.6% on a reported basis, primarily due to lower cost of goods sold per hectoliter and favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by the impact of higher financial volumes. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter: decreased 5.3% primarily due to changes in our unrealized mark-to-market derivative positions of $210.1 million, volume leverage and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by cost inflation related to material and manufacturing expenses and unfavorable mix.

Net sales increased 11.5% in constant currency.Financial volumes increased 5.0% primarily due to an increase in U.S. domestic shipments driven by volume growth in our premium brands, as well as higher shipments in Canada mainly attributed to cycling the prior year impacts of the Québec labor strike. The increase in U.S. volume was impacted by a shift in consumer purchasing behavior largely within the premium segment. Americas brand volumes increased 8.0%, including an 8.7% increase in the U.S. driven by growth in our core brands, with Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet each growing double-digits. Canada brand volumes increased 11.3% mainly driven by cycling the prior year impacts of the Québec labor strike. Latin America volume decreased 5.9% largely due to industry softness in some of our major markets in the region.Price and sales mix favorably impacted net sales and net sales per hectoliter by 6.5% and 6.2%, respectively, primarily due to increased net pricing to customers including the rollover benefit of several price increases taken in the previous year and favorable sales mix.U.S. GAAP and Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: improved 40.0% on a reported U.S. GAAP basis and underlying basis in constant currency primarily due to increased net pricing, higher financial volumes including volume leverage, lower logistics expenses and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation related to material and manufacturing expenses, as well as higher MG&amp;A expense. Higher MG&amp;A spend was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing investment on innovation brands.EMEA&amp;APAC SegmentNet sales: The following table highlights the drivers of the change in net sales and net sales per hectoliter for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022 (in percentages):For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023FinancialVolumePrice andSales MixCurrencyNet SalesEMEA&amp;APAC - Net sales(3.0)%17.7%1.6%16.3%EMEA&amp;APAC - Net sales per hectoliterN/A18.3%1.6%19.9%Net sales increased 16.3% driven by favorable price and sales mix as well as by favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by a decline in financial volumes. Net sales increased 14.7% in constant currency.Financial volumes decreased 3.0% and brand volumes declined 2.9% primarily due to declines in Central and Eastern Europe due to industry softness including the inflationary pressures on the consumer, partially offset by resilient demand and growth in above premium volumes in the U.K.Price and sales mix favorably impacted net sales and net sales per hectoliter by 17.7% and 18.3%, respectively, primarily due to increased net pricing to customers including the rollover benefits from price increases taken in the previous year and favorable sales mix driven by premiumization and geographic mix.U.S. GAAP and Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: U.S. GAAP income before income taxes improved 86.6% on a reported basis and underlying income before income taxes improved 82.7% in constant currency, primarily due to increased net pricing to customers and favorable sales mix, partially offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation on materials, logistics and manufacturing expenses.CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY HIGHLIGHTSU.S. GAAP cash from operations: net cash provided by operating activities was $894.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 which improved $227.6 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net income, lower interest paid, as well as the favorable timing of working capital in the Americas, partially offset by higher income taxes paid.Underlying free cash flow: cash received of $569.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 which represents an increase of $282.5 million from the prior year, was primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities and lower capital expenditures as a result of the timing of capital projects.Debt: Total debt as of June 30, 2023 was $6,615.1 million and cash and cash equivalents totaled $960.9 million, resulting in net debt of $5,654.2 million and a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 2.50x. As of June 30, 2022, our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio was 3.20x.Dividends: A cash dividend of $0.41 per share was declared and paid to eligible shareholders of record on the respective record dates during the six months ended June 30, 2023, for a total of $0.82 per share or a CAD equivalent of CAD 1.10 per share.

We recognized $0.4 million discrete tax expense in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $2.3 million discrete tax benefit in the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, there was a disproportionate impact from the discrete tax benefit on our effective tax rate due to lower income before income taxes.2023 OUTLOOKWe are raising our 2023 key financial guidance metrics to reflect the continued strength we are seeing in our core brands in the U.S. while remaining mindful of the softness in the beer industry and continued caution around the consumer.Net sales: high single-digit increase versus 2022 on a constant currency basis from our previous guidance of a low single-digit increase.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: 23%-26% increase compared to 2022 on a constant currency basis from our previous guidance of a low single-digit increase.Underlying free cash flow: $1.2 billion, plus or minus 10% from our previous guidance of $1.0 billion, plus or minus 10%.Consolidated net interest expense: $225 million, plus or minus 5% from our previous guidance of $240 million, plus or minus 5%.We continue to expect the following targets for full year 2023.Capital Expenditures: $700 million incurred, plus or minus 5%Underlying depreciation and amortization: $690 million, plus or minus 5%.Underlying effective tax rate: in the range of 21% to 23% for 2023.On July 13, 2023 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on its Class A and Class B common shares of $0.41 per share, payable September 15, 2023, to shareholders of record on September 1, 2023.

Financial volume in hectoliters for Americas and EMEA&amp;APAC excludes royalty volume of 1.263 million hectoliters and 0.406 million hectoliters, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and excludes royalty volume of 1.246 million hectoliters and 0.537 million hectoliters, respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2022.WORLDWIDE BRAND AND FINANCIAL VOLUME(In millions of hectoliters) (Unaudited)For the Three Months EndedJune 30, 2023June 30, 2022ChangeFinancial Volume23.38522.7392.8%Contract brewing and wholesale/factored volume(1.952)(1.858)5.1%Royalty volume0.8950.8633.7%Sales-To-Wholesaler to Sales-To-Retail adjustment0.494(0.004)N/MTotal Worldwide Brand Volume22.82221.7405.0%N/M = Not meaningfulWorldwide brand volume (or ""brand volume"" when discussed by segment) reflects owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), royalty volume and our proportionate share of equity investment worldwide brand volume calculated consistently with MCBC owned volume. Financial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographical markets, net of returns and allowances as well as contract brewing, wholesale non-owned brand volume and company-owned distribution volume. Contract brewing and wholesale/factored volume is included within financial volume, but is removed from worldwide brand volume, as this is non-owned volume for which we do not directly control performance. Factored volume in our EMEA&amp;APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, which is a common arrangement in the U.K. Royalty volume consists of our brands produced and sold by third parties under various license and contract-brewing agreements and because this is owned volume, it is included in worldwide brand volume. Our worldwide brand volume definition also includes an adjustment from Sales-to-Wholesaler (""STW"") volume to Sales-to-Retailer (""STR"") volume. We believe the brand volume metric is important because, unlike financial volume and STWs, it provides the closest indication of the performance of our brands in relation to market and competitor sales trends.We also utilize net sales per hectoliter and cost of goods sold per hectoliter, as well as the year over year changes in such metrics, as key metrics for analyzing our results. These metrics are calculated as net sales and cost of goods sold, respectively, per our consolidated statement of operations divided by financial volume for the respective period. We believe these metrics are important and useful for investors and management because it provides an indication of the trends in pricing and sales mix on our net sales and the trends of sales mix and other cost impacts such as inflation on our cost of goods sold.USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURESIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), we also use non-GAAP financial measures, as listed and defined below, for operational and financial decision making and to assess Company and segment business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. We have provided reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure.Our management uses these metrics to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. We believe these measures are used by, and are useful to, investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance.Underlying Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Closest GAAP Metric: Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s income (loss) before income taxes excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. Non-GAAP adjustment items include goodwill and other intangible and tangible asset impairments, restructuring and integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, potential or incurred losses related to certain litigation accruals and settlements and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, among other items included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective, involve significant management judgment and can vary substantially from company to company.Underlying COGS (Closest GAAP Metric: COGS) – Measure of the Company’s COGS adjusted to exclude non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). Non-GAAP adjustment items include the impact of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on our commodity derivative instruments, which are economic hedges, and are recorded through COGS within Unallocated. As the exposure we are managing is realized, we reclassify the gain or loss to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides, allowing our segments to realize the economic effects of the derivatives without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility.Underlying MG&amp;A (Closest GAAP Metric: MG&amp;A) – Measure of the Company’s MG&amp;A expense excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above).Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC) – Measure of net income (loss) attributable to MCBC excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above), the related tax effects of non-GAAP adjustment items and certain other discrete tax items.Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share) – Measure of underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (as defined above) per diluted share. If applicable, a reported net loss attributable to MCBC per diluted share is calculated using the basic share count due to dilutive shares being antidilutive. If underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC becomes income excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustment items, we include the incremental dilutive shares, using the treasury stock method, into the dilutive shares outstanding.Underlying effective tax rate (Closest GAAP Metric: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of the Company’s effective tax rate excluding the related tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above) and certain other discrete tax items. Discrete tax items include certain significant tax audit and prior year reserve adjustments, impact of significant tax legislation and tax rate changes and significant non-recurring and period specific tax items.Underlying free cash flow (Closest GAAP Metric: Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities) – Measure of the Company’s operating cash flow calculated as Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities less Additions to Properties and excluding the pre-tax cash flow impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). We consider underlying free cash flow an important measure of our ability to generate cash, grow our business and enhance shareholder value, driven by core operations and after adjusting for non-GAAP adjustment items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure.Underlying depreciation and amortization (Closest GAAP Metric: Depreciation &amp; Amortization) – Measure of the Company’s depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). These adjustments primarily consist of accelerated depreciation or amortization taken related to the Company’s strategic exit or restructuring activities.Net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""underlying EBITDA"") (Closest GAAP Metrics: Cash, Debt, &amp; Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s leverage calculated as Net debt (defined as current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the trailing twelve month underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBITDA is calculated as Net Income (Loss) excluding Interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). This measure is not the same as the Company’s maximum leverage ratio as defined under its revolving credit facility, which allows for other adjustments in the calculation of net debt to EBITDA.Constant currency - Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized to measure performance, excluding the impact of translational and certain transactional foreign currency movements, and is intended to be indicative of results in local currency. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. We present all percentage changes for net sales, underlying COGS, underlying MG&amp;A and underlying income (loss) before income taxes in constant currency and calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current period results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior year period. Additionally, we exclude any transactional foreign currency impacts, reported within the other non-operating income (expense), net line item, from our current period results.Our guidance for any of the measures noted above are also non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. When we provide guidance for any of the various non-GAAP metrics described above, we do not provide reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures as we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of the non-GAAP adjustment items. By their very nature, non-GAAP adjustment items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable efforts.RECONCILIATION TO NEAREST U.S. GAAP MEASURESReconciliation by Line Item(In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Cost of goodssoldMarketing,general andadministrativeexpensesIncome (loss)before incometaxesNet income(loss)attributable toMCBCNet income(loss)attributable toMCBC perdiluted shareReported (U.S. GAAP)$(2,047.7)$(734.9)$441.1$342.4$1.57Adjustments to arrive at underlyingRestructuring——(0.2)(0.2)—Unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses62.7—60.860.80.28Other items—0.70.50.5—Total$62.7$0.7$61.1$61.1$0.28Tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments———(15.5)(0.07)Discrete tax items———(0.8)—Underlying (Non-GAAP)$(1,985.0)$(734.2)$502.2$387.2$1.78(In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023Cost of goodssoldMarketing,general andadministrativeexpensesIncome (loss)before incometaxesNet income(loss)attributable toMCBCNet income(loss)attributable toMCBC perdiluted shareReported (U.S. GAAP)$(3,623.3)$(1,349.9)$543.0$414.9$1.91Adjustments to arrive at underlyingRestructuring——0.30.3—Unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses114.5—112.6112.60.52Other items—4.34.14.10.02Total$114.5$4.3$117.0$117.0$0.54Tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments———(27.6)(0.13)Discrete tax Items———(0.8)—Underlying (Non-GAAP)$(3,508.8)$(1,345.6)$660.0$503.5$2.31Reconciliation to Underlying Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes by Segment(In millions) (Unaudited)For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023AmericasEMEA&amp;APACUnallocatedConsolidatedIncome (loss) before income taxes$487.3$64.2$(110.4)$441.1Add/Less:Cost of goods sold(1)——62.762.7Marketing, general &amp; administrative0.50.2—0.7Other non-GAAP adjustment items(0.2)(0.2)(1.9)(2.3)Total non-GAAP adjustment items$0.3$—$60.8$61.1Underlying income (loss) before income taxes$487.6$64.2$(49.6)$502.2(In millions) (Unaudited)For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023AmericasEMEA&amp;APACUnallocatedConsolidatedIncome (loss) before income taxes$720.7$38.8$(216.5)$543.0Add/(less):Cost of goods sold(1)——114.5114.5Marketing, general &amp; administrative1.03.3—4.3Other non-GAAP adjustment items(0.2)0.3(1.9)(1.8)Total non-GAAP adjustment items$0.8$3.6$112.6$117.0Underlying income (loss) before income taxes$721.5$42.4$(103.9)$660.0(1)Reflects changes in our mark-to-market positions on our commodity hedges recorded as cost of goods sold within Unallocated.

Molson may be able to quench investors' thirst for stocks with more upside as earnings estimates are noticeably higher.Strong quarterly growth is expected for the global beer manufacturer with popular brands including Blue Moon, Miller Life, Coors Light, and Miller Genuine Draft. Molson’s second-quarter earnings are expected to soar 33% to $1.59 per share compared to $1.19 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, Q2 sales are forecasted to be up 12% to $3.29 billion.Even better, annual earnings are now projected to jump 16% this year and rise another 2% in fiscal 2024 at $4.86 per share. Earnings estimates have continued to trend higher over the last quarter and the cherry on top may be Molson’s 2.32% dividend yield in a space where many stocks don’t offer a payout to shareholders.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMarriott International (MAR)Higher travel demand has continued to boost hotel chain operators and Marriott International's stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The hospitality leaders' Q2 earnings are expected to climb 21% YoY to $2.19 per share. Sales for the quarter are anticipated at $6.05 billion, up 13% from a year ago.Annual earnings are now expected to soar 26% this year and rise another 8% in FY24 at $9.14 per share. Earnings estimates have remained higher and Marriott has a modest 1.05% dividend yield to further compel its strengthening outlook.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchElectronic Arts (EA)   Lastly, Electronic Arts stock is appealing heading into its fiscal first-quarter earnings report tomorrow and sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The leading interactive entertainment and gaming company is expecting stellar quarterly growth.Story continuesTo that point, Electronic Arts’ Q1 earnings are expected to skyrocket 215% to $1.01 per share compared to EPS of $0.32 a year ago. First-quarter sales are projected to climb 22% YoY to $1.59 billion.Regaining the mojo it received from higher gaming during the pandemic, Electronic Arts’ annual earnings are anticipated to climb 25% in its current FY24 and rise another 10% in FY25 at $7.54 per share. Earnings estimates are modestly higher and Electronic Arts offers a 0.55% dividend yield in an industry that is focused on growth and rarely offers a payout.   Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThese consumer-centric companies are expected to have posted strong quarterly growth and now may be a good time to buy their stocks for a strengthening outlook. Plus, Molson Coors, Marriott International, and Electronic Arts are leaders in their respective industries and should remain viable investments for 2023 and beyond.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The leading alcohol beverage company is likely to register year-over-year revenue growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AB InBev’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $15.4 billion, suggesting 3.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. For second-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 68 cents per share, suggesting a 9.3% decline from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus estimate has moved down by a couple of cents in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.6%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV Price and EPS SurpriseAnheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV price-eps-surprise | Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV QuoteKey Factors to NoteAB InBev’s top line has been reflecting continued business momentum due to relentless execution, investment in its brands and accelerated digital transformation. The company has been benefiting from its unique commercial strategy, a strong brand portfolio and investments in operation excellence. These have been aiding market share growth across most key markets. Continued resilience in the global beer category is also expected to have aided the second-quarter performance.BUD has been steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including ready-to-drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has recently been gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. The company has been focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.AB InBev is anticipated to have benefited from continued premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends in the second quarter. The company has been investing in a diverse portfolio of global, international, and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, BUD’s global brands lead the way in premiumization. These factors are likely to have boosted the company’s top line in the second quarter.The rapid expansion of its digital platform and leveraging technology, such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms, have been the key drivers for BUD. The company has been witnessing an acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, aiding growth for the past few months. These are expected to have contributed significantly to the top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.BUD’s revenue-management initiatives and premiumization efforts are likely to have aided revenues per hl in the second quarter. Growth in the premium portfolio and the expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio are expected to have driven volume gains in the to-be-reported quarter.However, AB InBev’s bottom line is expected to have been marred by adverse currency translations, commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets. Higher commodity costs have been mainly resulting from increased aluminum and barley prices. BUD’s presence across various countries exposes it to negative currency translations.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected higher commodity costs to keep exerting pressure on input costs. The company also anticipated volatile foreign currency.Higher costs of sales and SG&amp;A expenses are likely to have weighed on the company’s gross and operating margins. Elevated supply-chain costs have been primarily driving higher SG&amp;A expenses for the past few quarters.Our model predicts the cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, to expand 20 bps year over year to 46.1% in the second quarter. A higher cost of products sold rate due to elevated input costs is likely to have led to a soft gross margin in the quarter. We estimate the gross margin to contract 20 bps to 53.9% in the to-be-reported quarter. We anticipate normalized EBIT to decline 80 bps to 25% in the second quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for AB InBev this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has moved up by a penny in the past seven days to $1.19 per share. The consensus mark indicates growth of 28% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.The consumer and professional products company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.47%, on average. CLX delivered an earnings surprise of 25.83% in the last reported quarter.The Clorox Company Price and EPS Surprise The Clorox Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Clorox Company price-eps-surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteFactors to NoteClorox has been gaining from solid demand for its products and brands, digital investments, pricing actions, and focus on cost management. Its IGNITE strategy and digital investments also bode well. This is likely to have aided the top and bottom lines in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023.Strength in the Health and Wellness, Household and Lifestyle businesses, supported by solid demand for its products, is likely to have aided the company’s top and bottom-line performances in the fiscal fourth quarter. It has been witnessing continued strength in the core International business, as it has been building on the success of the segment's Go Lean strategy.Driven by CLX’s IGNITE strategy, which aims to improve profitability in the International business, it has been investing selectively in profitable platforms. These efforts are expected to have accelerated profitable growth for the segment in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect revenues for the company’s Health and Wellness segment to increase 3% year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, whereas the Household and Lifestyle businesses are predicted to deliver sales growth of 2% each. Our model predicted sales for the International business to improve 1% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.Additionally, Clorox has been taking a proactive approach to addressing persistent cost inflation. By implementing a combination of pricing and cost-saving efforts, the company aims to mitigate the impacts of rising costs and maintain its profitability. This should aid its margins in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect the gross margin to expand 190 bps in the fiscal fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected Clorox’s net sales to increase 1-2% for fiscal 2023, whereas organic sales were projected to grow 3-4%. The gross margin was anticipated to expand 250-300 basis points due to pricing, cost-saving and supply-chain-optimization efforts, offsetting cost inflation.Selling and administrative expenses are estimated to be 16% of net sales, including investments in digital capabilities. Adjusted EPS is anticipated to increase 6-10% to $4.35-$4.50 for fiscal 2023.However, Clorox has been witnessing the adverse impacts of inflation, and higher manufacturing, logistics and commodity costs. For fiscal 2023, management expected cost inflation of $400 million, including commodities, transportation and wage inflation. It also anticipates broad-based inflation across the entire supply chain. These factors are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.Moreover, the company has been witnessing rising costs due to investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, CLX expected selling and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 to include 1.5 percentage points of impact from its strategic investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. The company anticipates advertising and sales promotion spending to be 10% of sales for fiscal 2023, induced by its commitment to investing in its brand portfolio.Our model estimates selling and administrative expenses to increase 26.9% year over year in the fourth quarter, while selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, are likely to expand 330 bps year over year.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Clorox this time around.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the automotive industry, head directly to 5 Best Small Cap Automotive Stocks To Buy. In 2023, the automotive industry will remain susceptible to hindrances due to global headwinds. These challenges include the energy crisis, lower automotive demand worldwide, and continuing supply-chain problems. In 2023, new-vehicle sales are projected to remain flat, particularly in Europe and the US. According to the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), global new car sales are expected to increase by just 0.9%, hindered by reduced consumer spending, high commodity prices, and supply-chain disruptions causing production delays. Sales in western Europe are predicted to fall by about 3%, while in North America, they are expected to drop by 2.4%. Additionally, new commercial vehicle sales will also decline globally by 1.3% due to a forecasted recession in the Eurozone and slower GDP growth in the US and China. Overall, new-vehicle sales are anticipated to see marginal growth in 2023, mainly driven by growth in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Despite this, the total global new-vehicle sales of 79 million units in 2023 are expected to lag behind the pre-pandemic levels of 88 million units.Don't Miss: 10 Best Auto and Truck Dealership Stocks to BuyAt the end of March 2023, Affinitiv pointed out that the challenges plaguing the automotive industry go beyond just chip shortages, concerns about EV legislation, and technological collaborations. The firm mentioned seven trends to watch in 2023 which would shape the future of the auto industry. Firstly, Affinitiv cited recent studies which show that around 55% of buyers prioritize excellent customer experience over competitive prices when choosing a dealership. Additionally, 75% of customers would increase their dealership visits if the purchasing process were more convenient, while 60% would make quicker purchasing decisions if the process were made more accessible. Secondly, to combat supply chain challenges, it will be beneficial for manufacturers to shift from just-in-time to just-in-case inventory systems in order to boost supplies, even if it means incurring higher inventory costs. Story continuesMoreover, to cater to younger audiences, auto manufacturers are expected to integrate voice-activated services, biometric controls, digital cockpits, and 5G capabilities in their vehicles. The shift to EVs is also imperative in the future. Furthermore, Affinitiv observed that approximately 30% of consumers are comfortable buying online, and most car buyers expect dealers to provide permanent online options. However, some buyers are unhappy with initial online experiences due to dealers struggling with low inventory and extended waiting times after pre-orders. To address this, dealers must simplify negotiating and buying processes to prevent potential delays. Affinitiv also noted that about 75% of auto consumers are influenced by online videos when making a purchase decision. Innovative formats like 360-degree videos can sway 65% of consumers to buy a car without a test drive. Therefore, auto manufacturers should display video walkarounds on dealership websites offering potential buyers information equivalent to an in-person viewing experience.

To skip our detailed analysis of the trends and dynamics of women's businesses, head directly to see the 5 Richest Women in the World.Women’s WealthA lot of the richest people in the world have had to lose their wealth in 2022. According to Forbes World’s Richest List 2023, the total number of billionaires dropped from 2,668 in 2022 to 2,640 in 2023. Overall, the world’s billionaires have lost $500 billion of net worth from $12.7 trillion in March 2022 to $12.2 trillion in March 2023. An interesting fact to note is that the number of female billionaires is on the rise. Among the top richest people in the world, there are 337 women billionaires, up from 327 in 2022. Women have started to step up and take the initiative of starting their businesses. As we mentioned earlier, almost half of all women-owned businesses are from three sectors that include healthcare and social assistance, beauty and pet care, and scientific and technical services. Women-owned businesses in the U.S. have performed significantly well. First Round Capital claims that the companies it invested in with female founders outperformed all-male founding companies by 63%. Additionally, as we discussed previously, Kauffman Fellows found women-led teams produced 35% better return on investment compared to all-male teams.Women Kept Under Shadows for YearsWomen have faced gender discrimination for centuries in politics, in the workplace, and at home. In some countries, women are legally restricted to work in certain professions while in other economies, they are discriminated against by pay gaps. These are a few problems that have kept women under the shadow for many years. Developed economies have made major changes in their laws and frameworks to implement gender equality across all phases of life. Feminists have been vocal about the interests of women in all fields of life. According to Pacific University, in 1848 the first wave of modern feminism took place at the Seneca Falls Convention. Elizabeth Cady Stanton introduced and drafted the Seneca Falls Declaration highlighting the ideology and political aspects of the movement. The second movement in the 1960s focused on social equality with equal rights regardless of sex. The movement continued once again in the 1990s, proving the point that women can play an equal and as important role as men. Story continuesTechnology Paving Ways for WomenOne of the major things that have played a big role in women’s equality is technology. Modern technology has created awareness across the globe and women have explored their potential in the best way possible. For instance, women entrepreneurs have made the best use of e-commerce. The e-commerce marketplace has allowed women to capitalize in one of the largest markets in the world. The biggest e-commerce company, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), has around 9.7 million sellers worldwide, and 1.9 million are active on the platform. On June 19, SellerApp shared the Amazon.com seller statistics showing that women account for 33% of the retailer's sellers, which is a sublime development for women entrepreneurs.Companies Led by Female CEOsWe have entered a new era as more than 10% of women now lead Fortune 500 companies. The Fortune 500 ranks the largest U.S. public companies by revenue. These companies accumulate around $18 trillion in revenue, representing more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP. For many decades, the big companies were dominated by male executives. Now we have 53 female CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, which enlightens gender diversity in executive leadership to another level. Women now have a more important role to play as executives, making massive decisions at the top level.Some of the Fortune 500 companies which are led by female CEOs include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS), General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV). These five Fortune 500 companies are led by CEOs Lisa Su, Karen Lynch, Mary Barra, Rosalind Brewer, and Gail Koziara Boudreaux, respectively. The female CEOs are putting in a great effort to take these companies to new heights. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the largest companies on the Fortune 500 list. On June 14, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled its next-generation chip called MI-300 at its product reveal event, which is being considered a potential alternative to NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s AI chips. The company is using AI to be its next big tool for GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions. The CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Lisa Su, during the launch event, highlighted AI as ""AMD's largest and most strategic long term growth opportunity."" Shortly after the event, Lisa Su, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the development of their new AI chip, M1-300. AMD has entered into a new phase of chipmaking with the announcement of its newest generation chip. Su added that everyone is talking about Chatgpt and large language models, and MI-300 is designed for these use cases. Here are some of the comments from Su:""AI is the defining megatrend for the technology right now. Like, everybody is talking about AI, we have been working on this roadmap for many many years. MI-300 is our newest generation chip and frankly, it’s incredible and I mean, the amount of technology we have on this, a 153 billion transistors. Our customers are super excited about this and we are working closely with them. We will sample in the third quarter and will be in production by the end of the year. What we see is there is a tremendous demand for GPUs in AI space, for both training and inference. We work with all of the largest cloud manufacturers and many of the largest enterprise guys. So, the key is to get these products to market as fast as possible. It is an incredible time for technology. AI has kinda changed the way we perceive what we’re doing in every industry and every market for all of our productivity and business applications. We have developed a really comprehensive software capability that is optimized for hardware. We call that the ROCm ecosystem, but on top of that we’ve all these folks in the market that are really developing these frameworks, and the purpose of these frameworks is actually to make it fairly easy and transparent to move different hardware ecosystems.""According to Su, the total addressable market for AI GPUs is around $30 billion right now and it is going to grow more than 50% each year over the next three to four years. ""We see like $150 billion by the time we get to 2027,"" added Su.25 Richest Women in the WorldRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo find the list of the 25 richest women in the world, we took the data from Forbes’ Real-time Billionaire List.

A new report from Bloomberg shows that purchases made directly through the major U.S. airlines fell in the second quarter. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the report and explains why consumers may be starting to pull back.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: We're going to take a look at some of the trending stories of the day. Josh Schafer is here to help us break it all down. And guys, first up, let's talk about the travel boom or maybe lack thereof pretty soon, because it might be signs that it could be fading here. There's new data compiled by Bloomberg and taking a look at flights booked directly through airlines. And they found an interesting trend. And that's the fact that that number declined in the second quarter for eight of the 10 domestic, largest domestic airlines here.So you got to ask yourself whether or not inflation is starting to catch up with consumers, when it comes-- obviously has a lot of ways-- when it comes to spending on travel, an area that we haven't necessarily seen any weakness in yet, at least for the airlines.JOSH SCHAFER: And the other interesting thing I saw in that article, Diane, was that they were pointing out that Alaska Airlines actually said that prices came down, right? So when you think about even just-- even if demand does come down right and people have less money to spend, also if these airlines are charging less money for the flights, you would need more people to go on the flights. So I think that's kind of an interesting dynamic at play, too, when you think about pricing power and just flight prices being a little bit cheaper.Does that mean that all of a sudden we're going to start taking two flights again? I don't know. We're so used to these flights being expensive, right?DIANE KING HALL: I mean, but it also, you wonder if it's a tale of two airlines. I mean, you had Delta Airlines doing great. I mean, they hiked their forecast. Delta and United both doing well, though. United had some snafus recently. And it's certainly not helpful to the airlines when you have all the travel problems and the mess at the airport. I experienced that this weekend myself due to weather, of course, so they can kind of blame it away. And that certainly doesn't kind of help the travel picture.Story continuesI do-- I did feel like just-- I mean, this is anecdotally that demand was still holding up right now. But again, we're talking about summer bookings, which are basically done.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And it's very important to point out that this data actually tracks when they are booked rather than-- so right now, rather than the airlines who actually obviously don't really take it into account until the actual flight until you go on the flight, until that revenue is actually produced. But prices, they're still above where we were in 2019. So they're down on a year-over-year basis. But 2022, the flights-- the prices that we were looking at a year ago was astronomical and not much improvement.But I think right now, when people are feeling so pressured in almost every aspect of their life, if you've already gone on a few trips since COVID, maybe that pent-up demand story that we've been talking about for so long, that's going to fade. And I think this is the question and this was-- we were struggling really to try to put the timeline on this of when we would actually see some impact when it comes to the travel names. And at least when you look at this index, and it doesn't include booking sites, it doesn't include corporate sales, we are starting to see some of that weakness.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, and we haven't even talked about business travel, right, when we're talking about flights overall and airlines overall.DIANE KING HALL: --leisure travel.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. And that's something that Southwest flagged last week, right? Bob Jordan saying that basically, they're not seeing business travel come back all the way to the extent that they thought they were going to. And they're not sure when it's going to come back. So then you think about that with maybe the general consumer demand that was maybe even a little bit higher than normal coming down. And you have a tough-- that's a tough balance.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. The business travel will come back. But will it be enough to compensate for the reduction in consumer? Because revenge spending won't last forever.SEANA SMITH: I question if business travel is really going to come back across the board.DIANE KING HALL: You don't think so? I think it will.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. You would have thought, at this point, maybe it would have. But some airlines are saying that they're very confident that we are going to get there if they haven't reached there yet. I'm still a bit skeptical. But we'll see.]"
247,5e636a76-9a02-31fc-a5a0-29fa1d05c73d,UAL,2023-08-01,More Americans are traveling internationally: Which airlines stand to benefit,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/more-americans-traveling-internationally-airlines-152856270.html,1690817336,VIDEO,"['JBLU', 'LUV', 'UAL', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[Based on airlines' earnings, it's clear that Americans still want to travel. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker tells Yahoo Finance Live that demand has begun to shift from domestic to international travel. Becker ""American (Airlines), Delta, and United have done really well this year"" because they have the most exposure to international travel.Video Transcript- Let's get to airlines in particular and the numbers that they've been reporting and have yet to report. It's been a mixed picture for the industry this year despite raised forecasts from the likes of Delta and American Airlines and soaring earnings as travel demand remains strong. There are still cost concerns and looming pilot shortages still lingering.For more on the state of the industry, we're joined by Helane Becker, TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst. Helane, it's always good to see you. We've heard from most of them. We still have JetBlue to report tomorrow. But kind of give us a state of play of where we are given what we've heard so far.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. I think-- thanks for the question. I think what we're seeing in terms of demand is still very, very strong demand but pricing has come off their peaks. And I guess it was just not sustainable that ticket prices would stay as robust as they were, number one. And number two, I think you're seeing a shift as well. We've talked about demand being strong domestically for 2021 and 2022 and then shifting internationally for '23 and '24.And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing very strong North Atlantic demand and Europe. And I'm going to say air quotes around everybody seems to be in Italy this summer. And then next summer we think we'll see strong demand on the Trans-pacific for all markets except for probably China.- And so Helane, with that kind of international travel focus that you were just alluding to a moment ago, who are the biggest beneficiaries from your coverage and perspective?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, exactly. That's why American, Delta, and United have done really well this year because they have the most exposure. And United specifically is more exposed to international markets than any of the other airlines. JetBlue has a couple of flights, one to Paris one to London. And I think they're adding Amsterdam next month. And that's it. Some of the other smaller US airlines, like Frontier and Spirit fly near US markets. So they'll do Caribbean, Mexico, Northern South America.Story continuesBut that's that demand was part of last year's strength. This year's strength is really on the North Atlantic and most airlines, with the exception actually of United, got rid of all their widebody or a lot of their widebody aircraft during the pandemic. And now with the demand shifting, they're having a hard time keeping up because they don't have the aircraft to put into service. And that's why you've seen American and Delta come out with some aircraft orders. And B, the other thing that we've seen in terms of demand for aircraft a shift to least in aircraft or buying aircraft off from the Lessor's primarily because the OEMs are still lagging on deliveries.- Even with the strong demand environment, it seems like some of the travel headaches are still looming large. You ask passengers just-- and I mean, you're nodding in concert with perhaps a lot of the emotions and feelings of some of our viewers right now. How does that kind of add on a knock on effect to some of the airlines right now that are either bringing capacity, continuing to bring that back online, or have code sharing agreements where they're sending passengers through some of the rigmarole of just how if they miss their flights where they need to rebook, who gets the credit, so forth. What type of knock on the stock does that eventually create, if any?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, no, that's a really great question. So I mean, it's just so frustrating for passengers. You plan all year long for your vacation, you're looking forward to it, and then something goes wrong the day that you travel. And it's not always the fault of the airlines. Sometimes it's weather that creeps in, especially summer storms. Those are so unpredictable versus, we've talked about this before, Brad you and I, the winter storms are almost always predictable. You know when you're going to get a big snowstorm. But with summer pop up thunderstorms, you don't.And then there are downstream delays, to your point. And then passengers get frustrated. And I think the eventual effect will be, well, we sort of did that. I'm tired of all my flights being delayed or many flights being delayed. I'm just not going to take a trip that month or that week. I'm going to try to find a day of the week, like Tuesday, Wednesday, that might be less busy. And that does definitely impact results at some point. It's just right now everybody, again, those air quotes, wants to travel.And until schools start to resume and in some cases, especially Southern tier of the US, they'll start to resume next week and the week after, you'll still see strong travel out of the Northeast. And we don't-- that's not going to stop because those bookings are already made. But we've seen airports start to hire more people in an effort to help during the busiest times. And yeah, it just gets really frustrating. I get it.And I always say to people, welcome to my life. I feel like for every [AUDIO OUT] that's on time or early, I'm going to pay for it with a later canceled flight at some point in my future.- Well, it's funny, Helane, because as the airlines try to manage through it-- just as an example, my son was flying this weekend. We got a message from the airline the night before, you might want to think about pushing your trip because there are thunderstorms forecast for the next day. Guess what, no thunderstorms. Totally clear. The flight left on time. So I'd be pretty upset if I changed my flight with the anticipation that the--So it really does seem like a no win situation but it also seems like a situation that technology and more staffing could at least help. So that implies that the airlines are going to have to spend more to address this, especially if the demand remains even close to the fever pitch where it's been.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. And the demand that we're seeing also is pretty equal to what we saw in 2019 but the mix is different. It's more leisure and it's less business. And I think one difference is that people who are infrequent travelers get more stressed out than people who are frequent travelers and know that this type of thing happens is, quote unquote, ""all the time.""But the other thing, to your point, one of the things that technology could do for the airlines is an enable connecting passengers to change the connecting hub. So if you're coming from mid-con and let's say you're coming out of Saint Louis and you're going to London and your first choice was to connect over New York, if New York is going to have thunderstorms, maybe Boston doesn't or Chicago doesn't. Maybe those storms have passed through.From the airline's perspective, they should be able to reroute you over a different hub and their technology should enable either you to do that on their website or your iPhone or your smart device, or they can do it for you so that you don't miss a day of your vacation because, to your point, just because there are forecast thunderstorms in my town, there may not be in yours. So we can-- they should be able to, with technology, make those adjustments.And that's something that I find interesting because the industry was an early adopter of technology and using computers to issue boarding passes and check bags, and so on. And then through the bankruptcies that they all experienced in the last or two decades ago and they lagged on updating their technology. And I think they're starting to think about catching up now.- Helane, just while we have you, we asked the CFO of Chipotle last week-- and follow me on this one. We asked the CFO of Chipotle last week how global warming could impact how they think about their business. And that was with regard to kind of sourcing the necessary menu items.For airlines and the travel experience, I mean, you just talked about storms and more severe weather that they have to account for and communicate that to their passengers. And their passengers may eventually shift some of the travel schedules around unknown parts of the year where there could be extreme weather that derails their trip plans. Is there a broader kind of concern or at least a thought or evaluation that these companies are starting to give around global warming and how that changes what the customer propensity is to travel at certain times of the year?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. That's a really great question because it's something that we've been looking at for the last year or so. And it's slightly different-- well, in two different ways. One, exactly what you're saying. Markets like Seattle for an example that historically wouldn't have snow, it would have rain, but it wouldn't be so overwhelming rain that it would shut the airport down for an extended period of time. And yet last winter, you saw Seattle experience snow and ice.So you're definitely seeing that weather pattern shift that's causing airports that haven't had to deal with de-icing or runway clearing to have to start thinking about their investments in de-icing pads, de-icing fluid, and so on. So that's definitely one thing that we are paying attention to and I think the airlines and the airports are starting to think about. We're seeing that at various conferences that's being added as a discussion item. So yes to that part.And then the other part that I would say is with respect to sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has some commitment with a producer of SAF to provide that to them over the next, say, decade because a lot of those orders go out that far. And the government through the Inflation Reduction Act is incentivizing manufacturers, the energy manufacturers, to produce more SAF.And that's really the problem. Airlines are only 2% of emissions but the longest flights are 80% of the total emissions. So it's not really a-- like road transport is still the number one emissions. But that said, airlines are an easy target and we need more sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has said, we're there to buy it if you make it. And you just have to do it in a cost effective manner.The industry worldwide, Brad, to give you an idea of the numbers, uses 100 billion gallons of jet fuel annually. And the amount of sustainable aviation fuel that's out there right now is less than 5%. I don't even think it's 1%. So it's not even-- like it's in the ballpark of what's needed. And that's a 20-- I say that's a 2025 to 2040 development. That's where you're going to see the industry go over the next 15 years.- Helane, always a fascinating conversation. Thanks so much for taking the time to really break down what you're tracking over at TD Cowen. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker joining us this morning. Thanks so much.]"

The article explores three leading banks’ impressive financial performance, strategic investments and forward-looking approaches.The first global banking giant stock has grown remarkably across various geographies and businesses. Its balanced growth strategy and diverse presence in thriving markets have paved the way for continued success and rewarded shareholders. Moreover, the recent acquisition of new avenues for future growth has helped, especially in the technology and life sciences sectors.While the second one has proven its resilience and strength despite facing industry challenges, this entity is well-prepared to navigate the uncertainties of the banking sector while delivering solid returns to its shareholders. Its reliability is based on robust capital levels, prudent expense management and a focus on valuable customer relationships.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe third choice’s consistent financial performance and strategic investments position it for long-term benefits. Notably, its innovative deposit-oriented solutions, strong consumer and commercial segments and embedded payments business contribute to its competitive edge in the market.Given those factors, consider adding these bank stocks to your portfolio post Q2 earnings. What are these financial institutions? Let’s take a look.HSBC Holdings (HSBC)HSBC logo on corporate buildingSource: ShutterstockHSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) achieved a robust profit performance across all major geographies and global businesses. That indicates the effectiveness of its current strategy. Excluding the gain on SVB U.K. and the partial reversal of impairments on the potential sale of the French retail bank, HSBC delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 19.3%.Furthermore, HSBC’s vigorous platform for growth is evident through its well-equalized balance sheet, broad-based geographic profit generation and a combination of net and non-net interest income. In Q1 2023, the bank experienced an inflow of newly invested assets amounting to $22 billion, with a cumulative $93 billion over the last year. Thus, this signifies the traction gained by its wealth strategy.Story continuesOne of the reasons for HSBC’s confidence in the future is the diversity and connectivity of its geographical footprint. The bank derives valuable growth opportunities through access to markets with good growth and returns potential. It includes Hong Kong, Mainland China, the Middle East, and the United Kingdom.Interestingly, HSBC’s acquisition of SVB U.K. presents a stance to invest in growth, particularly in the technology and life sciences sectors. That aligns with the bank’s focus on supporting entrepreneurs and future business creators. The acquisition positions HSBC favorably to take these businesses global, further enhancing its growth prospects.Notably, the bank’s decision to resume quarterly dividends and announce a share buyback of up to $2 billion reflects its strong capital generation. The increase in capital returns demonstrates the bank’s financial strength and stability.Looking ahead, HSBC’s management emphasizes cost discipline while supporting its businesses to deliver growth and returns. Finally, the bank’s focus on technology investment and limiting cost growth to approximately 3% in 2023 is critical.PNC Financial Services (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comPNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC) is well-positioned to benefit over the long term. One key benefit is its substantial capital and liquidity levels, which provides the company with the flexibility to address upcoming regulatory changes. With an estimated CET1 ratio of 9.5% as of June 30, 2023, PNC is well above regulatory minimums. The bank has also improved its stress capital buffer to the required level of 2.5%. The company’s robust capital position allows it to support customers, grow its business and deliver returns for shareholders.Similarly, expense control is another area of focus for PNC. It has successfully managed costs despite inflationary pressures and higher FDIC assessment rates. The company has a continuous improvement program targeting an additional $50 million increase to reach $450 million in expense savings for 2023, further enhancing its financial performance.Also, PNC’s credit quality remains strong, reflecting its diversified lending franchise and focus on valuable, long-term customer relationships. Non-performing loans represent less than 1% of total loans. Also, the net charge-off ratio remained low at 24 basis points in the second quarter.The company has demonstrated its commitment to shareholders by increasing its quarterly common stock dividend by $0.05, indicating its confidence in future earnings and ability to return capital to investors.PNC is cautiously optimistic about the economy, expecting a mild recession to start in early 2024. Despite this, the company anticipates stable loan growth, an increase in non-interest income, and relatively stable expenses for Q3 2023. Lastly, PNC expects moderate loan growth, a modest increase in total revenue, and a slight decline in non-interest income due to soft capital markets revenue.Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB)Fifth Third Bank sign on brick buildingSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comFifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) has demonstrated consistent financial performance and strategic investments that position the bank for long-term benefits. Despite market volatility, FITB has reported second-quarter solid earnings per share of $0.87, a 10% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Its adjusted revenue increased by 9%, reflecting diverse fee sources and a hardy balance sheet. Favorably, its credit quality has remained strong, with net charge-offs and delinquencies below normalized levels.Additionally, FITB’s return metrics have improved, achieving a decent adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.4%. Also, the efficiency ratio is below 55%, showcasing the bank’s ability to adapt to regulatory changes.The bank’s focus on deposits has also been successful, as total period-end deposits increased by 2% YoY. The company was outperforming many competitors when deposit growth system-wide was in decline. The success is attributed to deliberate strategies, such as expanding distribution in Southeast markets and launching innovative deposit-oriented solutions.Also, FITB’s consumer and commercial segments have shown significant growth. Specifically, it has reported consumer net household growth of 3% year-on-year and many new quality middle-market relationships added in the commercial segment.Looking ahead, FITB is proactively adapting its balance sheet to meet impending regulatory changes, enhancing capital levels and liquidity requirements. Finally, the bank aims to build capital quickly, supporting dividend increases and driving organic growth for clients.On the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A new report from Nerdwallet estimates that back-to-school shopping will cost parents $600 on average per child this year. As Nerdwallet Senior Writer Kimberly Palmer explains, because of higher prices, ""back-to-school shopping is really putting a lot of financial strain on parents this year."" Palmer joins Yahoo Finance Live to give some tips that parents can use to keep costs down.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: With August just around the corner, literally tomorrow, parents will be preparing their kids to head back to school and the price tag that comes with it. The National Retail Federation says inflation may cause 2023 to be the most expensive year yet, with spending estimated to surpass $135 billion.NerdWallet estimates it will cost about $600 on average per child and found many parents will have to dip into savings or go into debt to afford it. Kimberly Palmer is a senior writer at NerdWallet and joins us now. Kimberly, thanks so much for joining us. Let's dig into this data that you all called. First, what is expected to be the priciest thing in terms of back to school purchases this year?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, in general, back to school shopping is really putting a lot of financial strain on parents this year. Because prices are higher, you still need to fulfill that list that you get from schools. And the priciest items tend to be things like electronics. A lot of kids need computers, graphing calculators. As you get older, the items just get more expensive. And then, of course, kids also want things like backpacks, clothing, and all of that adds up really quickly.SEANA SMITH: Kimberly, how is this then I guess affected some of the shopping attempts here or strategies, I should say, from parents in terms of where they're looking to save, when they are buying, has that shifted at all given the fact that so many parents are under financial pressure?Story continuesKIMBERLY PALMER: It has. Parents are really getting creative about how they're saving money this year. So first of all, they're being really careful to stick to the lists provided by the schools. So as soon as you get that school list, you can see that it is pretty limited because schools are mindful of the fact that parents are under so much financial strain.So your children might be asking you to buy more things off list, but you can absolutely stick to that list. Also check what items you already have around the house that might be that you bought extra binders last year and you can reuse them this year or reuse that backpack because that's another big ticket item.I think one of the most creative strategies that I've heard of is parents teaming up with each other because in a lot of cases you can buy in bulk together and then share the cost and then that can make your overall budget a little bit easier.DIANE KING HALL: And Kimberly, I want to ask you about something that we've talked about here and you are a parent as well, I know. So what's a way to get around some of these pricier things? I know there are certain days, for instance, you can shop on. What's your tip there?KIMBERLY PALMER: There are. So the biggest tip is that you want to spread out your purchases. And some school systems make this a little easier for you by giving out those school shopping lists early in July. So some parents have actually already started shopping and took advantage of those July summer sales. But don't worry if you haven't, it's not too late because we'll see some pop up discounts.It's a lot of times based on your local district and when your kids are going back to school. So you want to check for those local sales. And then meanwhile, you want to think about spreading out your purchases too and even waiting until October for some of those items because kids don't need everything on day one. You can often wait to buy some things until second semester.And when it comes to clothing, especially fall clothing, you definitely want to try to wait to buy until we get a little closer to winter because the sales will be much better.SEANA SMITH: You can really-- actually, I had a question on that because the estimate that we have on the screen is that it's expected to exceed $600 per child. Does that include clothing?KIMBERLY PALMER: It does. So we actually ask families how much do you expect to spend this year on back to school shopping. And so that does include-- it goes beyond not just what the schools are requiring you to buy, but all of those other items as well. And yes, I have kids myself and I know they ask for much more than that's on the list. And so that's why it easily adds up.And some portion of parents actually say they'll spend over $1,000. So you can see how that becomes such a strain.DIANE KING HALL: Wow, oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. Over $1,000, I'm like, wow. Because when you go to the store for this stuff, yes, you can get the folders, the notebooks, et cetera, for cheaper. And especially, when you take your kids with you, they start, like, asking for things and that can add up if it's hard for you to say no.But talk to me about the tax holiday thing because some parents are newer to this, the list. Their kids are just starting out in school. What's the detail about that that parents should know about?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, the most important thing to know about tax holidays is that it's state-specific. So you want to check on what your state offers in terms of tax holidays because a lot of them come up in August. And you can actually take advantage of that for your back to school shopping.So you want to check what categories you're able to shop during that tax-free holiday and then go ahead and do that because you can really save some money there, and this year, every little bit helps.DIANE KING HALL: And what can people think about getting besides looking around to see what you have, but, like, second hand or something like that to help kind of keep these costs down, especially when we think about where inflation is now, Kemberly?KIMBERLY PALMER: Well, one big trend this year actually is looking at refurbished items, so especially when you're looking at electronics. So anything like computers or graphing calculators, anything in that category, it's worth checking to see what refurbished options are available because you can save big. And that way your kids still have a great product, but you are not spending as much as you would otherwise on an all new product.SEANA SMITH: All right, Kimberly Palmer, great to get your perspective. Thanks so much for joining us here today.]"

The same for earnings per share is pegged at 49 cents, indicating a year-over-year decline of 68.2%. The consensus mark for the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings has moved down 6% in the past 30 days.Q2 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, WestRock reported a year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share and revenues. While the top line missed the consensus estimate, earnings beat the same.WRK’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four trailing quarters, while falling short in one quarter, delivering an earnings surprise of 11.9%, on average.WestRock Company Price and EPS Surprise WestRock Company Price and EPS SurpriseWestRock Company price-eps-surprise | WestRock Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteWestRock has been witnessing a slowdown in volumes in the corrugated packaging segment over the past few quarters. This has been mainly due to muted customer spending owing to the inflationary scenario. Customers have been also been rebalancing their inventory destocking.Despite this overall weakness, the demand for corrugated packaging and containerboard for the packaging of essentials items such as food, beverage and medicines are likely to have remained stable. However, considering that the company has been facing labor shortages and supply-chain issues, this is expected to have impacted thr shipments to customers. All of these factors are likely to get reflected in the company’s top-line results in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.While some costs were expected to have been favorable sequentially (natural gas, virgin fiber, chemicals and freight), the same is likely to have been higher than the last year’s comparable quarter. Higher recycled fiber costs are also likely to have hurt its margins.Story continuesUnfavorable non-cash pension expenses due to higher interest rates and market volatility are also expected to have impacted its profits in the fiscal third quarter.  The company’s results are also likely to reflect the impact of approximately 121K tons of maintenance downtime, which is higher than the 46K of downtime in the last year’s quarter.Pricing actions and productivity initiatives undertaken by the company are likely to have negated some of these headwinds. The company is expected to achieve $250 million in cost savings in fiscal 2023. A portion of this is expected to have benefited its third-quarter results.Segmental ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WRK’s Consumer Packaging segment’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,211 million, suggesting a 5% drop from the prior-year period's reported figure. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $144 million, indicating a year-over-year plunge of 39%.For the Corrugated Packaging segment’s revenues, the consensus estimate is pinned at $2,597 million, implying growth of 9% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA is projected at $62 million, indicating an 84% year-over-year fall.The revenue estimate for the Paper segment is pegged at $1,130 million, suggesting a decline of 30% from the prior-year reported figure. The same for the Distribution segment is pinned at $341 million, indicating a 5% year-over-year decline.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for WestRock this time around.

CRI reported second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line came in line. However, both metrics fell year over year. Results were hurt by the impacts of inflation, which led to reduced spending. On the flip side, it continued to witness higher-than-planned demand in its wholesale business for the third consecutive quarter, driven by the strength of product offerings and lower inventory.Q2 in DetailCarter’s reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. However, the figure fell 51% from the $1.30 posted in the prior-year quarter.The company reported net sales of $600 million, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the metric declined 14% from the $700.7 million posted in the year-ago period. The downside can be attributed to inflation, rising interest rates, higher consumer debt levels and risk of recession, which affected the demand from consumers and wholesale customers. Unfavorable foreign currency translations hurt sales of $1.2 million or 0.2%.CRI also witnessed better store performance than e-commerce, as people are returning to stores post the COVID-19 pandemic. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Segmental SalesSales in the U.S. Retail segment decreased 15% to $323.5 million year over year and lagged our estimate of $327.5 million. Comparable retail sales fell 15.9% in the second quarter due to unseasonably cool weather weighed on consumer demand in the earlier months of the quarter. However, it witnessed improvement in the retail sales trend since the Memorial Day weekend and has continued into July.The U.S. Wholesale segment’s sales dipped 17% year over year from $186.9 million but beat our estimate of $179.6 million. Inflation, higher interest rates and rising consumer debt affected the wholesale customer demand.The International segment witnessed an 8% year over year drop in revenues from $89.9 million to $92.2 million in the second quarter due to cooler weather in Canada. The metric lagged our estimate of $93.3 million.Story continuesMarginsGross profit declined 12% year over year to $291.9 million but marginally beat our estimate of $290.7 million. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 140 basis points to 48.6%.Further, adjusted operating income declined 50% year over year to $37.9 million in the reported quarter but came ahead of our estimate of $34.9 million. The adjusted operating margin declined 450 basis points to 6.3% in the quarter under review.Balance Sheet &amp; Shareholder-Friendly MovesThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) player ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $175 million, long-term debt of $497 million, and shareholders’ equity of $775 million.The company’s total liquidity at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1 billion, with $846 million in unused borrowing capacity out of an $850-million secured revolving credit facility.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company returned $58.5 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. In the quarter under review, it repurchased 0.4 million shares of its common stock for $30.3 million. As of Jul 27, 2023, CRI had a $701-million remaining capacity under its previously announced repurchase authorization.Also, it paid out a dividend of 75 cents per common share in the said quarter.Carter's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Carter's, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Carter's, Inc. QuoteOutlookFor the third quarter of 2023, net sales are expected to be $770-$790 million. Adjusted earnings are likely to be $1.45-$1.55, suggesting a decline from the $1.68 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $80-$85 million, implying a dip from the $91.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The third-quarter guidance indicates continued inflationary pressure on consumer demand.

Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance;(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the extent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments; and(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.In addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the calculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance sheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.Financial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange RatesWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in the table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below provides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange

269,8cd1402f-9619-3d06-bb20-df93c6a9f0d5,APH,2023-08-01,Is Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporation-nyse-aph-potentially-130035400.html,1690808435,STORY,['APH'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Amphenol’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Amphenol What Is Amphenol Worth?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Amphenol’s ratio of 27.44x is above its peer average of 17.34x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Electronic industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Amphenol’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Amphenol look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amphenol's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? APH’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe APH should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on APH for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for APH, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Amphenol mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

In the first quarter, global smartphone shipments slipped by 13%, according to research firm Canalys.As a result, semiconductor companies have built up a glut of excess chips on their shelves. Some investors are worried that these firms, including Qualcomm, will drive down chip prices to clear out backlogs, subsequently placing pressure on gross margins.But in a note to clients on Monday, the JPMorgan analysts defended their ""favorable view"" of Qualcomm heading into the results on Wednesday. Almost two weeks ago, the analysts gave an upbeat prediction for San Diego-based Qualcomm's fiscal third-quarter returns, citing ""very early signs"" of recovery in the global smartphone market.The analysts argued that the latest returns for Qualcomm's Taiwanese peer MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) bolster their case. Revenues at MediaTek expanded on a quarterly basis in the second quarter, they noted, and are expected to continue growing in the current three-month period thanks in part to ""improved trends in smartphones.""Smartphone supplier Amphenol (NYSE:APH) also posted quarterly revenue that beat estimates, the analysts said. They added that the electronic connector maker expects its mobile handset revenue ""to increase at a more robust pace and at an above seasonal level.""Given these trends, the analysts said they continued to see ""upside relative to investor expectations for Qualcomm,"" and reiterated their overweight rating of the stock.Related ArticlesStory continuesQualcomm results may have 'upside relative to investor expectations' - JPMorganAston Martin to issue $270 million worth of shares to bolster capitalUS announces trial payment program for care providers of dementia patients]"

Occupancy for the week ended May 6 came in at 72.9%, up 0.5% year over year. Occupancy for the week ending Jul 22 was the highest level since the week of Aug 10, 2019.

KTB is set to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 3 before market open. The bottom line of this global lifestyle apparel company is expected to have decreased year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 66 cents per share for the second quarter has been stable in the past 30 days. The figure shows a decline of 39.5% from earnings of $1.09 per share in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $625.5 million, indicating a rise of 1.9% from the prior-year reported figure.This Greensboro, NC-based company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.6%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 1.8%.Key Things to NoteKontoor Brands remains focused on boosting growth at its direct-to-consumer channels and enhancing its footprint across the international markets. The company has been making strategic investments in talent, demand creation and innovation to aid growth. Its brands have also been performing well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Lee and Wrangler brands are currently pegged at $201 million and $422 million, respectively. These estimates show corresponding increase of 2.6% and 1% year over year.However, the company’s bottom-line results are likely to have shown the impacts of a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures. In fact, inflationary pressures on input costs have been concerning. In addition, currency headwinds remain deterrents. These weaknesses, coupled with any deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to have hurt Kontoor Brands’ earnings performance in the quarter under review.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Kontoor Brands this time around.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications What Is Verizon Communications's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2023 Verizon Communications had US$157.3b of debt, an increase on US$151.2b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$4.92b in cash leading to net debt of about US$152.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Verizon Communications' LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$51.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$232.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$4.92b in cash and US$23.7b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$254.8b.This deficit casts a shadow over the US$143.1b company, like a colossus towering over mere mortals. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. After all, Verizon Communications would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Verizon Communications has net debt to EBITDA of 3.2 suggesting it uses a fair bit of leverage to boost returns. But the high interest coverage of 7.2 suggests it can easily service that debt. Unfortunately, Verizon Communications saw its EBIT slide 7.7% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Verizon Communications's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Considering the last three years, Verizon Communications actually recorded a cash outflow, overall. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.Our ViewWe'd go so far as to say Verizon Communications's level of total liabilities was disappointing. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. Taking into account all the aforementioned factors, it looks like Verizon Communications has too much debt. That sort of riskiness is ok for some, but it certainly doesn't float our boat. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Verizon Communications   you should know about.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt?As you can see below, NVIDIA had US$11.0b of debt, at April 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But it also has US$15.3b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$4.37b net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$7.26b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$15.3b in cash and US$4.08b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$540.0m more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Having regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.16t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIn fact NVIDIA's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 60% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Summing UpWe could understand if investors are concerned about NVIDIA's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.37b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$5.1b, being 86% of its EBIT. So we are not troubled with NVIDIA's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with NVIDIA .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.S&amp;P 500 Sectors Were All Green from June to July 2023In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)Story continuesThrough May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.A sign hangs above the entrance of a Kohl's store on March 1, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois.

To skip our detailed analysis of current trends in the artificial intelligence sector, you can take a look at the 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the markets can talk about these days and for good reason. This form of technology has managed to revolutionize the tech industry in a shockingly short period of time, making every major tech company out there think that the AI space is where they have to be in 2023. Companies across a whole range of fields are quickly making AI investments their top priority, as several surveys conducted this year have shown.AI Investments On The RiseOne such survey is the CNBC Technology Executive Council survey, the results of which were announced on June 23. The survey asked companies about which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months. Options in the answer included AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Of the companies answering the survey, 47.37% said that AI would be their top choice, while 21.05% and 10.53% voted for cloud computing and IoT, respectively. Based on this survey, it can be said that the AI boom will continue to dominate the tech narrative over the foreseeable future just as much as it has been dominating this year. The survey also revealed that 58% of the voting companies saw AI as a critical tech strategy they will be implementing over the next 12 months. Additionally, 53% of the respondents noted that machine learning (ML) will be their critical tech strategy over the same period. Finally, when it comes to AI spending, 63% of the respondents noted that they are accelerating their investments in this technology, 37% of the respondents noted that they are proceeding with caution when it comes to AI spending, and no respondent said that they are not investing in AI.These statistics highlight just how widespread and pervasive the current AI buzz really is. This bodes well for companies massively invested in this space, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). A look at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent disclosure of its AI chatbot Co-Pilot's subscription fees shows just how much these companies are banking on AI today. The subscription fee was announced at $30 per month, and according to CNBC on July 25, the potential market for this product is ""huge."" This is unsurprising considering the fact that ""hundreds of millions"" of Microsoft 365 users are currently making up the potential user base for this new subscription. Additionally, analysts are expected segments like the Azure Cloud business to also help Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefit from the AI boom. This segment has seen slowing growth recently, but in light of the company's active involvement in the AI space, analysts now forecast a growth of 25% for Azure Cloud in the latest quarter.Story continuesThese are just some of the exciting developments brewing in the tech and AI space this year. There's much more to keep an eye on if you are looking to buy into the AI boom in the hopes of benefitting from it in the long run. Considering the vast range of possibilities presented by AI this year, we have compiled a list of some of the most advanced AI companies in the market today. These include the biggest AI companies in the world alongside several emerging AI companies that have been innovating in this space.Most Advanced AI CompaniesPhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyUsing a consensus-based approach by consulting several sources online, we have selected AI companies that have been making innovative moves in the sector this year. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank them.Most Advanced AI Companies11. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company. It is based in Redwood City, California. The company's platform provides an application development and runtime environment enabling customers to design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI applications. Its new product, C3 Generative AI for Enterprise Search, gives enterprise users access to generative AI tech in data management and more.Joe Goodwin, an analyst at JMP Securities, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of July 24. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $38 to $40.There were 24 hedge funds long C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $151.9 million.Here's what Kerrisdale Capital said about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March 2023 investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc.

288,0501d5d1-fa99-33a3-847b-faed3e078cc8,NVDA,2023-08-01,AI 'driving' valuation growth for Big Tech stocks: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-driving-valuation-growth-big-171849913.html,1690823929,VIDEO,"['GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'AAPL', 'MSFT']","[Tech companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA are set to report earnings in August. Constellation Research Principal Analyst and Founder R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk about what he calls ""MATANA"" stocks, also known as Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, NVIDIA, and Amazon. Wang explains how ""AI is driving the valuation growth"" and how ""there was pre-Chat GPT and then post-Chat GPT,"" for these tech stocks.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: So still confident in the MATANA stocks here. But as we talk about generative AI, what are the key differentiators in how these companies are mentioning and using it?R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah. There's a great difference between the folks that are actually using it, the folks that are actually producing it, and the folks that are supplying the tools to make it happen, right? And the tool makers, of course, are the Nvidia's of the world with the GBUs and of course, Google in the future with TPUs and then Microsoft if they get into the chip game. And then of course, we've got the companies that are actually doing the processing, which is in the cloud.So you see that with Google, Amazon, Microsoft leading that way, and then you've got companies that are using it like Adobe, Oracle, ServiceNow and C3. Those are the ones that are creating this AI empire. And we do see that. AI is driving the valuation growth. We were dead in November 2022. There was pre-ChatGPT and then post ChatGPT. You could see the tech starts starting to grow. So that's the big thing.But the second thing we discovered was ads are back for the few companies that are left and the ones that are actually growing, of course-- here's where Meta comes into play, Google comes into play, and what we'll be looking for is Amazon and Apple. Apple doesn't break out its advertising revenues, but Amazon is now the third largest digital ad player in the market.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And we knew that there was this pull back in ad spending. Why do you think people are honing back into some of these stalwarts when it comes to eyes for consumers and ads?Story continuesR ""RAY"" WANG: Rachelle, it's a great question. I think what happens is if you've got the network, you've got the power to reach out to folks, and there are very few mass marketing capabilities left. And so Amazon has amazing reach because of commerce, Google has amazing reach because of search, and of course, Alphabet or-- Alphabet has amazing reach because of search.And then of course, we're seeing what's going on with Facebook because of the network effects on Meta. Now that also means other companies like Spotify, who are showing some growth. Yes, music isn't going to carry you all the way. Netflix subscriptions aren't going to carry all the way and you need to have multiple monetization models to be able to survive.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk about the cloud, especially as we look at what happened with Microsoft's drop in cloud growth here. What is the story there? And how temporary is? Is this part of a new normal? A shift that we should expect when it comes to cloud.R ""RAY"" WANG: Well, the reason I say it's cloudy times ahead is because we're seeing some interesting usage of the cloud. A lot of companies just took their stuff and put it onto the cloud and hoped it was going to get cheaper, but now a new class of CIOs are doing something different. They're taking cloud hosting costs and cloud operating costs from maybe $1,000 a month and getting it down to $100 a month.And so we're about to see some rationalization and cloud usage just as of AI is picking up. And so we've got to see what happens if cloud contracts are coming down or if cloud usage is going to go down. And so Microsoft got through that. Amazon, we're going to watch very carefully on what their numbers are on August 3, and that will give us an indicator of what's going on. But Google didn't do too bad. They are flat at 28%. It is the summer, and we're going to see more pickup usually in the fall.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And of course, we have to talk Apple whether it's becoming that $3 trillion stock or whether it's-- what they're doing with their own sort of chip making there. What are your expectations and have they really outperformed the way that you thought they would?R ""RAY"" WANG: No, they've done really well given where the market is. There's an expectation that revenues are going to decline again in this quarter. It's been two quarters of decline, but we're still in a supercycle of refresh for iPhones, and it's not about the number of iPhone sales, and we won't see iPhone 15 sales if they make that announcement in the future. What this is about is how much can be made per iPhone. It's about the services revenue and Apple's story around that is very important. It's because they've been able to grow the revenue per device, and that's an important number to look at.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Amazon as well because we've talked about cloud, especially when it comes to Microsoft there. But what about Amazon as well and the growth story there? Because I mean, we're hearing bits and bobs about their AI plans as well but not really as-- it's not really a big topic of conversation to the extent that we would have expected.R ""RAY"" WANG: Yeah, so here's the interesting thing. There's been a lot of cost cutting at core Amazon. They've actually rejiggered their supply chains and their capacity and their warehouses, but they've improved the automation and what they're able to do now is deliver at a package or deliver any kind of parcel at a cost lower than anybody else, more automated than anyone else, and more track than anyone else, which means they can start using AI machine learning internally to drive down the cost.And then the second piece is where is AWS growth? And AWS, right now, is actually winning among partner mindshares. Large partners are actually being embraced by AWS, which wasn't the case in the past, and they're seeing that level of growth that's very, very different than some of the other partnerships that we've seen in the cloud. So we're looking at those two factors-- core Amazon performance, and of course, what's going on with AWS.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer's 5 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.The S&amp;P 500 was under immense pressure in 2022, going down by 19.4% as most of its listings crumbled amid the push by the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. Inflation near record highs meant few investors had the stomach to take up risk in the equity markets, all but fueling the selloff. Recession fears and the Russian-Ukraine war all but accelerated the selloff spree. Amid the bearish sentiments in the market, CNBC's Jim Cramer was overly concerned over whether the market will bounce back amid the steep selloff.The Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive monetary tightening spree in the race to clamp down on inflationary pressures that were getting out of hand spelled more trouble, according to Cramer. Amid the interest hiking spree, the CNBC commentator warned of the potential recession risk that could significantly affect investors' sentiments.The warnings did not come as a surprise as Cramer tends to be bearish on the market and its prospects regardless of the ongoings. While he has been a staple of the financial news industry for decades, Cramer sometimes gets things wrong, which has seen him become the laughingstock of Wall Street. Given that his predictions are often controversial, with a portion of them turning out wrong, some investors often shun them or opt to do the opposite of what he does.The fact that some of Cramer’s predictions rarely come to fruition has led to the creation of a Twitter account called Inverse Jim Cramer. The account is best known for taking the opposite position on Cramer's financial decisions about the stock market.Chevron was one of Cramer’s top picks at the start of the year. He insisted it was becoming cheaper and cheaper as it went down. The CNBC Mad Money host reiterated that the stock would be a winner as long as oil prices stayed above the $60-a barrel level. However, that has not been the case, as the stock has already lost more than 9% in market value and remains under pressure.Story continuesOne prediction that Cramer might want to forget sooner than later is that of Silicon Valley bank parent company SVB Financials. While making the prediction, the CNBC commentator reiterated that it will be one of the biggest winners of 2023 alongside other blue-chip stocks like Tesla and Meta.“This company is a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall Street has mistakenly been concerned by,” Cramer said in the clip.That prediction came to bite as Silicon Valley Bank went under at the height of the banking crisis that I regional banks.Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023Nevertheless, Cramer is sometimes wrong, and whenever he gets it right, there is always something to smile about. Despite getting it wrong with Chevron and SVB Financials, Cramer also reiterated that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as some of the best stocks to consider in 2023. True to his predictions, the stocks have lived up to expectations and emerged as key drivers of the overall bull market.Even though the overall market is trading well above its recent lows, plenty of stocks are trading less than they were a year ago. Some of these stocks boast impressive risk-reward given the tremendous upside potential. As valuation concerns become a big issue after the massive rally year to date, CNBCs Cramer believes there are stocks likely to fair well even on the economy plunging into recession.Our MethodologyThe list of Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 stock picks for 2023 takes into considerations stock picks that the CNBC’s commentator predicted will outperform the market in 2023 at the start of the year. He chose five stocks from each of the groups of the highest and lowest performers in the S&amp;P 500 in 2022 that might be winners in 2023.While some of the stocks have lived up to expectations and rallied significantly others have been a big disappointment. We ranked the stocks based on their gains from when Cramer made his predictions. Overall, an equal weighted portfolio of these 10 stocks returned nearly 25% year-to-date and outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index.10. V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)Upside Potential: 21.30%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -29% Price to earnings multiple: 9V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is a big miss in Cramer’s predictions. The CNBC commentator expected the company to bounce back while betting that the new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help reinvigorate the company's fortunes. However that has not been the case as the stock is down by 29% year to date.V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC)'s growth metrics have mostly been cut short by inflation and other macro headwinds. Intermittent lockdowns in China last year and currency headwinds have also affected its revenue base. Consequently, the stock is down by about 29% year to date.Consequently, V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is trading with a price-to-earnings multiple of 9 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. In addition, analysts on Wall Street have a $23.86 price target on the stock implying a 21.30% upside potential.  9. Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH)Upside Potential: 38.98%  Gain since Cramer Prediction: -23%  Price to earnings multiple: 34Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) has been a big disappointment as it is down by about 23% year to date. The underperformance comes against the backdrop of Cramer terming the energy company a renewable golden boy at the beginning of the year.The company designs, develop, manufactures, and sells home energy solution for the solar photovoltaic industry. While it has underperformed the overall market, Cramer believes the company remains well positioned to benefit from the clean energy push in the US.The company delivered impressive Q2 results with revenues increasing 34.1%  to $711.1 million despite missing estimates of $727 million.  The bottom line increased 37.4% to $1.47 a share beating consensus estimates of $1.27 a share.The stock trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34 compared to an average of 26 for S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $240.94, implying a 38.94% upside potential from current levels.8. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Upside Potential: 11.90% Gain since Cramer Prediction: -13% Price to earnings multiple: 20Cramer believes Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. The company operates as an aerospace and defense company providing aircraft systems workwise. It delivered impressive Q1 results with earnings of $5.50 a share against $5.09 a share expected on revenues of $9.3 billion against the $9.2 billion that Wall Street expected.Early in the year Cramer touted Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC) as one of the best defense contractors as the Russia-Ukraine war persists. However, that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed going by the 13% decline year to date.While Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has been under pressure going down by 13% year to date, it's been under consolidation in recent months. Likewise, it trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 compared to 26 for the S&amp;P 500. The average price target on the stock is $511.55, repressing an 11.90% upside potential from current levels.7. Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)Upside Potential: 19.08% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 1.03% Price to earnings multiple: 12At the start of the year Cramer predicted Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will have a multiyear rally. However that has not been the case as it is only up by about 1% year to date compared to an 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500.Nevertheless, the company's sentiments have improved significantly, going by the 35% rally over the past two months. The rally has come at the back of an uptick in energy prices.Expectations that oil prices will find support above the $80 a barrel level strengthens the oil field services company's outlook. The provider of products and services for the energy industry is likely to benefit from the booming energy industry by year-end.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) already exhibits strong financial metrics with earnings per share of $2.16, operating margin of 16.21%, and return on invested capital of 15.61%. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 12, Haliburton boasts of a solid 1.67% dividend yieldCramer predicts that Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has a multiyear rally ahead as the average price target is $45.50, implying a 19.08% upside potential from current levels.6. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Upside Potential: 11.69% Gain since Cramer Prediction: 7.4% Price to earnings multiple: 15McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is one stock that Cramer believes will do well even with the economy slowing down amid recession fears. However that has not been the case as the stock has underperformed on the overall market turning bullish. Its 7% gain is an understatement going by the 18% gain for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period.McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is already up by about 7% but boasts tremendous upside potential owing to its low valuation and long-term growth potential. Over the past three years, it has delivered over 400% return. It's fresh from increasing its dividend by 15%, affirming its ability to generate strong cash flows.The stock trades at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15, backed with a 0.60% dividend yield. With an average price target of $451, McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has an 11.69% upside potential from current levels.Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023.Suggested articles:20 Most Popular Airlines in the World12 Best Solar Energy and Battery Stocks To Buy NowTop 30 Most Hated Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. Jim Cramer's 10 S&amp;P 500 Stock Picks for 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Globus Medical exited the first quarter of 2023 with earnings and revenue beat. The robust growth of organic revenues in both the United States and the international market is impressive. Rapid market interest and customer demand have positioned Excelsius3D, the company’s latest addition to the Excelsius Ecosystem, as a major growth driver in 2023.Spine grew 14% in the quarter with notable gains across the company’s product portfolio in expandables, biologics, MIS screws, 3D printed implants and cervical offerings. This above market growth was driven by competitive rep recruiting from prior quarters, robotic pull-through and a normalization of post-COVID procedures compared to the prior year performance. In the first quarter, Globus Medical launched its MARS TLIF pedicle-based retractor as part of the company’s focus on procedural efficiency to offer specialized options to meet surgeon preferences. The company has also continued to make significant progress in launching its prone lateral patient positioning system.Within Enabling technology sales improved 91% on a constant currency basis, driven by robotic and imaging system sales. This represented the company’s highest first-quarter robot sales. Globus Medical continued to see increased interest in sales with significant international gains of ExcelsiusGPS in EMEA and Asia Pacific that will lead to future implant pull-through and strong market share gains. Robotic procedures continue to accelerate, growing 51% from the prior year and exceeding 49,000 robotic procedures performed till the first-quarter earnings call.Globus Medical, Inc. PriceGlobus Medical, Inc. PriceGlobus Medical, Inc. price | Globus Medical, Inc. QuoteIn terms of NuVasive’s acquisition deal, with the complementary strengths of Globus Medical engineering and NuVasive relations, education and training, GMED aims to outpace market growth, leading to accelerated EPS growth and an increase in cash flows for investors. This all-stock structure preserves cash to deleverage the company and accelerate investment in assets to fuel growth. The combination capitalizes on GMED’s complementary commercial organization and should allow the company to accelerate its globalization strategies to increase customer reach and strengthen surgeon relationships.A strong solvency position is an added positive.Story continuesOn the flip side, related to the antitrust approval on the company’s planned merger with NuVasive, both the companies recently received an SEC request from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission regarding the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) filing. As a result, the expected close of the merger has been delayed from mid-2023 to the third quarter of 2023.Meanwhile, escalating expenses are putting pressure on the operating margin. SG&amp;A expenses in the reported quarter were up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by sales compensation, as well as higher meetings, travel and training expenses. In consequence, the adjusted operating margin contracted 55 bps in the quarter to 22.5%. Further, stiff competition and pricing pressure continue to pose challenges.Further, the musculoskeletal devices industry is characterized by intensifying competitive pricing pressure. Pricing continues to remain a major headwind for Globus Medical. We remain concerned about the pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost containment efforts by governmental healthcare, local hospitals and health systems.Further, the musculoskeletal devices industry faces intense competition as well as challenges of third-party coverage and reimbursement practices. Management believes that there will be continued pricing pressure in the future. If competitive forces drive down the prices the company charges for its products, its profit margins will shrink, thus affecting Globus Medical’s ability to maintain its profitability and invest in growing its business.Over the past year, shares of Globus Medical have underperformed its industry. The stock has rallied 5.9% compared with the 6.6% rise of the industry.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Haemonetics HAE and McKesson MCK.Zimmer Biomet has an earnings yield of 5.35% compared to the industry’s -3.65%. Zimmer Biomet’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.38%.

In the last reported quarter, CALID group’s organic revenues increased in the low 20%, along with very strong bookings of the timsTOF platform. Bruker NANO's academic, industrial and GreenTech Research and high-end semiconductor metrology revenues remained strong. However, competitive space and foreign currency fluctuations are worrisome for BRKR.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 0.1% against the 10.2% fall of the industry and an 11.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $10.14 billion. Bruker projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 18.2% compared with 13% of the industry. BRKR’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters and was break even in one, delivering an average surprise of 10.9%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong Prospects of BioSpin: In the first quarter of 2023, BioSpin Group’s revenues grew in the high-teens percentage on a constant-currency basis despite any gigahertz-class revenues in the first quarter. BioSpin saw robust growth in revenues across its full portfolio, including NMR and MRI preclinical imaging.Meanwhile, Bruker received two orders for 1.2 gigahertz NMRs in the first quarter, which will be placed at the University of Warwick and the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.  The systems are used for structural and functional biology and life-science research, GreenTech and materials research. With both institutions already having Bruker 1.0 GHz NMR spectrometer, the latest move highlights the expansion of fundamental research infrastructure in the UK.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCALID Group Holds Potential: In the first quarter, the constant-currency revenue growth of Bruker’s CALID Group was supported by strong life science mass spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopy businesses.Story continuesThe timsTOF platform continued its adoption in 4D proteomics, epiproteomics and multiomics. The company had excellent year-over-year growth in bookings and announced further key enhancements to advance capabilities.BSI Nano Group’s Prospects Look Bright: In the first quarter, Bruker Nano’s revenues grew in the low 20% on a constant-currency basis. NANO's academic, industrial and GreenTech Research and high-end semiconductor metrology revenues remained strong. Revenues for advanced X-ray and Nano Surfaces tools also delivered strong growth in the quarter.Further, NANO's microelectronics and semiconductor metrology tools performed well with strong bookings and backlogs.DownsidesA Competitive Landscape: Bruker faces substantial competition in a consolidating industry and expects the competition across its markets to increase further. Bruker BioSpin competes with companies that offer magnetic resonance spectrometers, mainly JEOL and Oxford Instruments. In the field of preclinical imaging, Bruker BioSpin faces a competitive threat from Perkin Elmer, Visualsonics (Fuji Film) and others.Unfortunately, many of Bruker’s peers have expanded their market share in recent years through business combinations. Other companies may also choose to enter Bruker’s fields of operation in the near future.Exposed to Currency Movements: Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses at the company.

Its earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, the average surprise being 4.48%.Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson’s earnings is pegged at $5.85 per share, implying an improvement of 0.3% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The same for revenues is pinned at $69.91 billion, indicating a surge of 4.1% year over year.Factors to NoteMcKesson’s fiscal first-quarter results are expected to reflect segmental strength.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment is likely to have acted as a key growth driver in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for this segment’s revenues is $62.7 billion, indicating an improvement of 10.2% from the prior-year quarter’s level.The segment is expected to have benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions might have weighed on its performance. Continued demand for MCK’s broad spectrum of specialty biopharmaceutical products to health systems is likely to have contributed to its performance.McKesson’s collaboration with the U.S. government over COVID-19 vaccine distribution highlighted its role in the COVID-19 response. However, COVID-19 tests, and kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies might have declined during the quarter, hurting the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment’s performance.However, continued growth in the Prescription Technology Solutions segment is expected to have benefited the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Growth in the technology services’ revenues and an increase in prescriptions from third-party logistics are likely to have driven segmental performance.Our top-line estimate for the Medical-Surgical and Prescription Technology Solutions segments is pegged at $2.56 billion and $1.16 billion, respectively.Story continuesMeanwhile, divesture of businesses outside the United States, especially in Europe, might have led to a loss of sales during the quarter, resulting in lower revenue growth for the International segment. Interest expenses are likely to have increased amid rising interest-rate regime, hurting the bottom line.The price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are strong headwinds.McKesson Corporation Price and ConsensusMcKesson Corporation Price and ConsensusMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteExpected Earnings BeatOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for McKesson this time around.

Air Products expects that this increase in capacity, coupled with new proprietary innovations in fabrication methods, will enable Air Products to improve equipment delivery schedules.Winding is a fabrication process for the internal components of coil-wound heat exchangers (CWHE) in which layers of tubes are wound around a central mandrel. This investment will increase Air Products' manufacturing capacity by almost 20 percent. This is on top of a previous expansion completed in 2019 that increased the facility's original capacity by 60 percent.  Known for reliability and efficiency, Air Products' liquefaction process technologies and equipment are used to produce a majority of the total worldwide LNG.""This continued investment in our manufacturing capacity reflects Air Products' commitment to serving the needs of the LNG industry with unrivaled liquefaction process technology and equipment.

Over 20 CWHEs have been shipped since. In October 2019, the first plant expansion was completed, following the installation of a new LNG Equipment Test Facility (ETF). The ETF allows for the collection of data to develop the next generation of innovative CWHEs. The Port Manatee facility also builds other specialty cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation and hydrocarbons, including columns, vessels, cold boxes, prefabricated plant modules, and skids.Story continuesAir Products' proprietary LNG process technology and equipment, vital to helping meet the world's increasing energy needs and desire for clean energy, processes and cryogenically liquefies valuable natural gas for consumer and industrial use. For over 50 years Air Products has manufactured LNG heat exchangers, which currently operate in over 100 LNG trains in 20 countries around the world.Typically, an LNG heat exchanger can be as large as over 15 feet (5 meters) in diameter and 180 feet (55 meters) long. A finished unit can weigh as much as 500 tons. Photos of Air Products' LNG technology can be downloaded for publication with proper attribution at http://prphotolibrary.airproducts.com/ImageViewer.aspx?q=LNG.Air Products' LNG process technology and equipment is the heart of an LNG production plant. The technology, in place at some of the most remote locations around the world, takes natural gas and unlocks its value by liquefying it and making it possible to ship it economically. The LNG is eventually re-gasified for energy uses.The majority of total worldwide LNG is produced with Air Products' technology. In support of the LNG industry, Air Products provides process technology and key equipment for the natural gas liquefaction process for large export plants, small and mid-sized LNG plants, floating LNG plants and LNG peak shavers.

300,c62e530a-f114-38c7-9099-21dba94a2070,APD,2023-08-01,"If You Can Only Buy One Hydrogen Stock, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-buy-one-hydrogen-stock-094214645.html,1690364534,STORY,"['BE', 'BP', 'APD']","[Hydrogen stocks hold a lot of promise currently. The world is undergoing an energy transition that is centered on limiting global warming and overall emissions. Hydrogen is particularly important in that fight as it doesn’t release carbon dioxide when it is combusted. Carbon dioxide emissions are among the chief greenhouse gases that raise the earth’s temperature. This has led to the rise of the top 3 hydrogen stocks for investors.It is thought that switching to hydrogen as a fuel source can greatly reduce emissions and preserve the planet’s health. Firms that produce hydrogen and related technologies are therefore of great interest to investors. The forecast growth in the market is impressive with reports suggesting 67% annual growth between 2022 and 2027.Here are the top 3 hydrogen stocks to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is a hydrogen stock for the purist. The company is young, growing quickly, and offers a unique platform for the generation of hydrogen and electricity. Bloom Energy’s Bloom Energy Server converts low-pressure natural gas or biogas into electricity and hydrogen. It is certainly among the more promising green energy stocks for investors to consider. What is particularly interesting from a fundamental standpoint is the firm’s growth. Bloom Energy revenues increased from $133.54 million to $193.75 million during the three months ended March 31. That 37% growth makes Bloom Energy undeniably interesting and provides a strong argument for the notion that the hydrogen economy is well on its way. Equally importantly, Bloom Energy’s losses declined by nearly $8 million during the same period. Those strong fundamentals perhaps contributed to RBC Capital’s recent initiation of coverage and $24 target price. That target price is largely in line with that which other analysts have assigned BE stock which currently trades below $18. Story continuesBP (BP)A magnifying glass zooms in on the BP (BP) logo and webpageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comBP (NYSE:BP) is a London-based firm and oil stock also known as British Petroleum. Oil firms in Europe are known for their greener stance and have generally invested more heavily in carbon reduction than their U.S. counterparts. What that means for investors is that BP offers exposure to hydrogen growth opportunities with the benefits of a major oil stock. You’re not going to receive the massive upside exposure of Bloom Energy but you will receive income in the form of a dividend yielding over 4% currently. BP is aiming to become a net zero firm by 2050 or earlier and n order to do so it is leveraging hydrogen.  In its domestic market, BP plans to provide 10% of U.K. hydrogen by 2030. Planning for its H2Teesside plant is underway and should result in 1 gigawatt (GW) of production by that time. 1 GW is enough to power roughly 800,000 homes for a year. The firm’s other hydrogen projects span Europe, Australia, and the U.S. Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is another stable firm and stock with a significant presence in hydrogen. The company’s stability is exemplified in its dividend which hasn’t been reduced since 1983. The company is heavily involved in hydrogen and boasts more than 100 plants globally. In fact, Air Products &amp; Chemicals is the world’s largest hydrogen producer with operations spanning the value chain. It also operates more than 250 fueling stations in 20 countries. As the company’s website notes, hydrogen has applications in automobiles, buses, trains, ships, and power generation. Air Products &amp; Chemicals is partnering with World Energy for a $2 billion expansion of the latter’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and distribution hub in Paramount, California. Air Products &amp; Chemicals will build, own, and operate the project and will also expand its pipeline in the process. Share prices have been steadily increasing but the good news is that APD traded quite a bit higher earlier this year. That suggests that there’s plenty of upside remaining. It remains a strong choice for investors who believe in the growth story surrounding the hydrogen opportunity and seek stability. This puts it firmly in the category of the top 3 hydrogen stocks.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Robinsonhas underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, the average miss being 1.39%. CHRW has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the remaining one quarter.Let’s see how things have shaped up for C.H. Robinson this earnings season.Q2 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C.H. Robinson’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.65 billion, indicating a 31.65% decline year over year. The top line is likely to have been weighed down bylower pricing in CHRW’s ocean and truckload services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North American Surface Transportation’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3,172 million, indicating a 23.5% decrease from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate indicates a decline of 34.8% year over year. Lower truckload pricing, reflecting softening freight demand, might have weighed on the segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Forwarding second-quarter revenues is pegged at $905 million, indicating a 56.7% decline from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate indicates a decline of 31.9% year over year. The downside is expected to have been caused by lower pricing in CHRW’s ocean services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for All Other and Corporate (Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation) second-quarter revenues is pegged at $552 million, indicating a 1.1% decline from the year-ago reported figure.However, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, might have dented C.H. Robinson’s bottom line in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CHRW’s second-quarter 2023 earnings has been revised downward by 6.7% in the past 90 days.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for C.H.

""However, the establishment of CWW has brought about partnerships with leading water experts like Water.org, The Nature Conservancy and many others that provide greater opportunity to collaborate, invest and engage in large-scale, high-impact water projects around the world.""Producing net water benefits that exceed the company's annual water usage in every region by 2030 is one of nine goals in Cummins' PLANET 2050 environmental sustainability strategy. While the initiative is already exceeding the company's water use overall, it is not yet doing that in every region where the company has a presence.There were many noteworthy Cummins Water Works projects to highlight in marking the July 23 anniversary. From oyster reef restoration helping filter water in Louisiana's Gulf region to improving water quality by re-introducing Kidney Shell Mussels in the U.S. Midwest to creating low-cost loan programs in India enabling families to install tap and toilet facilities in their homes, CWW is making great progress in addressing the world's water issues.In partnership with Water.org, Cummins Water Works has also launched an education program targeting 7- to 13- year olds in Brazil, teaching them about the importance of sanitation and clean water to public health.One of the bigger efforts took place in Guarulhos, Brazil, near Sao Paolo, the largest city in Brazil, where Water.org partnered with Trata Brasil, a public interest organization dedicated to improving sanitation. The effort held 18 learning sessions in three public schools to reach 1,200 students, 5 to 10 years of age, promoting environmental education through playful actions that focus on water supply and sanitary sewage.Through its operations in Mexico, Cummins is partnering with 50 Liter Home in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, to bring water and water filtration infrastructure to Los Kilometros in Mexico and Las Colonias in El Paso, on the outskirts of both cities, as well as provide rain gardens and community-based, green infrastructure.CWW's partnership with The Nature Conservancy has also worked to educate and encourage Midwestern farmers in the U.S. to implement conservation practices that reduce fertilizer runoff into waterways to eliminate the hypoxic (dead) zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The excess nutrients trigger algae blooms, which remove oxygen from the water and make it difficult or impossible for marine life to survive.Cummins leaders inspect an oyster reef restoration project in Louisiana.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.Cummins Inc., Monday, July 31, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/771294/Cummins-Program-To-Address-Global-Water-Crisis-Celebrates-2nd-Anniversary]"

The blockchain developer’s dealmaking streak was so prodigious that some on Crypto Twitter (now Crypto X?) called its business development team “chads,” online slang for alpha males.Yet, what many didn’t realize was that the two vice presidents—Jennifer Booze and Kelly DiGregorio—who led the majority of Polygon Labs’s blockbuster deals were women. And now, DiGregorio is set to become a dealmaker at another high-profile Web3 outfit: OpenSea.Polygon BD team are absolute giga chads. It's great to see the work and results they put out every month. pic.twitter.com/en57KMZI6d— Ninjasurprise.eth (@Ninjasurprise_) November 3, 2022On Tuesday, she and OpenSea, one of the largest marketplaces for non-fungible tokens, announced that she would become one of its handful of vice presidents and lead OpenSea’s global content partnerships. Her new position is an expanded role from her previous gig at Polygon Labs, where she was only in charge of entertainment and consumer business partnerships. (There were also gaming and large enterprise leads.)“Partnerships have been a focus of ours for some time,” Shiva Rajaraman, OpenSea’s chief business officer, said in a statement to Fortune. However, he and the rest of the company are excited by DiGregorio’s experience and what her prior successes “mean for OpenSea and the broader ecosystem.”The hiring of DiGregorio follows a period of turbulent waters for OpenSea, which, in addition to contending with a large downturn in the NFT market, is facing fierce competition from rival Blur. Her appointment is also comparatively rare in an industry where only 7% of Web3 founders are women, and 27% of all employees at the top companies aren’t men, according to a study released in February by the Boston Consulting Group. The majority of OpenSea’s vice presidents are women, a company spokesperson told Fortune.Story continues“Women have visibility within the inner industry circles,” DiGregorio told Fortune. “But more broadly, when it comes to these platforms, communities, there isn't an awareness of who's working on what, and there are incredible women working in the space.""DiGregorio started her almost-two-decade-long career when she worked at Time Warner, where she reviewed and greenlit the finances of various movies, TV shows, and other content. After stints at YouTube and FoxNext, which Disney acquired as part of its deal for 21st Century Fox in 2019, she worked at Dapper Labs, whose partnerships with brand name sports leagues like the NBA and NFL attracted a slew of headlines.In 2022, she jumped over to Polygon Labs, where she landed more headline-grabbing deals. “It does support the adoption of the technology overall, going more mainstream,” she told Fortune, in regards to why Web3 companies are so interested in linking arms with corporate brands.OpenSea, which has partnered with big-name companies such as Warner Music and Christie’s, is no stranger to the corporate world, but Rajaraman, the company’s chief business officer, hopes the hire of DiGregorio can help “evolve the use cases for NFT technology and welcome more brands—and by extension, consumers—into Web3.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Here's a sneak peekCabanas, daybeds and bungalows that surround the pool are available for rent on a first-come, first-served basis until the hotel begins taking reservations.The pool capacity near the slide is 45, while a third-floor pool can accommodate up to 589 people at once, according to Disney officials.Hours change with seasons, but the pool is currently open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., while the slide's hours will be 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.Only overnight guests of Paradise Pier and, eventually, Pixar Place will have access to the slide and aquatics facility.The latest additions are part of the hotel's evolution into Pixar Place, which is set to open this fall. A new lobby, game areas and restaurant are some of the changes on deck for the 15-story hotel.Currently, reservations are still being taken for Paradise Pier.The changes have been a boon for a few travel agents who book Disney vacations.Pittsburgh-based agent Amanda Emmerling, 37, who specializes in Disney vacations, sees the renovation as an attractive bonus for parents with young children.Story continuesEmmerling said she sells more vacation packages to Walt Disney World in Orlando but has experienced a recent uptick in sales to Anaheim.“The Pixar theme has been a winner,” she said. “I had a regular customer tell me recently that she’s willing to overcome the longer flight to take her kids to Cars Land [an auto-themed section of California Adventure] and stay at the Pixar hotel.”Read more: How Disney's Paradise Pier, the 'antithesis' of Walt, became California Adventure's Pixar PierEmmerling said she was scheduled to stay at Paradise Pier with her two young children earlier this year but postponed the vacation until Pixar was officially open.“The advantage Disneyland has over Disney World is that Disney World can be very overwhelming for young children while Disneyland’s two parks are right next to each other and the hotels are close,” Emmerling said. “Pixar Place just adds to that.”Heather Marshall, a 45-year-old Disney travel agent from DeMotte, Ind., stayed at Paradise Pier in February and was excited with the changes.“The bright colors and the cafe area looked amazing and it’s the little touches that make the hotel friendly,” said Marshall, a fan of Pixar’s “Toy Story” franchise. “The lobby is Pixar-themed and has the [Pixar] lamp and even the restrooms are Woody and Bo-Peep themed.

The firm delivered a negative earnings surprise of 3.03% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to NoteEnergy Transfer’s acquisition of Lotus Midstream Operations LLC assets in the second quarter is likely to have boosted earnings and expanded the firm’s operations in the Permian Basin. The buyout is also expected to have provided increased connectivity for its crude oil transportation and storage businesses.Ongoing expansion of ET’s Midstream operations through the inorganic route is likely to have contributed to the company’s second-quarter earnings. Energy Transfer is expected to have benefited from strong export volumes from its Nederland Terminal.Energy Transfer’s earnings is likely to have benefited from stable demand from strong customer base and fee-based contracts.  Energy Transfer’s quarterly results are expected to benefit from higher midstream gathered volumes and NGL production due to increased producer activity in Permian regions.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 30 cents per unit, implying a year-over-year decline of 23.1%. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $23.33 billion, indicating a year-over-year deterioration of 10.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NGL &amp; Refined Products terminal volume is pinned at 1,357.4 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), up 3.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for NGL &amp; Refined Product transportation volumes is pegged at 2,004 MBbls/d, up 4.8% year over year. Almost 60 facilities are connected to ET’s NGL pipelines that benefit from recent frac expansions at the Mont Belvieu complex. This is likely to have a positive impact on the company’s earnings.Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Energy Transfer this time around.

The leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices reported lower revenues year over year owing to declining demand trends and inventory adjustments stemming from challenging market conditions.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income declined to $11 million or 33 cents per American depositary share (ADS) from $51.6 million or $1.55 per ADS in the prior-year quarter. Sharp year-over-year top line contraction affected the bottom line during the quarter.Non-GAAP net income was $12.6 million or 38 cents per ADS compared with $62.8 million or $1.88 ADS in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents.Silicon Motion Technology Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSilicon Motion Technology Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Silicon Motion Technology Corporation QuoteRevenuesTotal revenues were $140.4 million, down 44.4% year over year but exceeded the consensus estimate of $135 million. The company’s top line was plagued by challenging market conditions. Sluggish demand trends in the PC and smartphone market have affected net sales. Many key suppliers are bringing down the inventory levels, including client SSD and eMMC/UFS embedded storage devices, which had a detrimental effect on the revenues. However, order patterns improved sequentially, leading to better visibility of a likely market recovery in the second half of the year.Revenues from eMMC+UFS controller sales declined by a staggering 65% to 70% year over year. SSD controller sales witnessed a sharp decline of 30% to 35%. Net sales for SSD solutions were down 25% to 30% year over year.Other DetailsIn the second quarter of 2023, non-GAAP gross profit was $59.7 million compared with $133.8 million in the year-ago quarter, with respective margins of 42.5% and 53%. The decline was primarily attributable to lower revenues year over year. Total operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis declined from $56.8 million in second-quarter 2022 to $48 million. Non-GAAP operating income fell from $77 million to $11.7 million, with margins of 30.5% and 8.3%, respectively.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityFor the first six months of 2023, Silicon Motion generated $43 million of cash from operating activities compared with a cash flow of $1.2 million in the year-ago period. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $249.8 million in cash and cash equivalents with $64.6 million of other liabilities. In the second quarter of 2023, the company’s capital expenditure totaled $10.1 million, including $2.9 million for the routine procurement of testing tools, software, design tools and other goods.OutlookSilicon Motion is optimistic about a more robust market recovery in the second half of 2023. It is taking several measures to enhance its gross margins, including reducing manufacturing costs, minimizing compensation-related expenses, discontinuing unprofitable product lines and streamlining research and development expenditures. Despite facing challenging market conditions, the company's management remains committed to providing cost-effective, high-quality, and unique solutions to its customers while maintaining a strong presence in the storage controller market.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Helmerich &amp; Payne's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Helmerich &amp; Payne is:15% = US$401m ÷ US$2.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Helmerich &amp; Payne's Earnings Growth And 15% ROETo begin with, Helmerich &amp; Payne seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne's net income shrunk at a rate of 5.6% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Helmerich &amp; Payne's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 15% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is HP worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether HP is currently mispriced by the market.Is Helmerich &amp; Payne Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Looking at its LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 26% (or a retention ratio of 74%) which is pretty normal, Helmerich &amp; Payne's declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Helmerich &amp; Payne has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 23% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 13%.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Helmerich &amp; Payne has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up 3.07% in July and nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ-100 indices are up 7.1% and 45.1% year-to-date, respectively.Several factors, including major breakthroughs in the Artificial Intelligence arena, a pause in interest rate hikes, better than expected inflation results, and resilient economic growth. The latest economic data shows that the United States economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% in Q2 2023, nearly a full percentage point more than consensus estimates.After a streak of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the period of 14 months by the United States Federal Reserve, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in its June meeting.

This marks the benchmark rate at its highest level since 2001.The comments of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a press conference generated mixed results for the equities markets. Even though policymakers indicated the possibility of two rate hikes by the end of the year, in their June meeting, Powell’s comments have raised hopes for just the one interest rate hike this year. The Fed Chairman affirmed that the central bank intends to make data-driven decisions concerning any further rate hikes on a “meeting-by-meeting” basis.Jerome Powell said in his press conference on July 26:Story continues“I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted. And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.”The S&amp;P 500 index is highly concentrated this year, with the highest weightage of the five largest holdings since 1990.

And although attacker tools are evolving, social engineering continues to be the leading tactic used to breach corporate networks,"" said Noopur Davis, Executive Vice President, Chief Information Security and Product Privacy Officer, Comcast Corporation and Comcast Cable. ""CISOs and CIOs have to adjust to the evolving threat landscape to protect their organizations and customers.""The report leverages data from 23.5 billion cybersecurity attacks, spanning 500 threat types and 900 distinct infrastructure and software vulnerabilities, that Comcast Business helped customers navigate in 2022 and sheds light on the new threat matrix and strategies adversaries employ to access enterprise networks. Key themes from this year’s report include:The majority of breaches now originate with the users of internal and external resources. Cyber-attacks used to begin with an exploit of a vulnerability in public-facing network resources that connect to applications and infrastructure within the network perimeter. Research has shown that today, approximately 67% of all breaches start with someone clicking on a seemingly safe link, which explains why adversaries begin 80-95% of all attacks with a phish.Adversaries' use of reconnaissance tactics underscores the importance of only accepting network connection requests from trusted sources. Attackers do their homework to uncover vulnerabilities, like open ports and misconfigured systems, as evidenced by the 242 million reconnaissance scans of customer networks and assets. The top reconnaissance tools employed by adversaries include vulnerability scanners, botnets and phishing. Once inside a network, adversaries made 2.6 million attempts to modify or create new firewall rules to establish external communications for command-and-control operations and data exfiltration.Story continuesRemote desktop has become an increasingly targeted vulnerability. Adversaries used various methods, including remote desktop, theft and brute force attacks to steal credentials and gain unauthorized access to customer networks. Customer logs documented over 54 million attempts to exploit credentials for initial access. Additionally, bad actors capitalized on vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations, resulting in over 185 million attempts to gain remote access. Unauthenticated users also exploited vulnerabilities in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and made 139 million attempts to establish connections to victim servers. Furthermore, credential-stealing malware contributed to 159 million attempts by adversaries to steal and use credentials to infiltrate compromised networks.Adversaries continue to exploit the Apache Log4j vulnerability. The Apache Log4j vulnerability remains a significant threat due to the widespread deployment of millions of Java applications, leaving a staggering 72% of organizations vulnerable to exploits. Comcast Business prevented nearly 105 million Log4j exploit attempts in 2022. By regularly updating systems and optimizing operating performance, businesses can fortify their endpoints against potential cyber-attacks and mitigate the risks associated with Log4j exploits.Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks will continue to be a concern as the world becomes more interconnected. Comcast Business detected 51,915 DDoS attacks in 2022. IT and technical service customers saw an increase in DDos attempts, making up 25% of attempts, joining education (46%), finance (14%) and healthcare (13%) as the most targeted industry segments. These attacks aimed to disrupt critical database servers and network resources, with over 210 million instances of denial-of-service attacks recorded.""No organization has perfect security, but everyone needs to understand their cybersecurity risks and build a plan to address the threats and trends the industry is experiencing,"" said Shena Seneca Tharnish, Vice President, Secure Networking and Cyber Security Solutions.

However, an active catastrophe environment and continued inflationary pressures are likely to have dampened growth prospects for insurers. Some of the insurers, including The Allstate Corporation ALL, Aflac Incorporated AFL, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial, Inc. PRU and Unum Group UNM, are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Aug 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for second-quarter 2023 are anticipated to rise 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. These companies’ revenues are anticipated to improve 7.4% year over year.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q2Revenues of insurance companies are likely to have benefited from an expanding premium base, which resulted from continued rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the second quarter. Growing premiums bode well for insurers as they account for a significant chunk to their top line.The commercial property insurance rates in the United States witnessed an increase of 10.7% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, MarketScout. According to the same source, rate increases in general liability and inland marine insurance lines registered rate increases of 7% and 5%, respectively, in the second quarter. A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue an M&amp;A strategy to build diversified portfolios, which is likely to have minimized concentration risks and boosted the sale of insurance policies in the second quarter. Higher policy sales might fetch higher premiums to insurers.Story continuesHowever, an active catastrophe environment is expected to have created roadblocks for insurers’ underwriting results in the to-be-reported quarter. Per JP Morgan analysts, insured losses from major natural catastrophes are likely to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter, with the majority of such losses stemming from storms in June. Despite its associated share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. Insurers are also equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses.For insurers having exposure to rate-sensitive products, an improved interest rate environment is expected to have boosted their investment yields in the second quarter. An aging U.S. population might have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers, fetching steady premium flows.A higher number of cars plying on roads as a result of receding pandemic effects is likely to have boosted auto premiums of insurers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, persistent inflationary headwinds and uninterrupted claim expenses might have exerted strain on the profits of auto insurers.The resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing is expected to have provided an impetus to the demand for worker compensation insurance coverage in the second quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in light of a booming digital era, which are expected to have accelerated claim payments and automated processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the second quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

Growing market-based investment income are expected to have aided quarterly results. However, elevated loss costs resulting from persistent inflationary pressure and the continued incidence of catastrophe losses might have hurt the performance of Allstate in the second quarter.

(NYSE:URI) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.74bUS$2.86bUS$3.07bUS$2.66bUS$2.67bUS$2.70bUS$2.74bUS$2.78bUS$2.83bUS$2.88bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 0.56%Est @ 1.02%Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.58%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.85% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.1%) = US$39bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$33b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$446, the company appears about fair value at a 6.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Rentals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.283. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United RentalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Trade Distributors market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

336,62ea6ed3-2e5e-347e-8b0a-71410c4d6c0d,ORCL,2023-08-01,11 Most Advanced AI Companies,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-advanced-ai-companies-194419641.html,1690832659,STORY,"['AI', 'SNOW', 'ORCL', 'IBM', 'PLTR', 'MSFT', 'PATH', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 most advanced AI companies. To skip our detailed analysis of current trends in the artificial intelligence sector, you can take a look at the 5 Most Advanced AI Companies.Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the markets can talk about these days and for good reason. This form of technology has managed to revolutionize the tech industry in a shockingly short period of time, making every major tech company out there think that the AI space is where they have to be in 2023. Companies across a whole range of fields are quickly making AI investments their top priority, as several surveys conducted this year have shown.AI Investments On The RiseOne such survey is the CNBC Technology Executive Council survey, the results of which were announced on June 23. The survey asked companies about which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months. Options in the answer included AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Of the companies answering the survey, 47.37% said that AI would be their top choice, while 21.05% and 10.53% voted for cloud computing and IoT, respectively. Based on this survey, it can be said that the AI boom will continue to dominate the tech narrative over the foreseeable future just as much as it has been dominating this year. The survey also revealed that 58% of the voting companies saw AI as a critical tech strategy they will be implementing over the next 12 months. Additionally, 53% of the respondents noted that machine learning (ML) will be their critical tech strategy over the same period. Finally, when it comes to AI spending, 63% of the respondents noted that they are accelerating their investments in this technology, 37% of the respondents noted that they are proceeding with caution when it comes to AI spending, and no respondent said that they are not investing in AI.These statistics highlight just how widespread and pervasive the current AI buzz really is. This bodes well for companies massively invested in this space, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). A look at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent disclosure of its AI chatbot Co-Pilot's subscription fees shows just how much these companies are banking on AI today. The subscription fee was announced at $30 per month, and according to CNBC on July 25, the potential market for this product is ""huge."" This is unsurprising considering the fact that ""hundreds of millions"" of Microsoft 365 users are currently making up the potential user base for this new subscription. Additionally, analysts are expected segments like the Azure Cloud business to also help Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) benefit from the AI boom. This segment has seen slowing growth recently, but in light of the company's active involvement in the AI space, analysts now forecast a growth of 25% for Azure Cloud in the latest quarter.Story continuesThese are just some of the exciting developments brewing in the tech and AI space this year. There's much more to keep an eye on if you are looking to buy into the AI boom in the hopes of benefitting from it in the long run. Considering the vast range of possibilities presented by AI this year, we have compiled a list of some of the most advanced AI companies in the market today. These include the biggest AI companies in the world alongside several emerging AI companies that have been innovating in this space.Most Advanced AI CompaniesPhoto by Maximalfocus on UnsplashOur MethodologyUsing a consensus-based approach by consulting several sources online, we have selected AI companies that have been making innovative moves in the sector this year. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest. We used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter to rank them.Most Advanced AI Companies11. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company. It is based in Redwood City, California. The company's platform provides an application development and runtime environment enabling customers to design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI applications. Its new product, C3 Generative AI for Enterprise Search, gives enterprise users access to generative AI tech in data management and more.Joe Goodwin, an analyst at JMP Securities, maintains an Outperform rating on shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of July 24. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $38 to $40.There were 24 hedge funds long C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $151.9 million.Here's what Kerrisdale Capital said about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its March 2023 investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA),  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is a highly innovative AI company.10. Palantir Technologies Inc.

The company’s base business is benefitting from a number of secular tailwinds, the three most prevalent being: 1) data-driven decision making, 2) cloud adoption, and 3) the exponential growth of corporate data. The company’s visionary management team, headed by industry veteran Frank Slootman, plans to capture its fair share of this growth through: 1) executing on its land and expand model, 2) acquiring new customers, 3) growing internationally, and 4) expanding its nascent partner network. The stock’s negative contribution in the quarter was due to the timing of Ithaka’s purchase (mid-February) and its small portfolio weighting (100bps).”6.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result.

The solution helps make security compliance and cloud adoption for mission-critical workloads easier, faster, and more cost effective by using a framework of cloud native services.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)SCCA is a DoD security framework designed to provide a standard approach for boundary and application-level security for the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Impact Level 4 and 5 data hosted in commercial cloud environments. Historically, SCCA compliance has required significant investment from DoD mission owners in the form of independent development efforts and third-party software licensing. The cost and time result in a significant challenge during cloud migrations.Oracle Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone provides a framework for securely running DoD mission workloads and storing Impact Level 2, 4, and 5 data in OCI government regions. The automation provided by the solution enables DoD mission owners to establish a compliant security architecture in just a few hours or days, instead of months. It uses cloud native infrastructure services, significantly accelerating the time to deployment of mission critical workloads by reducing architecture time and minimizing decision points.""Oracle Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone is a game changer for our customers. What we are doing is fundamentally different,""said Rand Waldron, vice president, OCI Global Government Sector. ""We will deliver all the capabilities necessary for SCCA completely in native OCI services. Our customers will no longer have to manage multiple licenses, multiple vendor relationships, or multiple kinds of security configurations. Our SCCA solution will provide everything the customer needs to stand up an SCCA-compliant workload in the cloud."".Story continuesLearn more about Oracle's new Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone solution in the OCI SCCA Architecture Guide.Simplifying and accelerating DoD security complianceThe Oracle Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone includes baseline configurations, rules, and templates that meet DISA Impact Level 2, 4 and 5 accreditation requirements. This is delivered using a standardized Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) template that meets a set of SCCA controls in a simplified and repeatable way. Based on Terraform, OCI Landing Zones allow OCI customers to perform one click, best-practice deployments of multiple Oracle services at once. Customers can launch the templates from the Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone, answer a few simple questions about their configuration, and have an architecture set up same day.The solution also addresses the four primary technical components of the SCCA framework; Cloud Access Point (CAP), Virtual Data Center Security Stack (VDSS), Virtual Data Center Management Service (VDMS), and Trusted Cloud Credential Manager (TCCM). Customers who deploy the secure baseline using the Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone are provided with an architecture guide, implementation guide, requirements checklist, reference architecture, and best practices to accelerate the accreditation of their application on OCI.Security, compliance, consistent high performance, and simple, predictable pricingThe Oracle Cloud Native SCCA Landing Zone script and associated technical documentation are provided at no separate or additional charge under a customer's contract. Underlying consumable cloud services used to stand up Oracle Cloud Native SCCA in a customer's tenancy may be billable in accordance with the customer's contract. Oracle Cloud for DoD services are priced at the same, consistent global pricing as Oracle's commercial public cloud regions and meet DISA Impact Levels 2, 4, and 5 and FedRAMP+ authorization standards.Commercial customers can also take advantage of the automated security posture outlined above. All OCI customers can leverage custom security zones with the SCCA and other OCI Landing Zones that allow organizations to apply security policies and prevent changes that could weaken a customer's security configuration quickly and easily.

338,106e1c0b-6d76-3d5c-8fb4-26e094c2b8e2,PSA,2023-08-01,What's in Store for Public Storage (PSA) in Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-public-storage-psa-145200960.html,1690815120,STORY,"['PSA', 'VTR', 'COLD']","[Public Storage PSA is slated to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2 after market close. Both its quarterly revenues and core funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have witnessed year-over-year increases.In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 0.25% in terms of core FFO per share. Results reflected a better-than-anticipated top line. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions.Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 2.07%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Public Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage Price and EPS SurprisePublic Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key FactorsPublic Storage is likely to have gained from its solid presence in key cities and high brand value in the second quarter. PSA is also likely to have benefited from its technological advantage amid favorable market fundamentals and maintained a healthy balance sheet position.The company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. From the beginning of 2021 through Mar 31, 2023, Public Storage acquired 311 facilities, with 27 million net rentable square feet, for $5.9 billion. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration. Moreover, following Mar 31, 2023, PSA acquired or was under contract to buy 12 self-storage facilities spanning 0.9 million net rentable square feet of space across three states for $139 million.Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported. Also, PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.However, with tenants reverting to more normal move-out behavior as the pandemic’s impact abates, there is upward pressure on vacate trends. Furthermore, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition. We estimate weighted average square foot occupancy to decline to 93.1% from 93.2% reported in the prior quarter.Also, rising interest rates add to its woes. We estimate a 34.5% year-over-year increase in interest expenses.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.12 billion. This calls for an 8.33% year-over-year increase.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.05 billion. This suggests an increase from the $973.29 million witnessed in the year-ago period. Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $62.57 million, ahead of the $58.76 million registered in the comparable period last year.PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter core FFO per share has been unrevised at $4.20 in the past two months. However, it calls for 5.26% year-over-year growth.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Public Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.PSA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.07%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks That Warrant a LookOur model shows that Ventas VTR and Americold Realty Trust COLD have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Ventas is slated to report quarterly numbers on Aug 3.

So he sued.In a proposed class action filed on Monday in Brooklyn federal court, Siragusa accused Taco Bell of deceiving consumers by falsely advertising its Mexican Pizza, Veggie Mexican Pizza, Crunchwrap Supreme, Grande Crunchwrap and Vegan Crunchwrap as containing ""at least double"" their actual content.Siragusa, of Ridgewood, New York, included photos showing food bursting with beef, cheese and bright red and green vegetables, juxtaposed with ""actual"" photos of smaller, less vibrant food that other customers posted online.Taco Bell ads are ""unfair and financially damaging to consumers,"" and ""especially concerning now that inflation, food, and meat prices are very high and many consumers, especially lower income consumers, are struggling financially,"" the complaint said.The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million for Taco Bell customers who bought the five items in New York state in the last three years. He is not alleging that the items contain less content than Taco Bell describes on its website.Taco Bell, a unit of Yum Brands, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Last year, one of Siragusa's lawyers filed a still-pending lawsuit in Brooklyn accusing McDonald's and Wendy's over the actual versus advertised size of their burgers.The other lawyer, Anthony Russo, filed a similar case last year in Miami against Burger King over its Whoppers. That lawsuit went to mediation, where it reached an impasse.""Taco Bell does not adequately disclose the weight of the beef or filling,"" Russo said in an email. ""Plaintiff did not make any purchases of the product based on any weight disclosure but solely based on the picture of the product, as we believe most consumers do.""The case is Siragusa v Taco Bell Corp, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 23-05748.

345,36656fd6-aec4-31ed-ae27-025ae4c1841a,AON,2023-08-01,16 High-Paying Jobs for Retired Law Enforcement Officers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-high-paying-jobs-retired-172821260.html,1690824501,STORY,"['FTNT', 'AON']","[In this article, we will look at the 16 high-paying jobs for retired law enforcement officers. We have also discussed some interesting insights about the current employment in the government sector and for law enforcement officers in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 High-Paying Jobs for Retired Law Enforcement Officers. Retiring from a long and distinguished career in law enforcement is an important milestone for many officers who have dedicated their lives to protecting and serving their communities. However, for those looking to continue their professional journey beyond retirement, the question of ""What's next?"" looms large. Moreover, some may also be observed to be leaving law enforcement for a new career path.However, for the United States, there are still challenges that need to be discussed first. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city with a population of 411,000 and a violent crime rate twice the national average, police officials are faced with the critical challenge of filling 160 vacant officer positions. The shortage of officers is also evident in other major cities across America, and city leaders and police chiefs often attribute this to the ""toxic"" national dialogue that has demonized police officers, particularly after the death of George Floyd in May 2020. The public expressions of distrust and protests against police have made recruitment difficult for law enforcement agencies. It also then explains why the job of police officers is one of the least trusted professions in America.However, the issue goes beyond just police departments. Recruiters are finding it hard to fill other government positions such as firefighters and bus drivers as well. Employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau reveals a steady decline in both law enforcement and local government jobs during the pandemic. From March 2020 to August 2022, government workers decreased by 5%, and local law enforcement employees decreased by 4%.Story continuesDespite the prevalent belief that anti-police sentiment is driving officers away, experts suggest that officers are leaving for better opportunities in the private sector, despite having one of the jobs that still offer traditional pensions. The allure of higher pay and more flexibility in starting their own businesses or working remotely has enticed some officers to switch careers. This trend has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a surge in early retirements across various professions, including the police. To read more about remote jobs, you can read our article about the best work-from-home jobs for 2023.The decrease in police employment has been more pronounced in cities with over 1 million residents, like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, where the number of sworn officers dropped twice as fast as the national average. The pandemic also influenced the overall migration of the workforce from expensive urban areas to smaller cities, where remote work was more feasible and cost of living and average salaries were more favorable.In response to the staffing shortages, some cities are offering signing bonuses to attract police officers and firefighters. However, the overall trend of declining government jobs, including law enforcement, raises concerns about critical labor shortages in various sectors. It is worth noting that law enforcement jobs can aslo be highly paid. For example, one of the highest-paid law enforcement positions is of a general counselor with an average annual salary of $126,283.While the political and social landscape may contribute to officer burnout, the long-term impact of early retirements and an aging workforce, referred to as the ""silver tsunami,"" presents a broader challenge for recruitment and retention in government jobs.On the other hand, in a recent report, it has been revealed that 77 retired senior U.S. military officials, including Generals and Admirals, have been engaged in high-paying jobs for foreign governments since 2012. These countries include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Charles Grassley obtained this information from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the top country of employment for these officers was the UAE, with over half of the approvals for work being with the Emirates.While some may be surprised by the scale of this trend, it raises questions about the motivations behind these arrangements. The report highlights that certain retired officers gained approval to work for multiple foreign governments simultaneously which also raises concerns about their influence and connections back in Washington.Now, coming to the career paths for former or retired law enforcement officers, we have found an interesting trend. With the emergence of cyber security, risk management, and corporate consulting, these industries have been highly promising and sought-after for retired law enforcement officers. They are believed to have personally fulfilling and financially rewarding prospects for those willing to step out beyond law enforcement.The two giants associated with the industries of cyber security and risk management are Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) and Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) respectively. They not only offer promising careers in the field owing to their world-class work culture but have some of the highest salaries in the country.

Similarly, while the average salary for a risk manager is $100,002 in the US, the expected salary for a risk manager at Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) stands at $147,973.16 High-Paying Jobs for Retired Law Enforcement OfficersDen Rise/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo list the high-paying jobs for retired law enforcement officers, we conducted extensive research on Reddit threads about the various career options these officers pursue.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the fast food and quick service restaurant sector, you can go directly to the 5 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America.Over the past few decades, fast food has become an important part of life in the United States. Not surprisingly, the fast food and quick service restaurant business is extremely competitive today. People are always looking for food that is inexpensive, appealing, full of taste, and fast.A number of fast food chains and quick service restaurants in America have become institutions over the years. With new competition, sometimes the old players are pushed out. And sometimes the new ones don’t really have what it takes to make it in the fast and competitive fast food industry. In this article, we will be looking at 12 fast food restaurant chains in the US that have the highest number of restaurant locations closures, but first let’s take a look at the fast food and quick service restaurant industry.The Fast Food and Quick Service Restaurant Industry to Reach $320 BillionPreviously, the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 led to some of the biggest restaurant chains to file for bankruptcies in 2020. Food delivery services and online ordering helped some of the biggest fast food companies stay alive during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In one of our previous articles, 25 Most Valuable Food Companies in The World, we also discussed briefly how the food industry is currently facing challenges with regards to food safety concerns. However, we mentioned that the continuously growing global population remains one of the key drivers of growth in the food and restaurant industry.According to Research and Markets, the global fast food and quick service restaurant market was valued at $243.9 billion in the year 2022. The highly competitive market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during 2023-2028, reaching $319.7 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Inclination of consumers, mainly millennials, towards fast food items and ready-to-eat meals is one of the biggest factors that is expected to help the market to flourish in the coming years. The increasing working population and their hectic schedules have significantly heightened the consumption of fast food in a number of countries around the world. The demand for fast food and quick service items is on the rise, and this remains one of the key factors creating a more positive outlook for the market. In addition to this, factors such as digitization and modernization of the restaurant outlets, combined with the utilization of digital sales terminals and touchscreen kiosks, are expected to further augment market growth.Story continuesSome restaurant and food company stocks that are expected to become a popular choice during this period include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).While the global food and restaurant industry was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis, signs of recovery continue to create a positive outlook for the market as some of the biggest names in the industry shift their focus towards growth. On March 6, Reuters reported that Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will be looking to open as many as 100 new outlets in the UK. The corporation is reportedly on track to invest GBP 30 million in their UK operations for the launch of new locations as well as renovation of their more than 1000 already existing outlets.With regards to the market in China, here are some comments from Starbucks Corporation’s (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Moving on to China. Q2 marked a significant turning point when we finally began to emerge from 3 years of unprecedented COVID disruptions, embarking on the recovery journey that we have envisioned. We saw a robust recovery in Q2, reinforcing the resilience of our partners, the strength of our brand and the close relationships that we have built with our customers.We experienced faster-than-expected recovery, closing the quarter with nearly $800 million in revenue, up 3% from the prior year and up 11%, excluding the 8% impact of foreign currency translation. Comp growth of 3% marked the first positive comp since the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.Importantly, we accelerated our store development in the quarter, opening 153 net new stores, more than doubling the net new stores in the previous quarter. We now operate over 6,200 stores across 244 cities, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 9,000 stores by 2025. Our bold decision to continue opening new stores over the past 3 years, despite COVID disruptions and mobility restrictions, is paying off as they continue to deliver returns and profitability.”However, global inflation and rising food prices has caused problems for some of the top contenders in the fast food industry. Despite being one of the biggest fast food companies in the world, Subway had to close more than a thousand of their locations in the US in recent years. On May 1, Reuters published an article that claimed that the Subway chain of restaurants declined by 2.7% in the US due to closures in 2022.On the other hand, on July 24, Reuters posted that restaurant chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) are set to report strong earnings in the fiscal second half of this year as the prices of commodities such as chicken and dairy have eased. The post also claims that data from Placer.ai showed that visits to McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) increased by 8.4% in the second quarter, while visits to Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) rose by 15.7%.On July 27, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.17, beating the EPS estimates by $0.38. The company reported a revenue of $6.5 billion and surpassed revenue estimates by $202.69 million.12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In AmericaCopyright: bhofack2 / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor this list, we ranked the 12 worst performing fast food chains in America based on location closures and the loss of restaurant locations since 2018.

You can skip our detailed analysis on food preferences Americans have for their breakfast meal, and head over directly to the 5 Most Popular Breakfast Foods in America.Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It helps break the overnight fasting food, boosts your energy and concentration levels to kick start the day, and provides essential nutrients that are vital for good health. According to medical experts, those who do not have regular breakfast can be at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, compared to people who ensure they have their breakfast every morning. Based on our findings, pancakes, bacon and eggs, avocado toast, and cereal are the most popular breakfast foods in America. Other dishes commonly eaten to start off the day typically include sausages, waffles, french toast, and sandwiches to name a few. An online survey commissioned by General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) Foodservice in 2021 revealed the affection Americans have for breakfast. 62% of them termed it as their favorite meal of the day, and 56% of the respondents say they love breakfast more now than they did in the previous year. Nearly 80% of those surveyed had eaten breakfast foods in other meals during the day, including for lunch and dinner. 20% of them even ate sweet breakfast items as dessert. In addition to this, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 82.4% of children aged between 2 and 19 eat breakfast daily. The results of these surveys indicate the growing popularity of the meal in the United States. This is an improvement from a study conducted by the Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) in 2011 which they stated that only 34% of Americans have breakfast, and 40% of the moms reported their kids do not have breakfast daily. Globally, the breakfast food industry was valued at just over $398 billion in 2020, according to Allied Market Research, and is projected to grow to $729.5 billion by 2030. North America holds a major chunk of this share due to a rise in adoption of healthy lifestyle. However, the Asia-Pacific market is likely to be the fastest growing breakfast food market between 2020 and 2030.Story continuesKellogg Company (NYSE:K) is the leading producer of convenience breakfast foods in America. It is the market leader in the global cereals industry and the maker of Corn Flakes and Froot Loops. Corn Flakes as a cereal have become so popular in the United States and around the world that cereal and Corn Flakes often seem synonymous and are used interchangeably. Kellogg Company (NYSE:K)’s food products are manufactured and marketed in around 180 countries of the world. In 2022, Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) generated net sales of $15.3 billion, driven mainly by sales of cereals and convenience snacks.General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) is another prominent company that manufactures and markets food products in America, including items that are commonly had for breakfast. Some of its popular breakfast products include Cheerios, Lucky Charms, Chex, and Trix. General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) recorded $3.5 billion in operating profits in 2022, an increase of 2% from the previous year. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of America's favorite breakfast spots. Results from a poll held in 2015 that received over 10,000 responses showed that 43% of Americans didn’t have breakfast at home and got something on the go. Among them, 31% grabbed food from a nearby gas station, while 46% headed to the drive-thru of a restaurant. Of those who went to the restaurant, 44% preferred McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) as their go-to place for breakfast. Some breakfast food items offered by McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin, Bacon, Egg &amp; Cheese Biscuit, Hotcakes, Sausage Burritos, Hash Browns, and more. MethodologyThe 16 most popular breakfast foods in America have been ranked using consensus methodology, in which we considered listings of preferred breakfast foods in America on five websites – USA Today, Colony Diner, Taste Atlas, FreshersLive, and The Top Tens – and then assigned aggregated scores to each food item based on its ranking on these websites.

360,d3c8be05-cbb0-381f-b2ba-5875d472895a,AXP,2023-08-01,American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 65%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-nyse-axp-110112797.html,1690887672,STORY,['AXP'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies American Express' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 12 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyTo get a sense of who is truly in control of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at American Express' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of American Express Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$170m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 21% of American Express stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The combination capitalizes on GMED’s complementary commercial organization and should allow the company to accelerate its globalization strategies to increase customer reach and strengthen surgeon relationships.A strong solvency position is an added positive.Story continuesOn the flip side, related to the antitrust approval on the company’s planned merger with NuVasive, both the companies recently received an SEC request from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission regarding the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) filing. As a result, the expected close of the merger has been delayed from mid-2023 to the third quarter of 2023.Meanwhile, escalating expenses are putting pressure on the operating margin. SG&amp;A expenses in the reported quarter were up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by sales compensation, as well as higher meetings, travel and training expenses. In consequence, the adjusted operating margin contracted 55 bps in the quarter to 22.5%. Further, stiff competition and pricing pressure continue to pose challenges.Further, the musculoskeletal devices industry is characterized by intensifying competitive pricing pressure. Pricing continues to remain a major headwind for Globus Medical. We remain concerned about the pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost containment efforts by governmental healthcare, local hospitals and health systems.Further, the musculoskeletal devices industry faces intense competition as well as challenges of third-party coverage and reimbursement practices. Management believes that there will be continued pricing pressure in the future. If competitive forces drive down the prices the company charges for its products, its profit margins will shrink, thus affecting Globus Medical’s ability to maintain its profitability and invest in growing its business.Over the past year, shares of Globus Medical have underperformed its industry. The stock has rallied 5.9% compared with the 6.6% rise of the industry.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Haemonetics HAE and McKesson MCK.Zimmer Biomet has an earnings yield of 5.35% compared to the industry’s -3.65%.

ZBH, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zimmer Biomet is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZBH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.86 per share for ZBH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 per share.

371,316991ed-c028-3c60-929d-7917409b5664,ZBH,2023-08-01,Here's Why You Should Retain Bruker (BRKR) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-bruker-brkr-125100331.html,1690807860,STORY,"['BRKR', 'ZBH', 'MCK', 'HAE']","[Bruker Corporation BRKR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the robust growth of its BioSpin Group across its full portfolio. In the last reported quarter, CALID group’s organic revenues increased in the low 20%, along with very strong bookings of the timsTOF platform. Bruker NANO's academic, industrial and GreenTech Research and high-end semiconductor metrology revenues remained strong. However, competitive space and foreign currency fluctuations are worrisome for BRKR.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 0.1% against the 10.2% fall of the industry and an 11.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $10.14 billion. Bruker projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 18.2% compared with 13% of the industry. BRKR’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters and was break even in one, delivering an average surprise of 10.9%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrong Prospects of BioSpin: In the first quarter of 2023, BioSpin Group’s revenues grew in the high-teens percentage on a constant-currency basis despite any gigahertz-class revenues in the first quarter. BioSpin saw robust growth in revenues across its full portfolio, including NMR and MRI preclinical imaging.Meanwhile, Bruker received two orders for 1.2 gigahertz NMRs in the first quarter, which will be placed at the University of Warwick and the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.  The systems are used for structural and functional biology and life-science research, GreenTech and materials research. With both institutions already having Bruker 1.0 GHz NMR spectrometer, the latest move highlights the expansion of fundamental research infrastructure in the UK.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCALID Group Holds Potential: In the first quarter, the constant-currency revenue growth of Bruker’s CALID Group was supported by strong life science mass spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopy businesses.Story continuesThe timsTOF platform continued its adoption in 4D proteomics, epiproteomics and multiomics. The company had excellent year-over-year growth in bookings and announced further key enhancements to advance capabilities.BSI Nano Group’s Prospects Look Bright: In the first quarter, Bruker Nano’s revenues grew in the low 20% on a constant-currency basis. NANO's academic, industrial and GreenTech Research and high-end semiconductor metrology revenues remained strong. Revenues for advanced X-ray and Nano Surfaces tools also delivered strong growth in the quarter.Further, NANO's microelectronics and semiconductor metrology tools performed well with strong bookings and backlogs.DownsidesA Competitive Landscape: Bruker faces substantial competition in a consolidating industry and expects the competition across its markets to increase further. Bruker BioSpin competes with companies that offer magnetic resonance spectrometers, mainly JEOL and Oxford Instruments. In the field of preclinical imaging, Bruker BioSpin faces a competitive threat from Perkin Elmer, Visualsonics (Fuji Film) and others.Unfortunately, many of Bruker’s peers have expanded their market share in recent years through business combinations. Other companies may also choose to enter Bruker’s fields of operation in the near future.Exposed to Currency Movements: Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses at the company. In addition, this could cause the price of Bruker’s products to be less competitive than its principal competitors' offerings.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bruker’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $2.58 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.86 billion.

372,4e169716-6996-31d8-9b15-dc40d7fb6ff0,ZBH,2023-08-01,4 Medical Product Stocks to Buy Amid Recovering Prospects,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-medical-product-stocks-buy-124600650.html,1690807560,STORY,"['HAE', 'ZBH', '^GSPC', 'ABT', 'SYK']","[The medical sector and other global economies are facing macroeconomic challenges such as supply-chain constraints, increased material costs and shortage of workers after the pandemic crisis. Despite the revenue recovery in the first half of 2023, following gradual economic reopening in 2022, the margins were affected by these headwinds. The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. Revenues are expected to grow from introduction of new products and expansion into new markets. Some medical procedures related to heart rhythm, heart surgery, brain blood vessels and blood sugar have a high demand trend, which buoys optimism. Although the weakness in the industry’s bottom line is likely to continue in the second half of 2023, the impact of rising costs is likely to alleviate as the year progresses. The industry players are increasing prices of their products and services, which is helping offset the impact of rising costs and expenses. The demand for medical products is also improving steadily in Europe and other markets. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, the declining demand for COVID-19 related products continues to hurt revenues.Meanwhile, industry players like Abbott Laboratories ABT, Stryker SYK, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and Haemonetics HAE have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their share prices.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting their top-line growth. Lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply-chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures, along with cost-cutting initiatives, is likely to drive the industry’s performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

The Diabetes Care business, a part of Medical devices segment, continued to benefit from the growing sales of its sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. However, the top line in the first quarter reflected unfavorable year-over-year comparison due to high demand for COVID-related products and services in 2022.

Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume.

It is why we have made sustainability the fourth pillar of our long-term business strategy, Vision 2030, alongside growth, execution, and culture.As a global snacking leader, our ambition is to make snacking right in a world facing many different challenges, including climate change, nature-loss, worker welfare, and plastic waste, among others. To take on these challenges and deliver our sustainable growth ambition, we focus on the issues that are important to us, our consumers, and the world. This intensified and accelerated focus is at the heart of how we intend to achieve our sustainability vision of creating a future where together people and the planet thrive - by leading where we matter most and driving change where the world needs it most.Building on our 2025 public goals, we have bold and targeted long-term ambitions that help us focus, accelerate, and scale our efforts. It is our way of turning the volume up on our aim to lead the future of snacking and make the most of our potential to have a bigger positive impact as we continue to grow.In particular, we are focused on more sustainably-sourced cocoa and wheat, two core ingredients at the heart of our much-loved snacks. Over the first 10 years as a company, we have scaled our signature programs, Cocoa Life and Harmony wheat, helping hundreds of thousands of farmers to build stronger farming businesses and more resilient communities and landscapes. We see reduced or near zero deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life farms in West Africa and we've pioneered innovative financial incentives to help farmers restore forests. Harmony has cultivated biodiversity, specifically millions of bees and butterflies, alongside its wheat fields for many years long before it was on-trend. Looking ahead, we're proud of the recent announcements we've made to further invest in our expanded 2030 ambition for Cocoa Life and Harmony wheat.We are also putting a longer-term focus on working toward net zero carbon and reducing packaging waste by supporting a circular packaging economy. We're capturing the carbon reductions Cocoa Life and Harmony provide as part of our net zero roadmap. On packaging, we moved to an innovative soft plastic using 30% recycled plastic in our Cadbury Dairy Milk wrappers in Australia and the UK.While we are driving change in our own business, we know the challenges are systemic and cannot be solved by any one company alone. Multi-stakeholder coalitions are critical to achieve the systems transformation that is needed. We are actively leading key coalitions and sharing our data and learnings to develop new solutions in collaboration with peer companies.We are also very aware of the criticality of good governance underpinning our ESG work, including the need for transparent disclosures and reporting. As the requirements in this area continue to evolve, we continue to enhance our systems and processes.I hope you find the progress and learnings from this year's Snacking Made Right report informative and inspiring. Above all else, what I am most proud of is the passion and perseverance of my Mondelēz International colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly to deliver these strong results.

If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar. Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere. Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops. Global Sugar Market OverviewAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages. Story continuesThe food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association. While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry.20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar20 Countries That Produce the Most SugarOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available. Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:20. UkraineAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tonsUkraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi. 19. IranAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tonsIran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production. 18. ArgentinaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tonsArgentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.17. South AfricaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tonsSouth Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development. 16. IndonesiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tonsIndonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing. 15. PhilippinesAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tonsIn the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline. 14. ColombiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tonsColombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.13. GuatemalaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tonsGuatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.12. TurkeyAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tonsTurkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap. 11. EgyptAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tonsEgypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.10. FranceAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tonsFrance is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.9. AustraliaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tonsAustralia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production. The nation produced over 4.33 million tons of raw sugar in 2020/2021 and became one of the largest sugar producing countries. Most Australian sugar farms are often located in coastal areas and make use of the tropical climate that is necessary for sugar cane growth. Click to continue reading 8 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar.Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Corn20 Countries That Produce the Most Wheat11 Best Sugar Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"
377,4642cc4f-fb8f-3f2f-bc2e-0967c109fd37,OXY,2023-08-01,Investing in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) three years ago would have delivered you a 321% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-occidental-petroleum-nyse-oxy-120028017.html,1690891228,STORY,['OXY'],"[Generally speaking, investors are inspired to be stock pickers by the potential to find the big winners. You won't get it right every time, but when you do, the returns can be truly splendid. For example, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) share price is up a whopping 314% in the last three years, a handsome return for long term holders. Meanwhile the share price is 1.3% higher than it was a week ago.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Occidental Petroleum became profitable within the last three years. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Occidental Petroleum has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Occidental Petroleum's TSR for the last 3 years was 321%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Occidental Petroleum had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 12%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 2% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We would want clear information suggesting the company will grow, before taking the view that the share price will stabilize. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Occidental and ADNOC and may also evaluate jointly developing one or more UAE-located CO2 sequestration hubs and consider commencing feasibility and pre-front-end engineering and design studies for a 1 million tonne-per-year DAC plant, which together would provide emissions reduction solutions for carbon-intensive industrial emitters and other hard-to-abate sectors within the UAE, including aviation and maritime operations.Through the collaboration, the companies will also consider opportunities to incorporate innovative CO2-based technologies into the UAE. This includes technologies in which Occidental has made investments, such as emissions-free power and sustainable fuels.“We look forward to building on our longstanding partnership with ADNOC as we advance our plans to globally deploy DAC technology and engage partners who are committed to developing carbon solutions at climate-relevant scale,” said Vicki Hollub, Occidental President and CEO. “Partnerships like this one are essential to helping the world reach its climate goals and ensure it has the resources it needs to thrive through the energy transition. We look forward to working with ADNOC on our shared vision of establishing a global net-zero ecosystem.”Story continuesThe agreement is enabled by the UAE-U.S. Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and is expected to mobilize $100 billion in clean energy and carbon management projects, including CCS and DAC by 2035.Amos Hochstein, White House Senior Advisor to the President for Energy and Investment said: “The world is going to need a host of technologies, including DAC and CCUS, to meet our global climate objectives. This important announcement is a great example of what the U.S.- UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) can help enable. I look forward to what this agreement yields.”In January 2023, an expert body was formed to govern PACE, co-chaired by His Excellency Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and ADNOC Managing Director and Group CEO, and Amos Hochstein, White House Senior Advisor to the President for Energy and Investment.Musabbeh Al Kaabi, Executive Director of Low Carbon Solutions and International Growth at ADNOC said: “This agreement highlights how the UAE-U.S. Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy is driving innovative climate technologies to decarbonize the energy sector. The need to significantly reduce carbon emissions to address climate change is clear and urgent and carbon capture is an important technology that can be scaled up to decarbonize across all industries.“ADNOC’s is a pioneer in carbon management, exemplified by our industry leading low-carbon intensity and our operation of Al Reyadah, the region’s first commercial scale carbon capture facility. As ADNOC accelerates its net zero ambition to 2045 and decarbonizes our operations, partnerships like this offer the potential to transform the systems that will be vital to provide the lower-carbon energy the world needs for the energy transition.”1PointFive is currently constructing what is expected to be the world’s largest DAC plant, named STRATOS, in Texas. The facility, which will use technology provided by Canada-based Carbon Engineering, is designed to capture up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year when fully operational. The DAC plant being evaluated by the companies in the UAE, if built, would use the same technology and could be the first megaton-scale facility of its kind outside of the United States.About Occidental Occidental is an international energy company with assets primarily in the United States, the Middle East and North Africa.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company’s business, provide further information about the Company’s results of operations and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.The Company defines non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and fair value changes of derivative asset bifurcated from Series B Senior Secured Notes and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants.For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this earnings release.EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATIONThis earnings release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar. Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere. Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops. Global Sugar Market OverviewAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages. Story continuesThe food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association. While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry.20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar20 Countries That Produce the Most SugarOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available. Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:20. UkraineAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tonsUkraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi. 19. IranAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tonsIran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production. 18. ArgentinaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tonsArgentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.17. South AfricaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tonsSouth Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development. 16. IndonesiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tonsIndonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing. 15. PhilippinesAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tonsIn the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline. 14. ColombiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tonsColombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.13. GuatemalaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tonsGuatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.12. TurkeyAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tonsTurkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap. 11. EgyptAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tonsEgypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.10. FranceAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tonsFrance is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.9. AustraliaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tonsAustralia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Management believes that Non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Incyte’s GAAP disclosures. Management uses such information internally and externally for establishing budgets, operating goals and financial planning purposes. These metrics are also used to manage the Company’s business and monitor performance. The Company adjusts, where appropriate, for expenses in order to reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations. The metrics have been adopted to align the Company with disclosures provided by industry peers.Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used in conjunction with and to supplement Incyte’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in our industry.As changes in exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, Management believes the presentation of certain revenue results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand its operating results and evaluate its performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current year results using prior year foreign currency exchange rates and generally refers to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as the Company presents them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.Financial HighlightsFinancial Highlights(unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts)Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022Total GAAP revenues$954,610$911,397$1,763,283$1,644,632Total GAAP operating income193,780254,431218,550370,971Total Non-GAAP operating income262,058309,624351,787481,771GAAP net income203,548161,432225,251199,424Non-GAAP net income223,029226,353307,606349,220GAAP basic EPS$0.91$0.73$1.01$0.90Non-GAAP basic EPS$1.00$1.02$1.38$1.58GAAP diluted EPS$0.90$0.72$1.00$0.89Non-GAAP diluted EPS$0.99$1.01$1.36$1.56Revenue DetailsRevenue Details(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended June 30,%Change(as reported)%Change(constantcurrency)1Six Months Ended June 30,%Change(as reported)%Change(constantcurrency)12023202220232022Net product revenues:Jakafi$682,384$597,67314%14%$1,262,353$1,142,13711%11%Opzelura80,23316,560384%384%136,78529,314367%367%Iclusig29,08726,22411%9%56,77252,2939%11%Pemazyre21,57218,98314%14%44,04737,01519%21%Minjuvi13,1594,411198%191%19,7158,913121%122%Zynyz570—NMNM570—NMNMTotal net product revenues827,005663,85125%24%1,520,2421,269,67220%20%Royalty revenues:Jakavi90,44883,7118%10%167,140154,5788%12%Olumiant32,00930,2546%10%66,16478,318(16%)(10%)Tabrecta4,7993,58134%NA8,9767,06427%NAPemazyre349—NMNM761—NMNMTotal royalty revenues127,605117,5469%243,041239,9601%Total net product and royalty revenues954,610781,39722%1,763,2831,509,63217%Milestone and contract revenues—130,000(100%)(100%)—135,000(100%)(100%)Total GAAP revenues$954,610$911,3975%$1,763,283$1,644,6327%NM = not meaningfulNA = not available1 Percentage change in constant currency is calculated using 2022 foreign exchange rates to recalculate 2023 results.Product and Royalty Revenues Product revenues and product and royalty revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 increased 25% and 22%, respectively, over the prior year comparative period, primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net product revenues. The increase in Jakafi net product revenues was primarily driven by growth in patient demand across all indications and inventory level normalizing at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Total Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $80 million, representing a 384% increase year-over-year driven by increased patient demand and expanded coverage. Among other Hematology and Oncology, Minjuvi net product revenues grew 198% driven in part by the recognition of $6 million of previously deferred revenue related to the Early Access Program in France, which ended in June 2023. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Operating ExpensesOperating Expense Summary(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended June 30,%ChangeSix Months Ended June 30,%Change2023202220232022GAAP cost of product revenues$68,326$50,63635%$125,148$93,25034%Non-GAAP cost of product revenues162,15044,57539%112,81981,19439%GAAP research and development400,750347,19615%807,391700,56915%Non-GAAP research and development2367,921319,05915%743,541646,10415%GAAP selling, general and administrative283,929253,27712%599,535462,86130%Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative3263,030235,59512%557,047428,27730%GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration8,3743,313153%14,5709,69550%Non-GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration4———%———%GAAP (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements5(549)2,544(122%)(1,911)7,286(126%)1 Non-GAAP cost of product revenues excludes the amortization of licensed intellectual property for Iclusig relating to the acquisition of the European business of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the cost of stock-based compensation.2 Non-GAAP research and development expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation.3 Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation.4 Non-GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is null.5 Growth rate in GAAP (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements represents a decrease in loss position for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.Cost of product revenues GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of product revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 increased 35% and 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to growth in net product revenues.Research and development expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP research and development expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 increased 15%, compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to continued investment in our late stage development assets.Selling, general and administrative expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 increased 12% compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to expenses related to promotional activities to support the launch of Opzelura for the treatment of vitiligo.Other Financial InformationOperating income GAAP and Non-GAAP operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased 24% and 15%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to lower milestone and contract revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, and increased investment in our late stage development assets and in supporting the launch of Opzelura for the treatment of vitiligo.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.4 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.2023 Financial GuidanceIncyte is tightening its full year 2023 guidance for Jakafi net product revenues as a result of its strong second quarter performance.

(NASDAQ:REPL), a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel portfolio of tumor-directed oncolytic immunotherapies, and Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY), a global biopharmaceutical company, today announced a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement to study RP1, Replimune’s lead product candidate, in combination with INCB99280, Incyte’s small molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230731698519/en/""We are excited to enter into this collaboration with Incyte to explore the use of RP1 prior to surgery as we believe that our tumor-directed oncolytic immunotherapies could have a great impact in the neoadjuvant setting both in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and in other cancer types, given the high rates of complete responses we’ve seen to date, and data indicating RP1 is generally very well tolerated,"" said Robert Coffin, Chief Research and Development Officer of Replimune. ""The unique potential of the RPx platform to induce a patient-specific anti-tumor immune response with an off-the-shelf treatment speaks to the practicality and broad potential utility of the approach, and exploring its use with Incyte’s oral PD-L1 inhibitor has the potential to improve the patient experience further.""""We look forward to collaborating with Replimune on this study evaluating INCB99280 and RP1 in patients with CSCC. Our oral PD-L1 program has shown promising safety and efficacy in early studies thus far, and we look forward to adding to the growing body of evidence for INCB99280 and learning more about its potential to improve clinical outcomes,"" said Lance Leopold, M.D., Group Vice President, Clinical Development Hematology and Oncology, Incyte.Story continuesUnder the terms of the agreement, Incyte will initiate and sponsor the clinical trial of INCB99280 and RP1 in patients with high risk, resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), with the clinical trial expected to initiate in early 2024. Replimune will supply Incyte with RP1 for the study and share equally in the costs of the study.About RP1RP1 is Replimune’s lead oncolytic immunotherapy product candidate and is based on a proprietary new strain of herpes simplex virus engineered for robust tumor selective replication and genetically armed with a fusogenic protein (GALV-GP R-) and GM-CSF, intended to maximize tumor killing potency, the immunogenicity of tumor cell death, and the activation of a systemic anti-tumor immune response.About INCB99280INCB99280 is a potent and selective small molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor, which has demonstrated promising clinical activity and safety in patients with solid tumors. INCB99280 is being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 studies as monotherapy and in combination with other antitumor agents.About ReplimuneReplimune Group, Inc., headquartered in Woburn, MA, was founded in 2015 with the mission to transform cancer treatment by pioneering the development of novel tumor-directed oncolytic immunotherapies. Replimune’s proprietary RPx platform is based on a potent HSV-1 backbone with payloads added to maximize immunogenic cell death and the induction of a systemic anti-tumor immune response. The RPx platform has a unique dual local and systemic mechanism of action (MOA) consisting of direct selective virus-mediated killing of the tumor resulting in the release of tumor derived antigens and altering of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to ignite a strong and durable systemic response. This MOA is expected to be synergistic with most established and experimental cancer treatment modalities, and, with an attractive safety profile the RPx platform has the versatility to be developed alone or combined with a variety of other treatment options.

(INTU),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-intuit-inc-intu-080000061.html,1690876800,STORY,['INTU'],"[Intuit Inc.’s (INTU) portfolio of tax-focused software transformed the company into a Wall Street giant. The firm behind TurboTax and other financial services then spent the covid boom adding to its portfolio and diversifying into email marketing and beyond.INTU shares have surged 30% YTD and they just hit new 52-week highs on July 31. Yet, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs and its growth outlook remains solid and steady, driven by the never-ending need for digital tax help and other various software in our digital-everything world.   Intuit's pitch is simple enough: Software and taxes are here to stay no matter what the future holds.Software Everyone Needs &amp; MoreIntuit might be best known for TurboTax, but it is much more than an online tax company. Intuit sells software geared toward accounting, small business money management, and more, including QuickBooks and Mint.Intuit bought Credit Karma in December 2020 and Mailchimp in November 2021. Alongside TurboTax, accounting, and other financial services, Inuit now provides email marketing, digital-ad services, customer-relationship-management tools, credit scores, and other personal financial services. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit boasts over 100 customers worldwide, and it grew its revenue between 11% and 32% for seven years running—the 32% came in fiscal 2022 (up 24% excluding Mailchimp). INTU has expanded its sales from under $4 billion in fiscal 2013 to $12.73 billion in FY22 (period ended on July 31, 2022).Intuit also managed to post a nice string of big bottom-line growth for an extended period of time. Most recently, the tech firm beat our Q3 FY23 EPS estimate in late May and raised its full-year guidance.Near-Term Outlook Intuit’s FY23 revenue (period ended on July 31) is projected to climb by over 12% to jump from $12.73 billion to $14.30 billion, based on the most recent Zacks data. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 20% YoY to $14.22 a share. INTU’s Q4 sales are set to pop by 9.4% to boost its earnings by 25%.Story continuesPeeking ahead to INTU’s fiscal 2024, the company is projected to post 11% higher revenue and 9% stronger adjusted earnings. Intuit has topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, with only one bottom line miss in the past five years. And its positive earnings revisions help Intuit land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance and Valuation Intuit stock has skyrocketed roughly 2,100% over the last 20 years to blow away the Zacks tech sector’s 515%. INTU also more than doubled the tech space during the trailing decade, soaring 700%. The tax software stock continued its outperformance over the past three years as well, up 64% vs. 35%.The stock’s significant outperformance came even though it has roughly matched the tech space over the last two years, with INTU down around 4%. Intuit has, however, lagged the broader Zacks tech sector so far this year, up 31% vs. 43%. Thankfully, INTU has picked up some momentum recently, surging 13% in the last month to hit new 52-week highs on the last day of July.Despite the climb, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs. Plus, INTU trades solidly above its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. The stock also jumped back above its 50-week moving average earlier this year, following its 2022 tumble and it found support there in early June.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIntuit is hardly a value stock, trading at 50.1X forward 12-month earnings. But this marks a 40% discount to its own 10-year highs. The stock’s PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, also showcases around 40% value vs. its decade-long high at 3.3.Bottom Line Intuit’s balance sheet is solid even though it made two big acquisitions over the last several years. The company also pays a dividend (yielding 0.6% right now) that it has raised by 14% annualized over the last five years. And the company has $2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase program.Wall Street is high on the stock, with 19 of the 22 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Intuit sitting at “Strong Buys.” This makes sense given INTU’s long history of growth in a critical, hard-to-cut-back-on area such as taxes, coupled with its expansion into new areas of business and personal finance software.Intuit is set to release its Q4 and full-year fiscal 2023 financial results on August 24.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

400,4e169716-6996-31d8-9b15-dc40d7fb6ff0,SYK,2023-08-01,4 Medical Product Stocks to Buy Amid Recovering Prospects,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-medical-product-stocks-buy-124600650.html,1690807560,STORY,"['HAE', 'ZBH', '^GSPC', 'ABT', 'SYK']","[The medical sector and other global economies are facing macroeconomic challenges such as supply-chain constraints, increased material costs and shortage of workers after the pandemic crisis. Despite the revenue recovery in the first half of 2023, following gradual economic reopening in 2022, the margins were affected by these headwinds. The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. Revenues are expected to grow from introduction of new products and expansion into new markets. Some medical procedures related to heart rhythm, heart surgery, brain blood vessels and blood sugar have a high demand trend, which buoys optimism. Although the weakness in the industry’s bottom line is likely to continue in the second half of 2023, the impact of rising costs is likely to alleviate as the year progresses. The industry players are increasing prices of their products and services, which is helping offset the impact of rising costs and expenses. The demand for medical products is also improving steadily in Europe and other markets. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, the declining demand for COVID-19 related products continues to hurt revenues.Meanwhile, industry players like Abbott Laboratories ABT, Stryker SYK, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and Haemonetics HAE have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their share prices.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting their top-line growth. Lockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply-chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures, along with cost-cutting initiatives, is likely to drive the industry’s performance going forward.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical product stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 0.8% against the Zacks Medical sector’s decline of 4.4%. The S&amp;P 500 has increased 11.5% in the same time frame.One Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 22.7X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 20.2X and the sector’s 22.9X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.8X and as low as 19.1X, with the median being at 23.7X, as the charts show.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)4 Promising Medical Product StocksAbbott Laboratories: It discovers, develops, manufactures and sells a diversified line of health care products. The company operates through four segments — Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), Medical Devices, Nutrition and Diagnostics.Abbott had an encouraging first-quarter results, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, EPD and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia. The Diabetes Care business, a part of Medical devices segment, continued to benefit from the growing sales of its sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. However, the top line in the first quarter reflected unfavorable year-over-year comparison due to high demand for COVID-related products and services in 2022. Following its strong first-quarter 2023 results, the company expects total revenue growth of at least high-single digits, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales. COVID testing-related sales are expected to be around $1.5 billion in 2023. Adjusted EPS is anticipated in the range of $4.30-$4.50. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).For this Abbott Park, IL-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.71 billion.

The company has three business segments — Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine. It continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial.Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter. Internationally, the company continues to post strong organic growth, highlighted by robust organic growth in Europe and emerging markets. Stryker continues to witness strong demand for its robotic-arm assisted surgery platform, Mako, on the back of its unique features and healthy order book despite financial constraints stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.However, hospital staffing pressures weighed on pockets around the globe, impeding growth. Following its strong first-quarter results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (CER) of 8-9% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected in the band of $10.05-$10.25, up from the prior guidance of $9.85-$10.15. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Each of its geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company’s adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts for business recovery. Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. Following encouraging first-quarter results, the company expects revenues and adjusted earnings to grow 5-6% and 7.4-8.9%, respectively, compared with the 2022 metrics. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2.For this Warsaw, IN-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.34 billion.

The company’s portfolio of integrated devices, information management and consulting services offers blood management solutions for each facet of the blood supply chain, facilitating better clinical outcomes. The robust performance of the Plasma and Hospital business, with continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The expansion of both margins is an added advantage.The company has been witnessing strong growth in Plasma franchise for quite some time. In the global plasma market, Haemonetics holds an approximate 80% equity.  It is currently witnessing plasma market growth above historic rates, driven by an industry striving to double collections by 2025 and the rising demand for plasma-based medicines.

Sempra Energy has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.68%, on average. Factors to NoteIn the second quarter, some parts of Sempra Energy’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures. Such weather patterns are likely to have boosted the electricity demand for cooling purposes among the company’s customers in the summer. This is expected to have boosted revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, strong demand growth at Oncor and increased retail transmission interconnection requests are likely to have benefited Sempra’s second-quarter revenue performance.However, some parts of its service territories experienced extreme weather conditions like tornados accompanied by gusty winds, which might have dampened the smooth flow of electricity among SRE customers. This is likely to have negatively impacted the company’s overall second-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.64 billion. This indicates a 2.6% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.From the cost perspective, tornados might have caused infrastructural damage for Sempra Energy, thereby increasing the company’s operation and maintenance expenses to repair the damage. This might have hurt SRE’s second-quarter bottom line. Also, higher depreciation and interest expenses may have dented second-quarter earnings results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.72 per share. This calls for a 13.1% decline from the prior-year reported figure.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sempra Energy this time.

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is working to develop an international legally binding agreement to address plastic pollution and the INC process is the vehicle used to negotiate and deliver such an agreement.An important outcome of INC 2 was the mandate to prepare a zero draft of the international agreement on plastic pollution before the next INC session this fall. To learn more, click here.As industry representatives, we were in good company with colleagues from Dow, ExxonMobil, Sabic, Braskem, CP Chem and more. Speaking on behalf of our industry, together with the World Plastics Council, we shared our views, and debated options and solutions with INC delegates and other stakeholders from countries around the world.Plastic manufacturers are committed to an ambitious and country-driven approach to help governments meet their goal of eliminating new plastic pollution in the environment. We are an industry in transition, with actions already underway such as recycling innovation and scale up, improving product design and investing in waste management infrastructure, but we recognize the need to move faster.Plastic producers have an important role to play in addressing this issue, and we can be an enabler and partner in creating sustainable solutions to support the development of an effective global plastics agreement.I was inspired by the enthusiasm of all attendees coming from a wide variety of viewpoints with a shared vision to be part of the solution to end plastic pollution. I left Paris optimistic about the future and with these reflections:I hope you enjoyed learning a bit more about how LYB is helping shape solutions and global policy for a better tomorrow. If all goes well, the UN will register and announce an agreement to address new plastic pollution at the end of 2024 or in early 2025, and it will be an agreement we helped influence and can support.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellStory continuesDespite differences of opinion on details, all parties agree plastic pollution is a critical issue and are passionate about taking action to address the problem. Industry leaders are committed to being part of the solution and advocating for what we believe will make an agreement most successful. To read more about our industry positions and ambitions on eliminating plastic pollution, click here. We believe a global agreement should:Focus on ending plastic pollution, not plastic production, because plastic plays a key role in offering solutions for a sustainable tomorrow.Emphasize a bottom-up, country-based approach founded on national action plans recognizing local circumstances rather than a top-down, one-size-fits-all global approach.Address access to waste management, which is also key to a circular economy. Without access to waste collection and environmentally sound management of waste, all types of materials will continue to leak into the environment.De-risk waste management investments to encourage developmental banks and investors to fund basic waste management infrastructure where it is needed most. We have a long way to go and not every country is on the same page with respect to how we address the crisis, but we are listening to each other. As the name implies, the pending zero draft is only a starting point for detailed negotiations and even compromises. The industry will continue to advocate, educate and listen to all perspectives, as we move ahead on this global agreement. The next INC session is in November at the UNEP headquarters in Kenya, and we are already taking the lessons learned from INC 2 to engage successfully during INC 3.LyondellBasell, Monday, July 31, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/771244/Eliminating-Plastic-Pollution-Reflections-From-Tracey-Campbell]"
406,74524fd5-d394-3111-b873-32da2f8ecdbd,LYB,2023-08-01,3 S&P 500 Stocks With a Yield Worth Betting On,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-p-500-stocks-yield-085450871.html,1690361690,STORY,"['PXD', 'DVN', 'BBY', '^GSPC', 'SPG', 'LYB']","[According to Finviz.com, if you’re looking for high yield S&amp;P 500 stocks, energy companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) at 10.75% and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) at 8.63% are the best of the best.Energy stocks have lost their momentum in 2023 — the worst-performing S&amp;P 500 sector year-to-date, down 4.1% through July 21 — so it’s unsurprising that energy stocks have some of the highest yields right now. I’m tasked with recommending three stocks from the index with a dividend yield worth betting on. I’ll exclude energy stocks from my 503 possible choices to make things interesting. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe average S&amp;P 500 yield as of July 21 was 1.5%. There are approximately 261, yielding more than that. I’ll select one from three different sectors. To add to the intrigue, the stocks selected must be up at least 10% on the year, providing a more difficult task than just picking three stocks with a higher yield. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)Source:  Andre Robillard Via UnsplashLyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) represents the basic materials sector with a current yield of 5.5%, 3.7x the average S&amp;P 500 yield. Over the past five years, it’s delivered very little to its shareholders, generating an annualized total return of 2.0%.  I’m betting the company, one of the world’s largest producers of polypropylene and other chemicals, is ready for a bit of reversion to the mean. It can’t possibly continue this streak of poor performance in the markets. Especially since its largest shareholder is Access Industries, the private holding company of Ukrainian/American billionaire Len Blavatnik; he doesn’t seem to make too many mistakes. That’s why I recently said Access is one of three dream initial public offerings I’d love to see. Of course, when you are the 35th wealthiest person in the world, you can afford to be patient. It also doesn’t hurt that Access’s 66.7 million shares generate $333 million in annual dividends (based on a $5.00 annualized dividend). Story continuesIn the trailing 12 months, it generated $3.30 billion [cash flow] in free cash flow on $47.5 billion in revenue [income statement]. That’s good for a free cash flow margin of 6.9% and a free cash flow yield of 11.2% (based on market cap) or 8.1% (based on enterprise value).   Either way, LYB stock is cheaper than it’s been in the past decade, making it an excellent value play for patient investors.  Simon Property Group (SPG)Strip mall in FLSimon Property Group’s (NYSE:SPG) current yield is 5.9% based on an annualized rate of $7.40. America’s largest mall operator remains in a funk — its shares, while up nearly 20% in the past 52 weeks, are down 26% over the past five years — despite the fact much of retail is doing just fine in 2023.Furthermore, the demise of the mall has provided the real estate investment trust an opportunity to redevelop some of its malls into alternative uses for its massive real estate footprint. For example, the REIT announced on May 31 that it broke ground on a Residence Inn by Marriott at its Northgate Station mall in Seattle.“We’re excited to work with Marriott to bring the Residence Inn brand as the next phase of the transformational development. Once complete in 2025, the new hotel will be an amenity to the community, Kraken Community Iceplex, and Northgate Station,” said Patrick Peterman, Senior Vice President of Development &amp; Mixed Use, Simon.As cities look for more housing, malls will experience considerable residential real estate growth as their parking lots get redeveloped into rental and condominium housing. With some of the best locations in the country, Simon is at the beginning of a renaissance of sorts. This makes it one of those high yield S&amp;P 500 stocks.Investors have failed to recognize the value of the land under which Simon’s malls lie. SPG is also a value play. Best Buy (BBY)Source: AmazonBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) last increased its dividend with the April 2023 payment. It now pays 92 cents a share, up 4.5% from 88 cents previously—the annualized rate of $3.68 yields a healthy 4.3%.The electronics retailer’s CEO, Corie Barry, took over from Hubert Joly in June 2019. Barry had the unenviable task of following one of America’s best turnaround artists. However, she had been with Best Buy since 1999 — through the good and bad — so she would be prepared for the events brought on by Covid-19 and post-pandemic.  The company is experiencing a slowdown in sales. Still, it’s one of those high yield S&amp;P 500 stocks.On May 25, Best Buy reported an 11% decline in revenue to $9.47 billion, with a 10.1% decline in same-store sales. On the bottom line, it earned $244 million, 28.4% less than a year ago. “We’ve been seeing a consumer who is — whether or not you call it a recession — exhibiting some recessionary behaviors,” CNBC reported Barry’s comments about the quarter. Higher interest rates will do that.Despite declining sales and earnings, it beat analyst earnings estimates — $1.15 vs. the $1.11 consensus — in Q1 2024. It also reaffirmed its guidance for 2024 of at least $43.8 billion in revenue and a same-store sales decline of 4.5% at the midpoint of its guidance. While I wouldn’t say anything from a valuation perspective stands out as being exceptionally cheap, it will be incredibly undervalued if, as Barry suggests, we are at “the bottom for the decline in tech demand.”  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The S&amp;P 500 Industrial Index generated returns of about 19.30% over the past year, whereas the broad market index has garnered 12.77% over the past year (as of Jul 27).After all, better-than-expected U.S. economic growth can result in increased business investment, infrastructure spending, and higher demand for durable goods, benefiting industrial companies. Manufacturing companies expect positive business sentiment for the second half of 2023, with automation adoption expected to boost industrial activities.Against this backdrop, below we highlight Q2 earnings results of a few renowned U.S. industrial players. Results have been mixed so far. Let’s delve a little deeper.Inside Q2 EarningsGeneral ElectricOn Jul 25, General Electric GE reported its second-quarter 2023 results. GE posted upbeat earnings due to strong demand for jet engine spare parts and services. GE currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A (as of Jul 27).The conglomerate reported adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share. However, there was a 12.8% decrease in the bottom line compared to the previous year. On the revenue front, the company generated a total of $15,861 million, which exceeded the consensus estimate of $15,085 million. This represented a notable 14.9% increase in the top line compared to the previous year.3M3M MMM reported its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 24. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, assisted by increased prices and implemented cost-saving measures. 3M currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), along with a Growth and VGM Score of A (as of Jul 27).MMM reported adjusted earnings (excluding $14.52 from non-recurring items) of $2.17 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. However, due to a negative impact from pre-tax restructuring charges, the bottom line declined by double digits year over year. 3M’s net sales of $8,325 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,955 million. However, the top line declined 4.3% year over year.Story continuesHoneywell InternationalHoneywell International HON reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 earnings before market open on Jul 27, supported by a strong performance in the aviation market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2, along with a Momentum Score of A (as of Jul 27).The conglomerate reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.23 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20. The bottom line increased 6.2% year over year. However, total revenues of $9,146 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,171 million. The top line inched up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter, due to growth in commercial aerospace, process solutions and UOP business.Union PacificOn Jul 26, Union Pacific UNP reported second quarter 2023 earnings, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues, lower volumes and an unfavorable business mix. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), along with a Growth Score of B (as of Jul 27).Union Pacific reported earnings of $2.57 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75. Moreover, the bottom line plunged 12.3% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $5,963 million as reported by the company, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,121.3 million. The top line tumbled 4.9% year over year.ETFs in FocusFor investors looking to take a bet on industrial ETFs after mixed Q2 results as well as continued U.S. economic recovery, the following ETFs provide a great opportunity, having relatively high exposure to the industrial companies discussed above.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) – up 21.38% over the past year (as of Jul 27).Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS) – up 23.06% over the past year (as of Jul 27).iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ) – up 15.88% over the past year (as of Jul 27).Fidelity MSCI Industrials Index ETF (FIDU) – up 23.20% over the past year (as of Jul 27).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's profitability continues to be negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. Disney's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Nevertheless, Disney is benefiting from the growing popularity of Disney+ core, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering. Strong line-up of movies that include Haunted Mansion, Poor Things and The Creator bodes well for the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment.The company has been nominated for several Emmy awards that suggests a content portfolio.

Strengthening the U.S. defense budget should also boost its growth. The company holds a strong solvency position in the near term.However, Boeing expects supply-chain disruptions to continue to harm its operational results, at least in the near term.

410,74733421-ca76-30d2-b37d-4d6ddb303f8e,VLO,2023-08-01,Will Production Gains Enhance Northern's (NOG) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/production-gains-enhance-northerns-nog-152800278.html,1690817280,STORY,"['NOG', 'VLO']","[It's earnings season again, and energy producer Northern Oil and Gas NOG is gearing up to release its second-quarter results on Aug 2. This time around, the company’s overall earnings performance is likely to have got a boost from strong production, only to be undone by lower oil and natural gas realizations.Investors should know that Northern employs a unique strategy wherein it owns non-operating, minority interests in thousands of oil and gas wells, which are majority-owned and operated by some leading producers. As part of this low-cost model, NOG — unlike most of its peers — does not drill any well but essentially provides financing for its acreage.Being in the business of churning out hydrocarbons, the independent upstream operator’s top and bottom lines are primarily driven by the amount of fuel it produces and energy prices.Click here for a complete rundown of the company’s expected Q2 performance.A Look at NOG’s Key Performance Parameters in Q1NOG’s first-quarter production (comprising 62% oil) surged about 25.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level to 87,385 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84,761 Boe/d. While the oil volume came in at 53,864 barrels per day (up 29.6% year over year), natural gas totaled 201,125 thousand cubic feet per day (up 19.1% from the prior-year quarter’s figure).The average sales price for crude oil was $73.31 per barrel, indicating a 19.6% decline from the prior-year period’s $91.19. The average realized natural gas price was $3.91 per thousand cubic feet compared with $6.94 a year ago.How Will These Factors Impact NOG’s Q2 Results?Northern Oil and Gas is expected to have benefited from higher output during the quarter. Considering NOG’s impressive production profile from some of the leading basins of the United States, our expectation for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s second-quarter volume is pegged at some 90,577 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), up 24.6% from the year-ago quarter’s level of 72,689 Boe/d.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Of the total, our estimate for oil production indicates around 30% increase from the year-ago period’s reported number. Further, we expect NOG’s natural gas output to rise 17.3% year over year in the second quarter.However, lower oil and natural gas realizations are likely to have hurt NOG’s revenues and cash flows. Going by our model, the company’s second-quarter average crude sales price is pegged at $71.60 per barrel — significantly down from the year-earlier level of $106.26. Additionally, our projection for the average realized natural gas prices reflects a 77.5% year-over-year drop.Story continuesOverall Earnings &amp; Revenue ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.37 per share, suggesting a 20.4% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. For quarterly sales, the consensus mark of $413.5 million suggests a drop of 24.8% from the year-earlier quarter’s reported number.Important Energy Releases So FarWhile we wait till Wednesday for NOG to come up with Q2 numbers, let’s take a look at some key energy releases so far.SLB SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced second-quarter 2023 earnings of 72 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. SLB’s bottom line also significantly increased from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 50 cents.SLB’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from higher stimulation services and strong activities across all areas. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had approximately $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. It had a long-term debt of $11.3 billion at the end of the second quarter.Meanwhile, U.S. integrated major Chevron CVX reported adjusted second-quarter earnings per share of $3.08, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95. The outperformance could be attributed to a higher-than-expected bottom line in the company’s key upstream segment. The unit’s profit of $4.9 billion came in well above our estimate of $2.9 billion as domestic production hit a new high.CVX recorded $6.3 billion in cash flow from operations compared to $13.8 billion a year ago. The decreasing cash flow could be attributed to weaker price realizations in the upstream business. Chevron’s free cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Further, the company paid $2.8 billion in dividends and bought back $4.4 billion worth of its shares.Finally, we have refining giant Valero Energy VLO reporting Q2 adjusted earnings of $5.40 per share that came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.08 per share. The beat was primarily driven by increased renewable diesel sales volumes and a decline in VLO’s total costs of sales.The downstream operator’s second-quarter capital investment was $458 million. Of the total, $382 million was allotted for sustaining the business. As of Jun 30, Valero had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion. Moreover, VLO carried total debt and finance lease obligations of $11.3 billion on its books.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to FFO of $0.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 6.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.47 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.51, delivering a surprise of 8.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Kite Realty Group , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $208.76 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.54%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $202.61 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Kite Realty Group shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.3%.What's Next for Kite Realty Group?While Kite Realty Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kite Realty Group: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.48 on $201.17 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.97 on $816.5 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

However, for many growth stocks, their stock prices don’t reflect the new “bull market,” and remain depressed. Suppose we exclude the FAANGs and look at the bigger picture. In that case, you can invest in two types of growth stocks: momentum stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which runs purely on hype and analyst speculations instead of financials. Or, you could look into growth stocks that remain in an undervalued range after the selloffs in the last two years. There aren’t many that are in the middle.For the first option, I find it too risky right now. The economy is yet to digest all the rate hikes, and I would not say a recession is out of the question yet. But, of course, that’s not something anyone can predict. But what I can say with almost certainty is that this AI rally is unsustainable and will soon fall on its face. As I’ve argued multiple times before, analysts are ignoring the competition many AI companies face, and much speculation is being baked into their sales projections.Thus, the second option is much more compelling. Buying into depressed companies exposes you to growth and substantial upside potential with very little downside risk if things go wrong. There are many millionaire-maker growth stocks that fall into this category. Let’s look at seven of those.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMillionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: International Seaways (INSW)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockAn American company “providing energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in International Flag markets,” International Seaways (NYSE:INSW) has seen explosive financial growth in the last two years. Especially after Russia invaded Ukraine. As Europe nullifies its Russian energy imports, this company has been a key beneficiary of this process. Europe now relies heavily on tankers to satisfy its energy needs, and this company operates a fleet of 75 very profitable vessels.Story continuesThat’s very well reflected in the company’s financials, with a net margin of 54% and year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 186% in the latest quarter. However, the share price hasn’t kept pace, and the stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of just 4 times. Yes, growth is expected to decline in the long run, but all the possible cons seem priced at this valuation. Many also think that this company’s future depends on the Ukraine-Russia war and will tumble once it ends. That’s not true at all. Even if the war were to end today, the NATO countries would not be willing to lift their sanctions on Russia. Thus, this is a clear buy in my eyes.Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: Crown Castle (CCI)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) specializes in wireless communication infrastructure, such as cell towers. This should immediately bring Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) into your mind, and indeed, this is a very similar company. The stock price has also been similar recently, but the financials here are very different.Even though it is not a new company, it is still in its growth phase. Looking at its long-term stock price trend makes that quite evident. The company has retained positive top-line growth for almost a decade straight if you discount the one quarter of negative growth amidst the pandemic. It grew sales by 7.7% YOY in Q1, and profits also expanded by 8%. These metrics should imply healthy stock price appreciation, but the reality is different.Since the start of 2022, CCI stock has been down almost 47%. That’s even more than VZ, which is declining. I believe this opens up a great opportunity to snap up the stock, considering it also has a 5.6% dividend yield to sweeten the deal. These dividends have been increasing for eight years consecutively.Millionaire-Maker Growth Stocks: Smartsheet (SMAR)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockSmartsheet (NYSE:SMAR) is a cloud-based platform that enables teams to collaborate, manage, and automate work processes. The company has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by the increased demand for digital transformation and remote work solutions. However, bears have been worried about the company’s competition and slowing growth. That’s true, but the sharp correction through last year has taken SMAR to bargain levels, and snapping up the stock is a good idea.As for the growth, analysts still expect a healthy 20% top-line growth YOY through 2026. Profit growth is also expected to be robust, with EPS tripling from FY24 to FY26. I expect even higher growth, considering the company’s earlier disappointments have caused low expectations among analysts. It beat EPS estimates and revenue estimates by 137.98% and 2.7%, respectively, in the latest quarter. All things considered, I expect a solid upside here.Estee Lauder (EL)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a cosmetics company that many may notice has been sliding out of the growth category. Wall Street has punished the business for the red ink, and it now sits almost 52% below its peak. Not only that, the current share price is even lower than what it was in Q4 2019.I believe there’s a great opportunity here since the business is expected to continue delivering double-digit sales growth after an 11% decline this year. Even better, EPS is expected to more than double in the next two years from $3.35 to $6.71. These metrics should cause the stock to bounce back sharply from the current trough, and analysts’ price targets imply a 30% gain on average. That’s excellent, considering the current market conditions.Zoom (ZM)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockIf you haven’t heard of Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), you could be living under a rock. This platform became a household name during the pandemic era with very explosive growth. However, the magic died down just as quickly, and it now sits a quarter below its pre-pandemic high in Aug. 2019. RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) might also ring a bell for savvy investors, as these companies have interlinked growth stories. I’m bullish on both, but I consider ZM a superior buy, even though it has lower growth for now.The company has meager liabilities with a liquidity buffer of $5.6 billion, and all the cons here are now priced in. It has also been trading sideways for more than a year and a half. Thus, I only see it going up from here.Furthermore, I would point out that video conferencing and remote work haven’t died down with the pandemic. If anything, this has only accelerated the trend towards remote work, and these trends will slowly materialize over a multi-year period. Analysts realize this and see Zoom’s sales growth slowly creeping higher in the years ahead. YOY sales growth is expected to be 5.6% in FY2026 from 2% in FY2024.Luminar Technologies (LAZR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) is among the stocks I have been the most bullish on, but it is not without controversy. The company is in the LiDAR sector, and the future of it is hotly contested and debated. Simply put, LiDAR offers much better technology for self-driving cars but at a higher cost. Many car manufacturers have started to adopt this technology, but many also think that it is too expensive to succeed.I disagree that LiDAR cannot succeed. That’s because it is still in its early stages, and the technology is slowly being refined to be much more inexpensive. It now costs a fraction of what you’d pay just five years ago, and industry experts believe the costs will fall even further. I believe costs will go down enough for it to be adopted en masse for self-driving vehicles, and since Luminar Technology is in the driving seat here, I am very bullish on it. Even better, LAZR stock is sitting at a depressed level already, down 81% from its peak and over a year of sideways action.The focus on profits has also contributed to the stock’s depression, but cash is not a factor here. This company is unlikely to run into a cash crunch with such high sales growth and guides over $300 in cash by year-end and a positive gross margin. Analysts believe the company will end 2023 with 112% YOY sales growth, which will climb to a blistering 207% next year. A strong buy!M3 Inc (MTHRY)growth stocks. Growth Stocks to SellSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.comM3 (OTCMKTS:MTHRY) is a Japanese healthcare company that provides services to the life science industry. It offers a wide range of solutions, including interactive marketing, education, content, hiring, and research. M3’s goal is to use the internet to help people live longer and healthier lives and to reduce unnecessary medical costs. To say that the company is under the radar would be an understatement, and little research about it is available in English. Thankfully, it does have ADRs, and you can buy this bargain without hassle before it bounces back up from its current trough.This company has no debt and a net margin of 21.24%, better than 94% of its healthcare peers, and modest sales growth going forward. The valuation is the most compelling, trading almost 80% below its 2021 peak. Gurufocus notes it as significantly undervalued with a fair price tag of $35 by 2026, 250% higher than its current price.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Thank consumers not buying ""stuff"" and instead opting for services like Marriott vacations. Whatever the case, the line items for costs of goods sold are finally showing major relief, and the market is sniffing out what that could be in future quarters.Take for instance oil prices, which have plunged 20% in the past year. With that comes a cascade of lower costs throughout the supply chain. Lumber prices are down 25% in the last year — great news for everyone from homebuilders such as Toll Brothers (TOL) to companies building new plants.The cost of electricity has dropped considerably, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest in new value-creating goods and services.To be sure, investors are already getting a taste of how this dramatically altered cost environment could impact profits this earnings season.P&amp;G's CEO Jon Moeller told me late last week that, over the next 12 months, the Tide maker will save $400 million on commodity costs.It has been three years since Moeller and I have discussed commodities prices going lower — and I talk to the guy every quarter. The change in tone around costs certainly caught my attention, hence this Monday column.""So it's not all a bed of roses, but it's a lot better looking than it was last year at this time, and our guidance reflects that,"" Moeller told me on the inflation topic.The high end of P&amp;G's new fiscal year profit outlook was $0.06 ahead of consensus estimates.Top execs from PepsiCo to Campbell Soup to Nucor have given me the same vibe on the cost backdrop too.And when all is said and done, I think these deflationary forces will be the story of this particular earnings season.The Charging Bull bronze sculpture is shown around Wall Street and The New York Stock Exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on September 2 2020 (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Photo) (zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)Analysts forgot commodities deflation and investors are playing catch up, clearly.Story continuesFactSet data shows that 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise so far.Impressive — and I would argue it has been a key factor in the market's strong advance in recent weeks.Some on the Street are finally getting it as seen in forward profit estimates.For the fourth quarter, analysts are projecting 7.5% year-over-year earnings growth — an acceleration from a 0.2% increase in the third quarter.Investors love profit acceleration stories.When that story happens later this year, a better commodities backdrop will be to thank.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Carriers have been relying on strong demand to offset higher costs.On an earnings call, JetBlue said its revenue was facing a difficult year-on-year comparison. The company said while passenger volumes remain ""very strong"", fares are moving back towards their pre-pandemic levels.Like leisure carrier Alaska Air, JetBlue said soaring demand for long-haul international trips has led to a drop in domestic travel.While JetBlue expects the trend to improve in the fourth quarter, around the winter holidays, it is still estimated to hurt the company's full-year earnings.JetBlue now expects full-year adjusted profit of 5 cents to 40 cents per share, compared with its previous forecast of 70 cents to $1 per share. It warned of an adjusted loss of as much as 20 cents a share in the third quarter.The company also forecast a hit from the unwinding of its three-year-old alliance with American Airlines, which allowed the two carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue.Profit for the second quarter came in at 45 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 44 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.JetBlue said it is looking to redeploy capacity to high-margin leisure destinations. It has already made some adjustments to its capacity in Boston and plans to cut some flights out of New York.Story continuesSeparately, the company is facing issues with RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets. JetBlue said it has a handful of engines that will have to come off-wing by mid-September.As a result, it expects the number of its aircraft on the ground to double this year. Chief Financial Officer Ursula Hurley said the company was still working with both Airbus and Pratt &amp; Whitney to assess the impact on its aircraft deliveries next year.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Kannaki Deka in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Jan Harvey)]"

A new report from Bloomberg shows that purchases made directly through the major U.S. airlines fell in the second quarter. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the report and explains why consumers may be starting to pull back.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: We're going to take a look at some of the trending stories of the day. Josh Schafer is here to help us break it all down. And guys, first up, let's talk about the travel boom or maybe lack thereof pretty soon, because it might be signs that it could be fading here. There's new data compiled by Bloomberg and taking a look at flights booked directly through airlines. And they found an interesting trend. And that's the fact that that number declined in the second quarter for eight of the 10 domestic, largest domestic airlines here.So you got to ask yourself whether or not inflation is starting to catch up with consumers, when it comes-- obviously has a lot of ways-- when it comes to spending on travel, an area that we haven't necessarily seen any weakness in yet, at least for the airlines.JOSH SCHAFER: And the other interesting thing I saw in that article, Diane, was that they were pointing out that Alaska Airlines actually said that prices came down, right? So when you think about even just-- even if demand does come down right and people have less money to spend, also if these airlines are charging less money for the flights, you would need more people to go on the flights. So I think that's kind of an interesting dynamic at play, too, when you think about pricing power and just flight prices being a little bit cheaper.Does that mean that all of a sudden we're going to start taking two flights again? I don't know. We're so used to these flights being expensive, right?DIANE KING HALL: I mean, but it also, you wonder if it's a tale of two airlines. I mean, you had Delta Airlines doing great. I mean, they hiked their forecast. Delta and United both doing well, though. United had some snafus recently. And it's certainly not helpful to the airlines when you have all the travel problems and the mess at the airport. I experienced that this weekend myself due to weather, of course, so they can kind of blame it away. And that certainly doesn't kind of help the travel picture.Story continuesI do-- I did feel like just-- I mean, this is anecdotally that demand was still holding up right now. But again, we're talking about summer bookings, which are basically done.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And it's very important to point out that this data actually tracks when they are booked rather than-- so right now, rather than the airlines who actually obviously don't really take it into account until the actual flight until you go on the flight, until that revenue is actually produced. But prices, they're still above where we were in 2019. So they're down on a year-over-year basis. But 2022, the flights-- the prices that we were looking at a year ago was astronomical and not much improvement.But I think right now, when people are feeling so pressured in almost every aspect of their life, if you've already gone on a few trips since COVID, maybe that pent-up demand story that we've been talking about for so long, that's going to fade. And I think this is the question and this was-- we were struggling really to try to put the timeline on this of when we would actually see some impact when it comes to the travel names. And at least when you look at this index, and it doesn't include booking sites, it doesn't include corporate sales, we are starting to see some of that weakness.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, and we haven't even talked about business travel, right, when we're talking about flights overall and airlines overall.DIANE KING HALL: --leisure travel.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. And that's something that Southwest flagged last week, right? Bob Jordan saying that basically, they're not seeing business travel come back all the way to the extent that they thought they were going to. And they're not sure when it's going to come back. So then you think about that with maybe the general consumer demand that was maybe even a little bit higher than normal coming down. And you have a tough-- that's a tough balance.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. The business travel will come back. But will it be enough to compensate for the reduction in consumer? Because revenge spending won't last forever.SEANA SMITH: I question if business travel is really going to come back across the board.DIANE KING HALL: You don't think so? I think it will.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. You would have thought, at this point, maybe it would have. But some airlines are saying that they're very confident that we are going to get there if they haven't reached there yet. I'm still a bit skeptical. But we'll see.]"

TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker tells Yahoo Finance Live that demand has begun to shift from domestic to international travel. Becker ""American (Airlines), Delta, and United have done really well this year"" because they have the most exposure to international travel.Video Transcript- Let's get to airlines in particular and the numbers that they've been reporting and have yet to report. It's been a mixed picture for the industry this year despite raised forecasts from the likes of Delta and American Airlines and soaring earnings as travel demand remains strong. There are still cost concerns and looming pilot shortages still lingering.For more on the state of the industry, we're joined by Helane Becker, TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst. Helane, it's always good to see you. We've heard from most of them. We still have JetBlue to report tomorrow. But kind of give us a state of play of where we are given what we've heard so far.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. I think-- thanks for the question. I think what we're seeing in terms of demand is still very, very strong demand but pricing has come off their peaks. And I guess it was just not sustainable that ticket prices would stay as robust as they were, number one. And number two, I think you're seeing a shift as well. We've talked about demand being strong domestically for 2021 and 2022 and then shifting internationally for '23 and '24.And that's what we're seeing. We're seeing very strong North Atlantic demand and Europe. And I'm going to say air quotes around everybody seems to be in Italy this summer. And then next summer we think we'll see strong demand on the Trans-pacific for all markets except for probably China.- And so Helane, with that kind of international travel focus that you were just alluding to a moment ago, who are the biggest beneficiaries from your coverage and perspective?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, exactly. That's why American, Delta, and United have done really well this year because they have the most exposure. And United specifically is more exposed to international markets than any of the other airlines. JetBlue has a couple of flights, one to Paris one to London. And I think they're adding Amsterdam next month. And that's it. Some of the other smaller US airlines, like Frontier and Spirit fly near US markets. So they'll do Caribbean, Mexico, Northern South America.Story continuesBut that's that demand was part of last year's strength. This year's strength is really on the North Atlantic and most airlines, with the exception actually of United, got rid of all their widebody or a lot of their widebody aircraft during the pandemic. And now with the demand shifting, they're having a hard time keeping up because they don't have the aircraft to put into service. And that's why you've seen American and Delta come out with some aircraft orders. And B, the other thing that we've seen in terms of demand for aircraft a shift to least in aircraft or buying aircraft off from the Lessor's primarily because the OEMs are still lagging on deliveries.- Even with the strong demand environment, it seems like some of the travel headaches are still looming large. You ask passengers just-- and I mean, you're nodding in concert with perhaps a lot of the emotions and feelings of some of our viewers right now. How does that kind of add on a knock on effect to some of the airlines right now that are either bringing capacity, continuing to bring that back online, or have code sharing agreements where they're sending passengers through some of the rigmarole of just how if they miss their flights where they need to rebook, who gets the credit, so forth. What type of knock on the stock does that eventually create, if any?HELANE BECKER: Yeah, no, that's a really great question. So I mean, it's just so frustrating for passengers. You plan all year long for your vacation, you're looking forward to it, and then something goes wrong the day that you travel. And it's not always the fault of the airlines. Sometimes it's weather that creeps in, especially summer storms. Those are so unpredictable versus, we've talked about this before, Brad you and I, the winter storms are almost always predictable. You know when you're going to get a big snowstorm. But with summer pop up thunderstorms, you don't.And then there are downstream delays, to your point. And then passengers get frustrated. And I think the eventual effect will be, well, we sort of did that. I'm tired of all my flights being delayed or many flights being delayed. I'm just not going to take a trip that month or that week. I'm going to try to find a day of the week, like Tuesday, Wednesday, that might be less busy. And that does definitely impact results at some point. It's just right now everybody, again, those air quotes, wants to travel.And until schools start to resume and in some cases, especially Southern tier of the US, they'll start to resume next week and the week after, you'll still see strong travel out of the Northeast. And we don't-- that's not going to stop because those bookings are already made. But we've seen airports start to hire more people in an effort to help during the busiest times. And yeah, it just gets really frustrating. I get it.And I always say to people, welcome to my life. I feel like for every [AUDIO OUT] that's on time or early, I'm going to pay for it with a later canceled flight at some point in my future.- Well, it's funny, Helane, because as the airlines try to manage through it-- just as an example, my son was flying this weekend. We got a message from the airline the night before, you might want to think about pushing your trip because there are thunderstorms forecast for the next day. Guess what, no thunderstorms. Totally clear. The flight left on time. So I'd be pretty upset if I changed my flight with the anticipation that the--So it really does seem like a no win situation but it also seems like a situation that technology and more staffing could at least help. So that implies that the airlines are going to have to spend more to address this, especially if the demand remains even close to the fever pitch where it's been.HELANE BECKER: Yeah. No, you're absolutely right. And the demand that we're seeing also is pretty equal to what we saw in 2019 but the mix is different. It's more leisure and it's less business. And I think one difference is that people who are infrequent travelers get more stressed out than people who are frequent travelers and know that this type of thing happens is, quote unquote, ""all the time.""But the other thing, to your point, one of the things that technology could do for the airlines is an enable connecting passengers to change the connecting hub. So if you're coming from mid-con and let's say you're coming out of Saint Louis and you're going to London and your first choice was to connect over New York, if New York is going to have thunderstorms, maybe Boston doesn't or Chicago doesn't. Maybe those storms have passed through.From the airline's perspective, they should be able to reroute you over a different hub and their technology should enable either you to do that on their website or your iPhone or your smart device, or they can do it for you so that you don't miss a day of your vacation because, to your point, just because there are forecast thunderstorms in my town, there may not be in yours. So we can-- they should be able to, with technology, make those adjustments.And that's something that I find interesting because the industry was an early adopter of technology and using computers to issue boarding passes and check bags, and so on. And then through the bankruptcies that they all experienced in the last or two decades ago and they lagged on updating their technology. And I think they're starting to think about catching up now.- Helane, just while we have you, we asked the CFO of Chipotle last week-- and follow me on this one. We asked the CFO of Chipotle last week how global warming could impact how they think about their business. And that was with regard to kind of sourcing the necessary menu items.For airlines and the travel experience, I mean, you just talked about storms and more severe weather that they have to account for and communicate that to their passengers. And their passengers may eventually shift some of the travel schedules around unknown parts of the year where there could be extreme weather that derails their trip plans. Is there a broader kind of concern or at least a thought or evaluation that these companies are starting to give around global warming and how that changes what the customer propensity is to travel at certain times of the year?HELANE BECKER: Yeah. That's a really great question because it's something that we've been looking at for the last year or so. And it's slightly different-- well, in two different ways. One, exactly what you're saying. Markets like Seattle for an example that historically wouldn't have snow, it would have rain, but it wouldn't be so overwhelming rain that it would shut the airport down for an extended period of time. And yet last winter, you saw Seattle experience snow and ice.So you're definitely seeing that weather pattern shift that's causing airports that haven't had to deal with de-icing or runway clearing to have to start thinking about their investments in de-icing pads, de-icing fluid, and so on. So that's definitely one thing that we are paying attention to and I think the airlines and the airports are starting to think about. We're seeing that at various conferences that's being added as a discussion item. So yes to that part.And then the other part that I would say is with respect to sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has some commitment with a producer of SAF to provide that to them over the next, say, decade because a lot of those orders go out that far. And the government through the Inflation Reduction Act is incentivizing manufacturers, the energy manufacturers, to produce more SAF.And that's really the problem. Airlines are only 2% of emissions but the longest flights are 80% of the total emissions. So it's not really a-- like road transport is still the number one emissions. But that said, airlines are an easy target and we need more sustainable aviation fuel. Every airline has said, we're there to buy it if you make it. And you just have to do it in a cost effective manner.The industry worldwide, Brad, to give you an idea of the numbers, uses 100 billion gallons of jet fuel annually. And the amount of sustainable aviation fuel that's out there right now is less than 5%. I don't even think it's 1%. So it's not even-- like it's in the ballpark of what's needed. And that's a 20-- I say that's a 2025 to 2040 development. That's where you're going to see the industry go over the next 15 years.- Helane, always a fascinating conversation. Thanks so much for taking the time to really break down what you're tracking over at TD Cowen. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker joining us this morning. Thanks so much.]"

(NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 29th of September to $0.65. This will take the annual payment to 3.3% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, Principal Financial Group was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 22.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 33%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.84 total annually to $2.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though Principal Financial Group's EPS has declined at around 4.6% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Principal Financial Group's DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

""It was in sales for another financial institution, and I quickly realized it was not the right role for me,"" Keiser says.Fortune had other plans for Keiser: She connected with a friend working at Principal&amp;reg;, which led to a position in the retirement division. ""I consider that my first real job,"" laughs Keiser, who is now vice president, retirement product management.Graduation followed by two jobs in rapid succession might be disconcerting for many, but not Keiser. If anything has defined her nearly three-decade-long career, it's been an embrace of change. ""If you're willing to learn, you can do a lot of different things,"" she says.From the basketball court to corporate lifeA fourth-generation farm kid from South Dakota, Keiser was a math-loving, standout basketball star in a high school class of just 28. College recruiters came calling, and Keiser was determined to find a place that would cover tuition and enable her to do something she loved (basketball) while earning a degree she would use (business). ""My parents didn't go to college, and I wanted to start off life without debt,"" she says.At the University of South Dakota, the basketball team was a four-year immersion in building good habits and managing deadlines. ""I learned quickly to say no to things that weren't critical to the mission-to get work done without letting distractions get in the way,"" Keiser says. ""My teammates became my family, and those are still my lifelong friends. I got a great education-I got my ROI.""Post-graduation and living in Des Moines, Keiser's first Principal job turned into 17 years of tenure, as she willingly took on one challenge after another. ""A lot of times, there weren't instruction manuals-we had to figure out problems or integrate opportunities into the company,"" Keiser says. ""I discovered that I enjoyed learning new things, and that helped me navigate my career. It's fun and rewarding to learn from the ground up.""Leaving, and coming back to, PrincipalThen one day, a recruiter came calling; there was a position open with a firm in Denver. Was Keiser interested?With three kids not yet in high school, she knew if she and her husband were going to move her family, she'd have to take the leap. ""I'm energized by change,"" Keiser says. ""I wanted to see if I could learn a new company and bring value to a different organization.""She could and she did ... which made her open to a call from Principal five years later. ""I grew so much in that time, but I also had a great experience from my 17 years at Principal,"" Keiser says. ""The position at Principal offered a unique opportunity to own something. I could add something to the team I couldn't before.""So back to Principal she came, but this time, remotely. ""My husband has been following me for 20 years, and he had the opportunity to take over his family farm,"" Keiser says. They relocated not to Des Moines, but South Dakota. That's given Keiser a chance to put a post-pandemic hybrid work model to the test: She's in the Des Moines office twice a month. ""I do my best thinking when driving,"" Keiser says with a smile.Love what you doOn the basketball court, Keiser learned some fundamental lessons that have continued to guide her: Everyone brings something different to the effort. The best teams learn how to work together. When things are not going well or as planned, you have to get back up and get back to work.""At Principal, every day we're working with people from all parts of the world and from all walks of life,"" she says. ""We all benefit when we learn how to support each other's strengths.""The culture at Principal helps, Keiser believes. ""We invest in our people, and that's even more important coming out of the pandemic,"" she says. ""I have the connections I built those first 17 years, and new connections I'm building, too.""She's also building connections-some still in basketball-in her family's new community. Keiser volunteers with the local girls' team, and, of course, helps on her family's farm when time allows. ""I have such joy in what I do-I work for a Fortune 200 company but get to hang out with my family on the farm,"" she says. ""I've never been afraid to roll up my sleeves and get the job done.""Passion-for basketball-drove Keiser along her path for a little while, but passion of a different sort drives her now. ""I've realized you could chase a job title or something that sounds big and important,"" she says.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Eaton is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ETN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.12 per share for ETN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ETN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.36% heading into earnings season.Eaton Corporation plc Price and EPS SurpriseEaton Corporation plc Price and EPS SurpriseEaton Corporation plc price-eps-surprise | Eaton Corporation plc QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

The insurer delivered an earnings beat in three of the last four quarters, while missing in one, the average surprise being 18.61%.Factors to NoteUNM’s premiums in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have benefited from solid persistency in-force business and strong sales across segments.Premiums are likely to have improved banking on strength at its Unum US and Colonial segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter premium is pegged at $2.5 billion, implying an improvement of 2.9% from the prior-year reported figure. We expect premiums to rise 2.5% to $2.5 billion.  The Unum U.S. segment is likely to have benefited from favorable benefits experience in group product lines, sable performance at supplemental and voluntary lines, disciplined sales trends, strong persistency in group lines and growth of new product lines. Higher operating expenses might have been a partial offset. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter premium income at the Unum U.S. segment is pegged at $1.6 billion, implying an improvement of 3.6% from the prior-year reported figure. We expect premiums to rise 3.9% to $1.6 billion.Favorable benefits experience, higher premium income, in-force block growth and higher sales are likely to have favored performance at Colonial Life. The upside is likely to have been partially offset by higher operating expenses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter premium income at the Colonial Life segment stands at $434 million, indicating an increase of 1.4% from the prior-year level. We expect premiums to rise 1.9% to $436 million.Growth in the in-force block, resulting from the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line and higher persistency, is likely to have benefited Unum International in the to-be-reported quarter. Solid business in the United Kingdom and Poland are also likely to have accelerated the improvement.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter premium income at the Unum International segment stands at $188 million, indicating an increase of 5.1% from the year-ago reported quarter. We expect premiums to rise 4% to $187 million.Expenses are likely to have increased because of higher policy benefits, interest and debt expense, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and compensation expense. We expect total benefits and expenses to be $2.6 billion.A continued share buyback is likely to have provided a boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.87, indicating a decrease of 2.1% from the year-ago reported figure.Story continuesQuantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Unum Group this time around.

439,7766d0c0-0397-362d-8747-15abaaa232de,AFL,2023-08-01,Will Reduced Premiums Hurt MetLife's (MET) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reduced-premiums-hurt-metlifes-met-163000024.html,1690821000,STORY,"['MET', 'AEL', 'AFL', 'ARES']","[MetLife, Inc. MET is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $1.85 has declined by 5 cents in the past week. The estimated figure suggests a decrease of 7.5% from the prior-year reported number. Also, the consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $17.1 billion indicates a 6.4% fall from the year-ago reported figure.MetLife’s earnings beat the consensus estimate in two of the prior four quarters and missed twice, with the average surprise being 0.7%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-eps-surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at MET’s previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading insurance-based global financial services company reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.52, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% due to reduced returns, lower investment income despite a high interest rate environment and rising expenses. The negatives were partially offset by volume growth across some segments and improved contributions from the U.S., EMEA and Latin America businesses.Now let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to Note   Reduced premiums, higher costs and weaker performance in the Retirement &amp; Income Solutions business are likely to have affected MetLife’s second-quarter results. Our estimate for premiums for the quarter under review suggests a fall of more than 6% from the prior-year quarter.Also, our model indicates that Universal Life and Investment-Type Product Policy Fees for the second quarter will see a 7.3% year-over-year decrease. Rising costs and expenses are likely to have affected the company’s profit levels in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for total expenses for the second quarter indicates a more than 5% year-over-year increase.Story continuesThe company is expected to have witnessed lower profits from Retirement &amp; Income Solutions and MetLife Holdings businesses in the second quarter. While we expect adjusted pre-tax income from the Retirement &amp; Income Solutions business to have declined almost 14% year over year, the same from MetLife Holdings is likely to have dropped more than 28%.Further, our estimate for adjusted pre-tax income in Asia indicates a nearly 38% plunge from the prior-year period. The above-mentioned factors are likely to have led to a year-over-year decline in profits, making an earnings beat uncertain.However, our estimate for net investment income indicates a 21.7% year-over-year increase from the year-ago period. We expect MET’s U.S. Group Benefits’ adjusted revenues to increase 1.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reading.Our estimate for adjusted revenues in Latin America indicates a jump of 11.4% from the year-ago period’s actuals. These are expected to have partially offset the negatives in the quarter under review.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MetLife this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $1.85 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MetLife currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for MetLife, here are some companies in the broader Finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company AEL has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

We expect the metric to be $544.5 million.The Exchange segment is likely to have benefited from higher transaction revenues, increase in listings, growth in agricultural commodities and equity derivatives business.

We expect the metric to be $1.1 billion.The Mortgage Technology segment’s revenues are likely to have been affected by lower mortgage origination volumes driven by rising interest rates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $258 million, indicating a 13.1% decrease from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the metric to be $257 million.Expenses are likely to have decreased because of lower compensation and benefits, professional services, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, technology and communication, and rent and occupancy.ICE expects second-quarter 2023 operating expenses in the range of $905-$915 million, while adjusted operating expenses are expected in the range of $763-$773 million.

However, an active catastrophe environment and continued inflationary pressures are likely to have dampened growth prospects for insurers. Some of the insurers, including The Allstate Corporation ALL, Aflac Incorporated AFL, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial, Inc. PRU and Unum Group UNM, are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Aug 1.The insurance space is housed within the broader Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Per the latest Earnings Preview, the total earnings of finance companies for second-quarter 2023 are anticipated to rise 13.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. These companies’ revenues are anticipated to improve 7.4% year over year.Factors Likely to Shape Insurers’ Performance in Q2Revenues of insurance companies are likely to have benefited from an expanding premium base, which resulted from continued rate hikes, exposure growth and solid customer retention rates in the second quarter. Growing premiums bode well for insurers as they account for a significant chunk to their top line.The commercial property insurance rates in the United States witnessed an increase of 10.7% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Texas-based insurance distribution and underwriting company, MarketScout. According to the same source, rate increases in general liability and inland marine insurance lines registered rate increases of 7% and 5%, respectively, in the second quarter. A solid capital position enables insurers to pursue an M&amp;A strategy to build diversified portfolios, which is likely to have minimized concentration risks and boosted the sale of insurance policies in the second quarter. Higher policy sales might fetch higher premiums to insurers.Story continuesHowever, an active catastrophe environment is expected to have created roadblocks for insurers’ underwriting results in the to-be-reported quarter. Per JP Morgan analysts, insured losses from major natural catastrophes are likely to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter, with the majority of such losses stemming from storms in June. Despite its associated share of worries, catastrophe losses usually ramp up the policy renewal rate and prompt insurers to implement rate hikes. Insurers are also equipped with reinsurance covers and favorable reserve development to counter catastrophe losses.For insurers having exposure to rate-sensitive products, an improved interest rate environment is expected to have boosted their investment yields in the second quarter. An aging U.S. population might have sustained the solid demand for insurance and protection products of life insurers, fetching steady premium flows.A higher number of cars plying on roads as a result of receding pandemic effects is likely to have boosted auto premiums of insurers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, persistent inflationary headwinds and uninterrupted claim expenses might have exerted strain on the profits of auto insurers.The resumption of commercial and industrial activities in full swing is expected to have provided an impetus to the demand for worker compensation insurance coverage in the second quarter.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in light of a booming digital era, which are expected to have accelerated claim payments and automated processes. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the second quarter.   Let’s find out how the following insurers are placed before their second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 1.The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Allstate: Its results are likely to have benefited on the back of higher premiums in the Property-Liability segment resulting from improved average premiums in its auto insurance business and policy growth in the homeowners’ insurance business.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Aflac is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AFL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.44 per share for AFL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share.

While the company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.This Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a first-quarter 2023 FFO per share of $2.74, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80. While results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues on healthy leasing activity, higher operating expenses acted as a dampener.Over the preceding four quarters, Simon Property’s FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed on the other, the average beat being 0.32%. This is depicted in the graph below:Simon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSimon Property Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Simon Property Group, Inc. QuoteIn this article, we will dive deep into the U.S. retail real estate market environment and the company's fundamentals and analyze the factors that may have contributed to its second-quarter 2023 performance.US Retail Real Estate Market in Q2Per a report from CBRE Group CBRE, in the U.S. retail real estate market, rent growth has recommenced in the second quarter of 2023 despite the lower demand for space.During the quarter, the net absorption of U.S. retail space amounted to 5.9 million square feet, representing the lowest level of demand since the sector experienced a negative net absorption of 10.1 million square feet in the third quarter of 2020. However, due to elevated construction costs and economic concerns, construction completions remained at historically low levels.Amid these, the overall availability rate declined by 10 basis points (bps) in the second quarter to a record low of 4.8%. Additionally, the average asking rent experienced a year-over-year increase of 2.1%, reaching $23.21 per square foot. This growth was primarily driven by significant gains in Raleigh and various Florida markets, per the CBRE Group report.Story continuesFactors at PlaySimon Property's portfolio of premium assets, both in the United States and internationally, is expected to have benefited from the favorable retail real estate environment. Amid growing consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime, the demand for SPG’s properties is likely to have remained healthy, aiding occupancy levels and leasing activity in the quarter. We estimate total portfolio ending occupancy of 94.5% in the second quarter, reflecting a 10 bps improvement sequentially.Simon Property’s adoption of an omnichannel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well. Moreover, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, are anticipated to have enabled it to tap growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.24 billion, up from $1.19 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues stands at $28.8 million, marginally below the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $28.81. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.33 billion, indicating an increase of 3.64% year over year.We expect the company’s robust balance sheet position to have supported its strategic expansions during the quarter to be reported.However, the economic slowdown amid macroeconomic uncertainty and higher e-commerce adoption might have cast a pall on SPG’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, rising interest rates might have raised expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. We estimate a 7.5% year-over-year increase in interest expenses in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has remained unrevised at $2.91 over the past month. The figure indicates a decrease of 1.69% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Simon Property this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.42 %.

If you want to skip our analysis of the global sugar market and its impact on the economies of the world's biggest sugar producers, read 8 Countries That Produce The Most Sugar. Brazil, India, and China lead the countries that produce the most sugar; these nations collectively make up 41% of the global production. If we talk about Brazil, its hold in the sugar industry is powered by expansive sugarcane fields and a favorable climate. However, a substantial portion of Brazil's sugarcane harvest is diverted to ethanol production due to government mandates and global biofuel demand. On the other end of the supply chain, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Cuba, and Malaysia are the Countries With The Highest Sugar Consumption.The white, refined sugar we see comes from either sugar cane or sugar beet, the two sugar crops whose growth determines a country's ability to produce processed sugar. Sugarcane is native to tropical regions in South Asia and is the world's largest crop in production, with over 1.966 billion tons produced in the previous crop year. Once cut, the cane stalks are crushed to extract the juice, which is then purified and crystallized to produce raw sugar.Intriguingly, sugar beet is a root crop that many don't presume is a source of sugar, but it very much is. Of the 20 countries that produce the most sugar, four heavily rely on sugar beet, namely the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and France, as the crop primarily grows in the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere. Sugarcane is also the most consumed crop in the world, as its global consumption reached 1.966 billion tons in the crop year 2021/2022. Explore 15 Most Consumed Crops in the World to learn more about the most significant crops. Global Sugar Market OverviewAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sugar market is $46.4 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $59.1 billion by 2028. The market will grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028, owing to increasing demand for processed food and beverages. Story continuesThe food and beverage industry is a significant consumer of raw sugar and affects market trends to a great extent. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American youth consumes 143 calories from SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) daily, while the consumption is 145 calories for older people. If we talk about average sugar consumption (including beverages, refined sugar, etc.), American adults take 17 teaspoons of added sugar every day, which is 2-3 times higher than the recommended amount as per the American Heart Association. While refined sugar's raw calories are associated with obesity and other health issues, it's imperative for the beverage and processed food industry. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are two titans of the beverage industry. The global market presence, along with a massive demand for sugar to produce their flagship carbonated drinks, means the purchasing decisions of Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) can significantly impact global sugar prices.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) offers over 500 brands in more than 200 countries and territories. As a major producer of sugar-sweetened beverages, the company's sugar procurement strategy and demand heavily influence global sugar prices and market trends. Likewise, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has multiple well-known brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade, among many others. So naturally, the company is one of the largest purchasers of sugar in the world.Apart from the beverage industry, the confectionery industry also heavily relies on raw sugar. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the owner company of brands like Cadbury and Oreo, is a big stakeholder in the market. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) reported net revenues of $31.496 billion in 2022, 9.6% higher than a year before. It's the well-loved brands like Milka, Trident, and Cadbury that drive Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) 's high sugar use.The biofuel industry, specifically ethanol production, is another off-taker of raw sugar. Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, channels a substantial portion of its sugarcane crop into ethanol production. As a result, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) are stakeholders in the sugar market. The rising demand for biofuels could stimulate increased sugar production and potentially higher prices.Let's now list the top countries in sugar industry.20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar20 Countries That Produce the Most SugarOur Methodology We ranked the top 20 sugar producing countries according to their raw sugar yield in the crop year 2020/2021. Our source for this study was the Food and Agriculture Organization Of The United Nations (UN FAO). After shortlisting the nations leading in sugar production, we downloaded their raw sugar output stats from the UN FAO database by selecting the indicators of 'production quantity in 2020', as these are the latest records available. Based on our findings, here are the 20 countries that produce the most sugar:20. UkraineAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.17 million metric tonsUkraine is a top player in the global sugar market, and beet sugar is the main type produced. The country was estimated to produce approximately 1.17 million metric tons of sugar in the 2020/2021 crop year. A large part of Ukraine's agricultural sector is devoted to sugar beet cultivation because of its fertile soil conditions and favorable climate. Major regions for sugar beet cultivation include Poltava, Vinnytsia, and Khmelnytskyi. 19. IranAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.56 million metric tonsIran's sugar production primarily revolves around two crops: sugar beets and sugarcane. In 2020/21 crop year, the country produced over 1.56 million tonnes of sugar annually. Sugar beets are grown in the country's colder north, while sugarcane thrives in the hot and humid southern region. Sadly, Iran has been grappling with a water shortage that impacts sugar production. 18. ArgentinaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 1.80 million metric tonsArgentina is renowned for its fertile Pampas grassland and has a long history of harvesting sugarcane. As a result, it sits amongst countries that produce the most sugar, with annual production exceeding 1.8 million tonnes. The subtropical provinces of Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy are Argentina's main sugarcane cultivation areas, as they benefit from adequate rainfall and warmth. The Argentine sugar industry is heavily mechanized, focusing on producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative energy source.17. South AfricaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.10 million metric tonsSouth Africa's sugar industry is predominantly based in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces. The country ranks amongst 20 countries that produce the most sugar, owing to its around 24,000 registered sugarcane growers. South Africa cultivates about 19-20 million tonnes of sugarcane annually, then processed in 14 mills nationwide. Sugar production provides employment opportunities and facilitates infrastructural development. 16. IndonesiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.123 million metric tonsIndonesia is one of the countries that produce the most sugar. It is also the fifth-largest sugar consumer in Asia; the country's sugar industry is centered in Java, where the climate favors sugarcane cultivation. However, regardless of its vast cultivation areas, Indonesia's sugar production is often insufficient to meet its domestic demand as there are inefficiencies in farming and processing. 15. PhilippinesAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.125 million metric tonsIn the Philippines, sugar production is a vital industry supporting over five million people directly or indirectly. The country produces an average of 2.12 million metric tons of sugar annually, catering mostly to domestic consumption. The Philippines' sugar industry also significantly contributes to bioethanol production, as the Biofuels Act of 2006 mandates a minimum bioethanol blend in gasoline. 14. ColombiaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.21 million metric tonsColombia produces approximately 2.2 million tons of sugar per year, and sugarcane is a significant cash crop. Much of this output is used for domestic consumption, while a sizable portion is converted into ethanol for biofuel.13. GuatemalaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.65 million metric tonsGuatemala is one of the world's top sugar exporters, producing around 2.65 million tons of sugar annually. It's worth noting that the sector is heavily invested in modern technologies for irrigation, production, and energy co-generation from sugar cane waste.12. TurkeyAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.79 million metric tonsTurkey's sugar production is heavily based on sugar beet and has seen a shift due to governmental agricultural policies. Traditionally, state-run sugar factories dominated the industry, but liberalization since 2018 has allowed private enterprises to contribute significantly to the production. Turkey produced around 2.79 million tons of sugar during the last crop year, but its dependence on sugar imports to meet its domestic consumption needs signifies a production-demand gap. 11. EgyptAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 2.9 million metric tonsEgypt is among the top sugar-producing nations in Africa, as its annual production reaches almost 3 million tons. The sugar industry in Egypt has taken strides toward modernization and has invested significantly in upgrading machinery and refining processes. The government has also been working to ensure self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on imported sugar.10. FranceAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 3.8 million metric tonsFrance is one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe, particularly of sugar beets, as they are well-suited to its temperate climate. The country's annual sugar production is 3.8 million tons, owing to its sugar beet yield. France has high-yielding sugar beet varieties, and its efficient, modern sugar refineries make the most of this crop. France's sugar industry also takes a sustainable approach as many producers use beet pulp and molasses, byproducts of sugar production, to make biofuels and animal feed.9. AustraliaAnnual Raw Sugar Production: 4.33 million metric tonsAustralia's Queensland and New South Wales areas boast a thriving sugar industry centered around sugar cane production. The nation produced over 4.33 million tons of raw sugar in 2020/2021 and became one of the largest sugar producing countries. Most Australian sugar farms are often located in coastal areas and make use of the tropical climate that is necessary for sugar cane growth. Click to continue reading 8 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar.Suggested Articles:15 Countries That Produce the Most Corn20 Countries That Produce the Most Wheat11 Best Sugar Stocks To BuyDisclosure: None. 20 Countries That Produce the Most Sugar is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The S&amp;P 500 Industrial Index generated returns of about 19.30% over the past year, whereas the broad market index has garnered 12.77% over the past year (as of Jul 27).After all, better-than-expected U.S. economic growth can result in increased business investment, infrastructure spending, and higher demand for durable goods, benefiting industrial companies. Manufacturing companies expect positive business sentiment for the second half of 2023, with automation adoption expected to boost industrial activities.Against this backdrop, below we highlight Q2 earnings results of a few renowned U.S. industrial players. Results have been mixed so far. Let’s delve a little deeper.Inside Q2 EarningsGeneral ElectricOn Jul 25, General Electric GE reported its second-quarter 2023 results. GE posted upbeat earnings due to strong demand for jet engine spare parts and services. GE currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A (as of Jul 27).The conglomerate reported adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share. However, there was a 12.8% decrease in the bottom line compared to the previous year. On the revenue front, the company generated a total of $15,861 million, which exceeded the consensus estimate of $15,085 million. This represented a notable 14.9% increase in the top line compared to the previous year.3M3M MMM reported its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 24. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, assisted by increased prices and implemented cost-saving measures. 3M currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), along with a Growth and VGM Score of A (as of Jul 27).MMM reported adjusted earnings (excluding $14.52 from non-recurring items) of $2.17 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65.

However, the top line declined 4.3% year over year.Story continuesHoneywell InternationalHoneywell International HON reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 earnings before market open on Jul 27, supported by a strong performance in the aviation market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2, along with a Momentum Score of A (as of Jul 27).The conglomerate reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.23 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20. The bottom line increased 6.2% year over year. However, total revenues of $9,146 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,171 million. The top line inched up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter, due to growth in commercial aerospace, process solutions and UOP business.Union PacificOn Jul 26, Union Pacific UNP reported second quarter 2023 earnings, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues, lower volumes and an unfavorable business mix. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), along with a Growth Score of B (as of Jul 27).Union Pacific reported earnings of $2.57 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75.

A telemedicine doctor will review the purchase to ensure it is medically necessary and place an order on their behalf. Patients can review their results online and have the option to speak to a physician at no extra cost.If the test is positive, individuals automatically will be contacted by a doctor from an independent physician network to discuss the next steps and potentially can share the results with other physicians, the company said.Dr. Sarah Kremen, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, was concerned that people who test positive but have no symptoms will come in seeking further testing, possibly in hopes of accessing new treatments. But they will not qualify for more testing if they are not symptomatic.Racke said such individuals may still benefit from lifestyle interventions, such as dieting and exercise, to reduce their risk or delay the onset of symptoms. They may also qualify for Alzheimer's trials studying treatments in at-risk individuals who are still cognitively normal.Quest's lab-developed test, created and performed in a single laboratory, has not undergone any FDA review. The agency generally does not review such tests as long as they are prescribed by a healthcare provider. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Richard Chang and Bill Berkrot)]"

Data from PitchBook pegged the company's valuation at $395 million in 2020.San Jose-based Nile provides network-as-a-service (NaaS) solution focusing on secure wired and wireless products, offering an alternative in building corporate Wi-Fi, which has been dominated by players including Cisco, Juniper Networks, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Aruba Wireless.Since its technology became available last May, Nile has signed customers such as Stanford University and startup Carta.Pankaj Patel, chief executive at Nile, said the young company can challenge the incumbents by offering ease of use at lower cost and advanced security features in its network.Nile’s services-only offering could save clients 30% to 50% at each location, partly because it is a consumption-based model, so users don't have to pay upfront fees on equipment or spend on maintenance, Patel claims.""We really equate this very much like a utility, that customers are really looking for something which is invisible.

By adding recovery to the response process, Cisco XDR is redefining what customers should expect from security products. Today's announcement brings near real-time recovery for business operations after a ransomware attack.Cisco Logo Cisco continues to drive momentum towards its vision of the Cisco Security Cloud—a unified, AI-driven, cross-domain security platform. With the launch of Cisco XDR at the RSA Conference this year, Cisco delivered deep telemetry and unmatched visibility across the network and endpoints. Now, by reducing the crucial time between the beginnings of a ransomware outbreak and capturing a snapshot of business-critical information to near-zero, Cisco XDR will further support that vision, while enabling new levels of business continuity.""The exponential growth of ransomware and cyber extortion has made a platform approach crucial to effectively counter adversaries. Our objective is to build a resilient and open cybersecurity platform that can withstand ransomware assaults and recover with minimal impact, ensuring uninterrupted business operations,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. ""As a global infrastructure provider that built the network, Cisco is redefining what a security product should deliver. Our innovations with automated ransomware recovery are a significant step towards achieving truly unified detection and response data, turning security insights into action.""Story continuesDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Cisco Talos Incident Response (IR) team responded to the highest number of ransomware engagements in more than a year. With the new capabilities in Cisco XDR, Security Operations Center (SOC) teams will be able to automatically detect, snapshot, and restore the business-critical data at the very first signs of a ransomware attack, often before it moves laterally through the network to reach high-value assets.""Cisco is quickly disrupting the security landscape across their entire portfolio and their XDR solution could become the de facto reference architecture organizations turn to,"" said Chris Konrad, Area Vice President, Global Cyber, World Wide Technology. ""Not only does it provide broad visibility by integrating data across endpoints, network, cloud, and other sources - this extensive attack surface insight allows for superior threat detection using advanced analytics. Organizations should strongly consider the implementation of Cisco XDR to bolster their security posture and safeguard assets effectively. Cisco undoubtedly is contributing to the overall resilience of any organization.""Cisco is expanding its initially released, extensive set of third-party XDR integrations to include leading infrastructure and enterprise data backup and recovery vendors. Today, Cisco is excited to announce the first integration of this kind with Cohesity's DataProtect and DataHawk solutions.""Cybersecurity is a board-level concern, and every CIO and CISO is under pressure to reduce risks posed by threat actors. To this end, Cisco and Cohesity have partnered to help enterprises around the world strengthen their cyber resilience,"" said Sanjay Poonen, CEO and President, Cohesity. ""Our first-of-its-kind proactive response is a key piece of our data security and management vision, and we're excited to bring these capabilities to market first with Cisco.""Cohesity has a proven track record of innovation in data backup and recovery capabilities. Cohesity's products provide configurable recovery points and mass recovery for systems assigned to a protection plan. The new features take this core functionality to the next level by preserving potentially infected virtual machines for future forensic investigation, while simultaneously protecting data and workloads in the rest of the environment. Cohesity's engineers worked alongside Cisco technical teams to dynamically adapt data protection policies to offer organizations a stronger security posture. This complements Cisco XDR's robust detection, correlation, and integrated response capabilities and will enable customers to benefit from accelerated response for data protection and automated recovery.Cisco XDR is now available globally to simplify security operations in today's hybrid, multi-vendor, multi-threat landscape.

This blog was contributed to by Mizpah Brown-Rich, the co-founder of Joshua's Gift.Of all the concerns that parents of autistic children face, a scary encounter with police shouldn't be one of them. But that's exactly what Joshua's parents dealt with, following a walk around the block with their son Joshua to help calm his anxiety.At the time, Joshua was 17 years old, 6-feet tall, African American, and non-verbal. Joshua interacted with the world around him a little differently than others.When a neighborhood resident called the police for what they mistook as ""suspicious behavior"", the resulting response could have easily escalated into a dangerous situation.The experience inspired Joshua's parents to take bold action to help ensure that police, security personnel, and first responders could learn how to identify autistic individuals and respond with skill and compassion.Joshua's mother Mizpah Brown-Rich and father Kerry Rich developed CODE JOSHUA - a unique call for emergency assistance that alerts police officers, firefighters, health care workers, and other personnel to respectfully approach and respond to autistic individuals in crisis with sensitivity and caution. The initiative is one of many innovations and services within their non-profit organization Joshua's Gift, which works to develop a society that invitingly accepts, respects, and includes the autistic community.According to Autismspectrumnews.org, caregivers report 13% of their autistic children used at least one emergency service in a two-month period, and 20% of autistic children have had encounters with law enforcement officers by the age of 2. By creating an alliance with first responders, CODE JOSHUA drives equal rights, protects and defends our most vulnerable citizens, and preserves individual freedoms.Cisco's Connected Black Professionals (CBP) Inclusive Community recognized the power and potential of CODE JOSHUA and the alignment with our social justice action committed to supporting key organizations in shaping social justice policy and driving equal rights. CBP nominated the innovative program for Cisco's Black Equity Grant program, which awards a total of US $500,000 in cash grants each fiscal year to Black-serving and/or Black-led nonprofit organizations who support social justice and racial equity.As Curshanda Cusseaux Woods, Black Equity Grant program administrator, puts it, ""Joshua's Gift is a wonderful example of the types of organizations we love to support. They align with our social justice values and have the vision and the know how to institute change. They just needed support from Cisco to further their impact in more communities.""With Cisco's funding, support, and community partnership, CODE JOSHUA was established into a robust registry database. Profiles created by the families of autistic individuals detail key information and crisis behaviors to help guide 911 dispatchers in appropriate crisis response. The initiative includes a training program and video resources to train first responders on how to approach with empathy and patience, how to de-escalate the situation by meeting the individuals' sensory and communication needs, and how to respond without force.To date, CODE JOSHUA has been launched in police departments in multiple Northern California counties.Joshua's mother Mizpah is seeing real impact. ""Our CODE JOSHUA training courses are having an impressive impact on the first responders we are training. The program is effectively helping minimize anxiety and eliminate potential harm to our loved ones living with autism and IDD (Intellectual Developmental Disabilities). ""By partnering with Cisco, we can leverage their technology and expertise to reach more communities and raise awareness about our autistic citizens. Together, we are making a difference in saving lives and creating a more inclusive and respectful society.""Learn more about CODE JOSHUA and the Joshua's Gift organization.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Monday, July 31, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/771206/Cisco-How-an-Initiative-Developed-by-a-Nonprofit-Helps-First-Responders-Respond-to-the-Autistic-Community]"
