If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of social security realities and financial strategies, you may go to 10 US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2000 a Month.', 'What does $1,907 buy in a month? Considering this is the amount on average that a retiree gets from Social Security in 2024, chances are not much. The Bureau of Labor Statistics crunched out the exact figures, stating that the average spending for those aged 65 or older was $4,345 monthly as of 2021. For 44% of these seniors, food costs were the fastest-growing expense for the year, and only 48% of those surveyed managed to keep their overall expenses under $2,000. While numerous retirees aim to minimize their expenses in anticipation of unforeseen costs in the future, for a substantial portion of retirees, this is not a matter of choice. Data from the Federal Reserve further sheds light on this, quoting that 43% of those aged 55- to 64 had no retirement savings at all as of 2022. Their only hope? Social Security retirement benefits.', 'However, saving money for retirement isn’t everyone’s cup of tea . Many get caught up in a “financial vortex”, as revealed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).', '“Only 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority”.', '- Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).', ""While saving for retirement is an absolute must, there are three key risks associated with these savings. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) notes that savers are faced with a “complex financial backdrop” when saving up money for retirement. More so, there are risks associated with these savings. These are inflation, longevity, and market decline. There is always the risk of rising inflation that will eventually erode the value of your nest egg, the risk that you'll outlive your savings, and even the danger of a downturn that could eventually compromise long-term savings."", ""So Social Security benefits are the only reliable money that is going to be there for you. Sadly, they are not enough. More importantly, they are all set to be depleted by 2034, leaving potential retirees wondering whether these benefits are even going to be there for them or not. According to the Social Security Administration, even if trust funds do get depleted, some benefits could still be paid. This is because even in the scenario of complete reserve depletion, the anticipated annual income from the trust funds is expected to cover approximately 79% of the program's total cost."", '""What I tell clients is, \'It will be there for you—but there may be some changes. That could mean later retirement dates for future recipients, reduced benefits for retirees who can afford it, or increases to the Social Security payroll tax in order to raise more money"".', '- Robert Aruldoss, a senior financial planning analyst at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)', 'Further, this is what Mike Townsend from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has to say about the future of Social Security:', '“From a beneficiary\'s perspective, any proposed solution likely would be phased in over many years—and people approaching or already in retirement would almost certainly be exempt. After all, many Americans have been planning their retirement with certain assumptions around Social Security in mind, and it would be unfair to upend those assumptions without adequate time to adjust"".', '-Mike Townsend, managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at Schwab from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)', ""Considering the above financial landscape for retirees, it's only wise for them to learn how to live comfortably on as little as they can. This figure, considering rent, groceries, and utilities are accounted for, comes down to approximately $2,000 a month. So for those wondering is $2,000 a month good for retirement? The answer largely depends on where you end up retiring to."", 'Nagel Photography/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile our list of 29 US cities where you can retire on $2000 a month, we updated our previous list on 25 US cities where you can retire on $2000 a month.

Such broad dispersion between volatility at the index level and volatility of individual stocks is pretty unusual, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Schwab, who authored the report along with his colleague, Liz Ann Sonders.', '“This behavior is not typical of a bull market,” Gordon said during a phone interview with MarketWatch. “But at the same time, this is not a typical cycle.”', 'In fact, a bull might not be the best animal to capture the essence of the current market, according to Sonders.', '“The reality is the stock market is acting a little more like a duck than a bull: calm on the surface but paddling like the dickens underneath,” she said in the report.', 'This discrepancy is even greater for the Nasdaq Composite COMP: the tech-heavy index has seen a maximum drawdown of just 3% this year, while the average Nasdaq stock has fallen 23% from peak to trough.', 'This applies also if one measures performance since Oct. 12, 2022, the day the bull market began. Since then, the S&P 500 has risen 43% through Wednesday’s close with a maximum drawdown of 10%. Meanwhile, the average index stock has seen a pullback of 26%, as the chart below shows.', 'Similar patterns can be observed for the small-cap Russell 2000 RUT and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA.', 'The difference between volatility at the index level and volatility for individual stocks is indicative of what has become a lopsided market, Gordon said, where a handful of stocks mask the relatively weak performance of many of the index’s constituents.', 'Roughly half of the issues in the S&P 500 are trading below their levels from January 2022, while roughly 10% of the individual stocks in the index have outperformed it over the past year — an historically low percentage at this point in a bull market.', '“Typically, more than a year into a bull market, you see a much higher percentage of companies that have taken out their prior highs,” Gordon said.', 'Fortunately for investors who favor index-tracking funds, the dramatic outperformance of a handful of the largest U.S.-traded stocks has more than compensated for weakness elsewhere. A group of seven megacap stocks known as the Magnificent Seven drove the bulk of the S&P 500’s 24% advance in 2023, according to FactSet data.', 'Although several members of this group have lagged since the beginning of 2024, explosive gains by Nvidia Corp.

The share of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average has also proved to be a reliable leading indicator of trouble ahead in the past.', 'For example, participation started to decline in late 2021, a few months before the S&P 500 peaked in early January 2022. A similar dynamic played out before COVID-19 upended markets in March 2020.', 'Right now, breadth appears to be slowly improving.

This takes the annual payment to 1.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Flowserve ', ""While it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, Flowserve's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 133.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 25% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.56 total annually to $0.84. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.1% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.', ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Flowserve has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing."", 'Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Flowserve is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship.

There's considerable prestige associated within militaries with the warrior elite! These are top-notch units of the armed forces made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country to perform special operations. What sets these operators apart from the rest is their high level of rigorous training and strong personality traits including bravery and resilient mentality."", 'While historically, special forces worked in small units and were only called in for critical missions, over time, their role has expanded throughout the world, especially because of the global war on terror. Special forces in the US for example under the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) grew from 38,000 personnel before the 2001 9/11 attacks to 73,000 by 2020, with their budget also seeing a 495% spike from $2.3 billion to $13.7 billion during this period.', 'Considering the complex challenges these forces undertake, the US military is equipping their special forces operators with sophisticated equipment to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced in July 2023 that its Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) had achieved initial operational capability – a project it had been working on for decades.', 'Two DCSs have been provided to the Navy by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), with work ongoing on the third. According to the company, these submersibles will provide the Navy SEALs the ability to travel well below the surface of the ocean without wetsuits and get in and out of the vehicles undetected while being entirely submerged. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is a key industrial partner of the American special forces, and also the primary contractor for SOCOM’s logistics and sustainment support program.', 'The US Navy is aggressively ramping up its seabed capabilities as well. According to a report, the Navy, with an eye on protecting assets deep in the ocean, has commissioned a next-generation attack submarine, work on which is already underway at the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). The submarine will be used for the Navy SEALs to perform covert operations along the floor of the operation to tap deep sea communication cables and retrieve parts of missiles and rockets tested underwater.', 'SOCOM is also upgrading its MH-47G Chinook fleet as part of the aircraft’s modernization efforts. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in December 2023 received a $271 million modification contract, under which it will procure the MH-47G rotary wing renewal build aircraft for SOCOM. The company expects to complete work on the project, which would involve delivering six helicopters, by May 2027. Earlier that year in March, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) secured a $18 million task order for the acquisition of components and parts for the aircraft. MH-47G Chinook, first introduced in 1962 by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), continues to be widely used in American special operations despite aging.', 'On the other hand, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), between 2016 and 2021, under a five-year contract with a maximum ceiling of $900 million provided professional services to US special forces in their global operations. The services included technical and engineering work for major weapon systems, and assistance with decision-making related to production and program control. Work on the agreement was carried out by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s subsidiary, ARMA Global.', 'Getmilitaryphotos/Shutterstock.com', 'Several credible publications and news reports available on the internet have been consolidated to identify countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world.

The KSK is the elite special force of the German military or Bundeswehr. It is a large brigade-level unit that has expertise in search and rescue, commando warfare, and anti-terrorism. The KSK carried out multiple successful special operations in Afghanistan, and is considered one of the most well-equipped special forces in the world.', 'The Kommando Spezialkräfte Marine (KSM) is the special forces group of the German Navy that is responsible for carrying out amphibious warfare. Both of these groups require their deployments to be authorized by the German parliament before they can undertake any operation.', 'Special Forces: 3', 'Next up on our list of countries with the highest number of military special forces in the world is Spain, with three major special operations groups. We begin with the Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial, or the Special Naval Warfare Force, which is the special operations unit of the Spanish Navy. It mainly comprises the members of the Marines, and specializes in operations in land, sea, and air. The Unidad de Operaciones Especiales, which is regarded as one of the best special forces in the world, merged into the Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial in 2009, with the latter inheriting the former’s reputation.', 'Moving on now to Escuadrón de Zapadores Paracaidistas (EZAPAC), which is the special forces unit of Spain’s elite paratroopers, and works under the Spanish Air Force. Commandos joining the group go through rigorous training in parachuting, skiing, weapon handling, SATCOM transmission, survival, and other critical areas related to aerial special operations.', 'Lastly, commandos of the Caballero Legionario Maderal Oleaga or 19th Special Operations Group, are capable of maritime and mountain warfare, counter-terrorism, and sabotage.\xa0', 'Special Forces: 3', 'Pakistan’s Special Services Group, or SSG, is among the best military special forces in the world. Due to the unique headgear worn by its commandos, it is also often referred to as the Black Storks. The SSG is a battle-hardened force that has undertaken several successful operations, especially in the restive tribal north against militant groups along the border with Afghanistan. The group has expertise in search and rescue, hostage rescue, psychological operations, direct action, reconnaissance, and taking out high-value targets.', 'The country’s navy also has a special forces group with the same name – the Pakistan Navy Special Service Group, which is also often called the Navy SEALs and Navy SSG. This unit is capable of carrying out unconventional special operations at land, air and sea.', 'On the other hand, the Special Services Wing is the special operations branch of the Pakistan Air Force, whose personnel are trained to perform special missions related to reconnaissance, combat control, pararescue, offensive raiding, and direct action. These commandos are primarily responsible for air traffic control in hostile environments.', 'Special Forces: 3', 'The Commandement des Opérations Spéciales, or the Special Operations Command (COS), in France is equivalent to the USSOCOM and UKSF, and oversees the operations of various special forces of the French military. The National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, or GIGN, is the most prominent special operations unit in France that is responsible for counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and the protection of VIPs in the country. According to a report in The Independent, the GIGN has freed up over 600 hostages since it was unveiled in 1973.', 'Another potent military special force is the Commandos Marine, which works under the French Navy. The personnel in this unit are trained to conduct special operations at sea, land, and air to defend France from internal and external threats. Intelligence gathering, underwater operations, counter-terrorism, and hostage rescue are areas of strength for the Commandos Marine.', 'The French Air and Space Force also has a special forces group in Air Parachute Commando No. 10, with expertise in reconnaissance, aerial guidance, counter-terrorism, and combat search and rescue.', 'Special Forces: 4', 'The Canadian Special Operations Forces Command is responsible for all special operations conducted by the country to respond to terrorism, as well as threats to Canada.

For 2023, the company had cash inflow from operating activities worth $4.71 billion, up 2.9% from the prior-year tally.Such solid cash balance is likely to have enabled General Dynamics to pay $1.43 billion as dividends to its shareholders in 2023, which reflected an increase of 4.3% from the year-ago amount.It is imperative to mention that the company ended 2023 with a backlog of $93.63 billion, the highest year-end backlog in the company’s history. This reflects that the solid demand for GD’s products is likely to have led to strong order activity, thereby boosting its long-term growth expectations.

His daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, was killed that day when the Boeing 737 Max 8 she was on plunged into the ground just outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, six minutes after the plane took off. She was 24 years old.', '“Part of our life is dead. Part of our future is dead,” he told CNN, as the fifth anniversary of the crash approached. “She had it all. She was brilliant. She was the most published student in the Copenhagen School of Public Health. She taught herself to read before she was four. She went to college at 14. She was beautiful, charismatic. Her smile could light up the room. She was very caring. She would have been a star in the world of global health.”', 'Samya Rose\xa0was flying from Ethiopia to Kenya as part of her new job with a health systems development organization. Even though the same jet model had crashed soon after taking off from Indonesia less than six months earlier, aviation authorities around the world had allowed the 737 Max to keep flying with passengers.', 'Michael Stumo said he never gave the plane or his daughter’s flying plans much thought.', '“We didn’t think about air travel. We didn’t pay attention to the airline, the aircraft model,” he said. “We pay hyper attention to planes now. We’d never fly a Max.”', 'The March 10 anniversary is a difficult one for the families of the 157 people on board the Ethiopian jet, because concerns over Boeing’s safety and quality have been in the news so much in the last two months.', 'This year, on January 5, a part of a 737 Max 9 flown by Alaska Airlines blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Fortunately, it was able to land minutes later without any fatalities or serious injuries.', 'A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory and was delivered to Alaska Air less than three months before, all while missing four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. \xa0', 'Boeing has announced steps to improve safety and quality since the incident, including an all-employees safety meeting the week following the blowout, and shutting production at the Max factory for a day later that month to talk further about how to improve safety. But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not satisfied: The regulator gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to deal with safety gaps.', 'Some of the families of the Ethiopian crash victims welcomed the intense regulatory scrutiny on Boeing following January’s door plug blowout.', '“It’s not that we’re happy that it happened. But it’s a mixed blessing. Something bad was going to happen, but in this case, nobody died,” Stumo said. “With our crash it was focus on the design. It wasn’t on the production chaos. The production problems really came to the fore this time.”', 'Zipporah Kuria, 28, who lost her 55-year-old father, Joseph, on the same flight, said her entire life was uprooted by the crash.', '“I think my initial impression, what an unfortunate accident,” she recalled about the 2019 crash. “Then when I heard later that day this is not the first of these accidents, and that both were relatively new planes, my mind went to ‘something’s not right.’”', 'Like Stumo, she became involved with trying to hold Boeing accountable for its failures, spending hours every week on the issue, reaching out to aviation regulators, speaking out publicly, and trying to bring more public attention to Boeing’s production and safety problems.', '“It’s robbed me of time and opportunity and peace of mind, and most importantly, my dad,” she said this past week. “I haven’t had the capacity to fall in love and build a life with somebody else because this has been the center of my life. When I think ‘I’m going to focus on other parts of my life now,’ a door falls off a plane and we’re back in the Boeing circus.”', 'But like Stumo, Kruia says she is pleased that the Alaska Air incident has brought attention to the fact that the problems at Boeing were not fixed when the 737 Max planes returned to service after the 20-month grounding. Boeing’s production problems went beyond the design flaw that led to the crashes.', 'The company, for five years, has faced repeated quality and potential safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others. But the problems, including de-icing equipment that could fail on 737 and 787 Dreamliner planes, engine issues for the 777 and repeated quality control concerns for the 787’s fuselage, failed to capture much attention from the public. The frightening door plug incident, however, shined a spotlight on the years of safety concerns at the company.', '“When that happened, and everyone on the plane was fine, there was a relief,” Kuria said. “This is the smoking gun we’ve been waiting for the world to see, to wake up and have Boeing be exposed.”', 'The victims’ families, and the attorney who has represented many of them, are particularly angry that the Max continued to fly after the first accident demonstrated a design flaw, a problem with a single sensor that would push the nose of the jet down if it sensed an imminent stall.', 'Boeing continued to insist that the plane was safe, not only after the first crash but for days after the second crash. Boeing only later admitted to the design flaw as part of the investigations and lawsuits that disclosed internal discussions about the problems with the design soon after the first crash.', '“Within days of the first crash, Boeing knew there was a design defect,” Robert Clifford, one of the plaintiff attorneys in the case, told CNN. “Rather than alert all the operators about this defect, they believed they could get ahead of the curve. That’s not what happened. They gambled with people’s lives and the people lost.”', 'In 2021 Boeing admitted to liability in the two crashes, agreeing to pay compensatory damages, which allowed the company to avoid the possibility of having to pay far more in punitive damages.', 'It also agreed to a controversial deferred prosecution agreement with the US Justice Department on charges that it defrauded the FAA when getting the original certification for the Max. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of the settlement – but most of that money was paid to the airlines as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the jets. Those were payments that Boeing had already agreed to make.', 'Since the Alaska Air incident the Justice Department has started reviewing whether deficiencies found in the wake of the door plug blowout on a 737 Max flight violate that deferred prosecution agreement, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The results of the probe could subject Boeing to criminal liability, depending on its outcome.', 'Boeing acknowledged in a January regulatory filing that the Justice Department was looking at whether it had fulfilled the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, but the company told CNN it had no further comment on the latest Justice Department probe.', 'But beyond the many probes and audits and investigations of Boeing, many family members are still angry that the jet was allowed to start flying again after the company made changes to that system after a 20-month grounding. They say the Alaska Air incident demonstrates the problems at Boeing go much deeper than the design issue that was fixed. Some say they extend to production issues and to severe problems in the organizational structure at Boeing. The company declined to comment.', 'Boeing’s CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged at a companywide safety meeting that the company made a mistake with the door plug blowout and the company has pledged to improve safety. Last month, Boeing removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its 737 Max passenger jet program.', 'Since the Alaska Air incident, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report that had been in the works for more than a year, sharply critical of the safety culture at Boeing. Despite statements from Boeing management about a renewed commitment to safety, the FAA found “safety-related messages or behaviors are not being implemented across the entire Boeing population.”', 'The panel, which conducted more than 250 interviews and reviewed more than 4,000 pages of documents, found that among Boeing employees there was a “hesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation” because of management conflicts of interest. The report also said confusion about the safety programs “may discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.”', 'A separate FAA follow-up report focused on the Alaska Air incident and found multiple problems with Boeing’s production practices. The agency has given Boeing 90 days to produce the plan to fix its quality issues.', 'Boeing insists it is making a renewed commitment to safety and fixing production problems, and that the company is working to satisfy the concerns expressed by the FAA. Asked for a comment on the fifth anniversary of the Ethiopian crash, the company responded, “We will never forget the lives lost on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and their loved ones. Their memory and the hard lessons we learned from these accidents drive us every day to uphold our responsibility to all who depend on the safety and quality of our products.”', 'But the victims’ families are hardly satisfied with that statement or other apologies issued by Boeing and its executives over the last five years. They say they won’t stop pushing for changes at Boeing until the top management at the company is replaced.', '“The blame lies with Boeing management. Until David Calhoun and Chief ‘Safety’ Officer Mike Delaney are gone, it won’t change,” Stumo said. “It’s a swampy cesspool.”', 'Stumo and some other family members of victims met with previous Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in 2019 after he testified about the crashes in Washington. Asked if he would like to meet with Calhoun, Stumo paused for a long moment before responding, “I’m not sure.”', 'But Kuria said she’d like to meet with Calhoun and other Boeing executives.', '“Just to find out how these people sleep at night,” she said. “How do you kiss your children and hug your wife knowing there’s a group of families never get to do that because of the decisions made.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

DOJ did not immediately reply to a request for comment.', 'The Journal reported that the investigation would assist the Department’s review of whether Boeing complied with a previous settlement that resolved a federal investigation into the safety of its 737 Max aircraft following two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.', 'In 2021, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including a $244 million fine, to settle an investigation into the crashes of flights operated by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.

Until the hearing, it said, “Boeing was not aware of any complaints or concerns about a lack of collaboration.”"", 'In a preliminary report last month, the NTSB said four bolts that help keep the door plug in place were missing after the panel was removed so workers could repair nearby damaged rivets last September. The rivet repairs were done by contractors working for Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, but the NTSB still does not know who removed and replaced the door panel, Homendy said Wednesday.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration recently gave Boeing 90 days to say how it will respond to quality-control issues raised by the agency and a panel of industry and government experts.

This alarmingly high number has raised many concerns amongst global leaders and local communities to strictly call for fixing the so-called “throwaway culture.”\xa0', 'The throwaway culture is at large illuminated by industries that produce and dump substantial waste material into the soil, which increases land waste and also causes soil pollution. Similarly, the use of pesticides and nitrogen-based fertilizers in the agriculture industry and urbanization are also significantly contributing to soil pollution. Unfortunately, the efforts of just one country or a group of countries are not enough to fix this issue — a global problem requires a global solution. However, waste materials are not efficiently recycled, reused, or properly disposed of in many parts of the world despite the staggering statistics. Waste keeps piling up on the land, especially in low-income countries.', 'Other forms of pollution are also peaking, like air pollution. Each year, around 7 million premature deaths occur due to the effects of ambient and household air pollution, WHO reports.\xa0', 'Even worse is the fact that around 2.4 billion people worldwide are already exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. In the United States, according to the American Lung Association’s 2023 report, 119.6 million people live in places with unhealthy levels of air quality. As a result, people are prone to multiple health issues, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, and other long-term health issues like cancer. It’s important to note that air quality deteriorates as a result of overall pollution, and not just air pollution.\xa0', 'Air quality is measured and monitored using sensors that are designed to detect specific pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide — those that impact human and environmental health overall. There are different methods of measuring these pollutants; some use satellite imaging to measure energy reflected or emitted by the Earth, while others use lasers to scan particulate matter density in a cubic meter of air.\xa0', 'The results are recorded on an air quality index (AQI), which is a scale ranging from 0 to 500 to measure the density of pollutants in the air. The higher the AQI score, the lesser the air quality. Air quality is unhealthy when it scores above 100 on the AQI.

By 2035, JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ: JBLU) is committed to reducing jet fuel emissions by 50% per tonne-kilometer.', 'Similarly, Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is also aiming to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) has invested nearly $100 million in over 30 climate change and environmental sustainability projects. Moreover, its subsidiary company, Disney Cruise Line, has integrated its newest fleets with technologies and systems that improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.', 'On the other hand, by 2040, General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) aims to achieve carbon neutrality in global products and operations. In order to achieve this goal, General Motors Co (NYSE: GM) has set milestones and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-approved targets.

If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market."", ""The artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half."", ""This surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively."", ""Yet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024."", ""Before we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

This week: Nearshoring boom bringing more production closer to US; Mexican and US officials sign agreement to expand international bridge; Old Dominion Freight Line receives approval for new terminal near Phoenix; and construction begins for 785,000-square-foot logistics park in Houston.', 'Mexico registered a record $36 billion in foreign direct investment last year, a 2% year-over-year increase compared to 2022, according to data from the country’s Economy Ministry.', 'Nearshoring — the relocation of production and manufacturing operations from one country to another to be closer to end consumers — has been fueling manufacturing growth across Mexico as shippers look for supply chains that are closer, cheaper and more favorable to doing business with the U.S.', 'Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson’s vice president of North America surface transportation, said he is already seeing the results of the nearshoring of supply chains to Mexico.', '“We’re transitioning to a new era now, where we can say the nearshoring boom has officially arrived,” Burkhart said. “The beauty of this is that more is on the way, we still expect this trend to play out more fully over the next five years.”', 'In September, brokerage giant C.H. Robinson opened a 400,000-square-foot cross-border facility in Laredo, Texas. The complex includes 154 dock doors and room for 700 trailers, while expanding the company’s footprint along the U.S.-Mexico border to 1.5 million square feet of logistics space.', '“Last year, Mexico set a record with foreign direct investment, it was about 24% over 2020 and it marked the first time in two decades that the U.S. bought more goods from Mexico than China,”\xa0Burkhart said. “U.S. imports from Mexico are up, while imports from China actually dropped 20%.”', 'Georg Roesch, vice president of direct procurement strategy at JAGGAER, said shippers are always looking for stable, reliable and cost effective supply chains.', 'JAGGAER is a cloud-based procurement technology company. The firm is headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, and has offices around the world.', '“I would say right now, there is a good and bad in the global supply chain at the same time,” Roesch told FreightWaves. “What we’re seeing is companies learning from situations that we had, such as when COVID totally hit us, companies were like, ‘Oh my God, nothing is working anymore.’ So companies learn from that, and they build up resilience.”', 'Roesch said while shippers were recovering and learning from their experiences during the pandemic, other global incidents and conflicts began to disrupt supply chains over the last two years.', '“There’s a lot going on and the longer these situations last, the harder it will get to circumvent them, the [Houthi attacks on merchant ships] in the Red Sea is one of these examples,” Roesch said. “The longer it drags on, the more problematic it gets for various different reasons, because freight takes longer, it has higher carbon emissions associated with it. So there’s a lot of different things that are impacted by this. Generally, I would say I’m still positive that we’ve learned from our mistakes that we made pre-COVID.”', 'Another sign that nearshoring is growing in Mexico is that the country’s industrial parks expect to receive 453 new companies by mid-2025, 20% of which are from firms based in China, according to a study from BBVA Research and the Mexican Association of Private Industrial Parks.', 'Roesch said JAGGAER is seeing shippers looking for supply chains outside of China and other Asian countries, but are not completely abandoning China.', '“I see a spike in companies trying to find new sources, companies are actively trying to find different suppliers,” Roesch said. “It’s not that companies don’t look into China anymore, they still do, they are still trying to find suppliers in China, but the number is stagnant. We are seeing an uptick in other regions and other areas as supply chains shift. This is the nearshoring and friendshoring and all of these types of efforts. Resilience doesn’t mean risk avoidance, it means to be able to cope with the risks that are out there.”', 'C.H. Robinson has helped manufacturers physically move entire production lines from Asia and Europe to Mexico, Burkhart said.', 'Burkhart also said that 2024 may be the first year ocean container volumes also shift due to nearshoring, as more companies bring in machinery, equipment, parts and raw materials to get operations running in Mexico.', '“It’s not just Asian or overseas companies that we’re seeing, we’re still seeing huge expansion with U.S. companies that are expanding in Mexico because of the United-States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement providing stability and cost savings through 2046,” Burkhart said. “We have customers, especially in the automotive sector, that treat the whole continent as one integrated supply chain. We move a lot between Canada and Mexico, and that seems to be growing as well. So whether it’s intermodal, whether it’s truckload, whether it’s consolidation, whether it’s less-than-truckload, we’re seeing much more intercontinental movements.”', 'The mayor of Laredo, Texas, and the governor of the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon recently signed an agreement to expand the Colombia Solidarity International Bridge in Laredo.', 'The agreement between Laredo Mayor Victor Trevino and Nuevo Leon Gov. Samuel aims to increase the bridge from eight lanes to 16 lanes. The bridge is a key border truck crossing that connects the state of Nuevo Leon with Laredo.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!"", ""Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Exelon ', ""We have to calculate the value of Exelon slightly differently to other stocks because it is a electric utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.0%. Compared to the current share price of US$37.0, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$1.7 / (6.0% – 2.3%)', '= US$42.8', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Exelon as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', 'Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

When his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) first began investing in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2016, that stock traded at a steep discount to the market -- with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the range of 10 to 14.5 that year. Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today."", ""A lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500. Combined with Apple, these six companies make up 78.4% of Berkshire's portfolio."", ""Let's consider why Buffett and his team like these companies, and the qualities that make them good long-term holdings."", ""In Berkshire Hathaway's most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett praised his longtime partner Charlie Munger for many things, including a key lesson he taught Buffett."", 'Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: ""Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.""', 'Back then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.', ""Berkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift. Apple is the undisputed leader in smartphones, consumer electronics, and wearable devices, and offers a wide range of services, many with high margins."", 'Bank of America is the second-largest diversified bank behind JPMorgan Chase.', 'American Express is a top credit card company, along with Mastercard and Visa (which Berkshire also owns shares in).', 'Coca-Cola is the most valuable U.S.-based beverage company.', 'Chevron is the second-biggest U.S.-based oil major, behind ExxonMobil. And Occidental Petroleum, commonly known as Oxy, is one of the most valuable exploration and production companies and, assuming its deal with CrownRock L.P. goes through, will become one of the top producers in the Permian Basin -- the largest onshore oilfield in the U.S.', ""In sum, Berkshire's biggest stock holdings are all among the top dogs in their respective industries. Many of them have another attribute that Buffett loves -- capital return programs."", 'Over the last five years, Apple, Bank of America, and American Express have all boosted their dividends and bought back stock at impressive rates.', 'Coke and Chevron have focused primarily on growing their dividends. Both have increased their payouts by more than 50% in the last 10 years. And Chevron has bought back a boatload of stock over the last two years. In 2023 alone, it spent a record $26 billion on dividends and buybacks.', ""Occidental Petroleum is a bit of an outlier. In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter. It has since raised its quarterly payout several times, bringing it up to $0.22 per share, but it hasn't been exactly the type of consistent dividend payer Berkshire usually targets."", 'Oxy is also known for using debt and leveraging up its balance sheet, which it will do to pay for its pending CrownRock acquisition.', ""In Berkshire's 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett praised Oxy's leadership and wrote of his confidence in the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. Oxy stands out as a specific play on a specific theme. It amounts to 4.1% of the public equity portfolio, indicating that Berkshire is taking care to manage the position to make sure it doesn't become too large."", 'You may be wondering, if these companies all have qualities that make them suitable investments, then why would they trade at a discount to the market? Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.', 'Financial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.', 'As for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei. So its valuation has come under pressure as investors search for companies that are growing in the near term.', ""Berkshire's largest stock holdings showcase its highest-conviction names. Berkshire has owned some of these stocks for decades. Others, like Apple, Chevron, and Oxy, are more recent additions to the portfolio."", 'The key takeaway is that Berkshire knows what it is looking for, and targets companies that fit its criteria -- not simply those that are tied to whichever hot trend is sweeping Wall Street. Berkshire invests in companies that are good values and have attractive capital return programs through dividends and buybacks.', ""As an individual investor, it's important to find the types of companies and sectors you like. It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance. Buffett has often said that Berkshire purposely keeps a massive cash position and is conservative with its investments, but that's because capital preservation and limiting downside risk are integral parts of his philosophy."", 'If you have a high risk tolerance or are multiple decades away from retirement, taking on more risk could make sense for you.

Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\xa0"", ""Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year."", 'The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further.

Back then, sentiment was negative -- there was a widespread view that Apple's growth was plateauing, its market expansion had played out, and its products were limited -- not to mention it didn't have the high-margin services segment it has today."", ""A lot has changed since then. But Apple has once again lost its market premium. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 14.6%, while Apple stock is down 4.9%. On March 1, Apple sold off, and the S&P 500 rose. At one point, Apple's P/E ratio fell below the S&P 500's, but it ended up finishing the day at 27.9, which was, coincidentally, the same as the S&P 500."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's other top public equity holdings -- Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) -- are all trading at discounts to the S&P 500.

But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.""', 'Back then, Buffett was known for buying decent or bad businesses because their book values were higher than their market values. Munger taught Buffett that if he was going to be a great investor managing a larger amount of money, he would have to pivot away from that scrappy strategy toward something more sustainable.', ""Berkshire's top stock holdings today reflect this shift.

In 2020, Oxy cut its dividend from $0.79 per share per quarter to just $0.01 per share per quarter.

Part of the reason is simply the industries that these companies are in.', 'Financial stocks tend to trade at discounts to the market. So do consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola. The oil and natural gas sector is cyclical, so its P/E ratios tend to be low during growth periods and high during downturns. Investors tend to pay a premium for growth companies relative to slower-growing companies, and they tend to favor stability as opposed to cyclicality.', 'As for Apple, it has been largely unaffected by the artificial intelligence-induced tech bull market, and is facing slowing growth out of China and competition from Huawei.

It's also vital to make sure you align your investments with your risk tolerance.

In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\xa0"", ""Among the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year."", 'The United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a ""Goldilocks"" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that General Electric had debt of US$21.0b at the end of December 2023, a reduction from US$24.1b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$20.6b in cash leading to net debt of about US$391.0m.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, General Electric had liabilities of US$50.9b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$83.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$20.6b as well as receivables valued at US$16.5b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$97.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since General Electric has a huge market capitalization of US$182.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution. Carrying virtually no net debt, General Electric has a very light debt load indeed."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', 'General Electric has very little debt (net of cash), and boasts a debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.05 and EBIT of 15.3 times the interest expense. Indeed relative to its earnings its debt load seems light as a feather. Better yet, General Electric grew its EBIT by 147% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if General Electric can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.', 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last two years, General Electric actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.', ""General Electric's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at the bigger picture, we think General Electric's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for General Electric  that you should be aware of."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Just Recorded A 27% EPS Beat: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting Next",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-inc-just-recorded-27-134142320.html,1709991702,STORY,['GPS'],"[""Investors in The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) had a good week, as its shares rose 9.8% to close at US$20.92 following the release of its full-year results. Revenues were US$15b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$1.34, an impressive 27% ahead of estimates. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Gap ', ""Taking into account the latest results, Gap's 19 analysts currently expect revenues in 2025 to be US$14.8b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 2.1% to US$1.33 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$14.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.00 in 2025. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the great increase in earnings per share expectations following these results."", ""The consensus price target rose 9.2% to US$21.06, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Gap, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$28.00 and the most bearish at US$8.00 per share. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Gap's past performance and to peers in the same industry. One thing that stands out from these estimates is that shrinking revenues are expected to moderate over the period ending 2025 compared to the historical decline of 0.9% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 5.2% per year. So while a broad number of companies are forecast to grow, unfortunately Gap is expected to see its revenue affected worse than other companies in the industry."", ""The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Gap's earnings potential next year. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Then I'll pass the call to Katrina to walk you through our detailed financial results as well as our 2024 outlook before we take questions. As a reminder, our four strategic priorities are, first, maintaining and delivering financial and operational rigor; second, the reinvigoration of our brands; third, strengthening our platform; and fourth, energizing our culture. Before I start, I'd like to highlight three recent additions to our leadership team, each of whom will contribute meaningfully to the ongoing execution of our strategic priorities. Eric Chan has joined us as Chief Business and Strategy Officer, Amy Thompson as Chief People Officer, and Zac Posen as Creative Director of Gap, Inc., and Chief Creative Officer of Old Navy."", ""I've been purposeful and thinking about the talent and skill these executives bring and how they complement our existing institutional knowledge. These new leaders will play critical roles in unlocking our full potential and solidifying our foundation as we redefine Gap, Inc., for a new era. One, where our financial and operational rigor is a cornerstone of strength bolstered by best-in-class talent and a culture of creativity, all paving the way for brand reinvigoration and greater cultural relevance. We are pleased with the results of the quarter as we exceed expectations on several key metrics driven by our strategic priorities. Maintaining and delivering financial and operational rigor strengthened our financial footing in 2023, showing that we can drive more efficiency and productivity, enabling us to focus on brand reinvigoration."", ""We've made a lot of progress, delivering cost-savings and gross margin expansion, and this work helped us deliver meaningful improvement in adjusted operating margin of 410 basis points for 2023. Our focus on controlling the controllables also resulted in better working capital and a stronger balance sheet at year end. This includes reducing our inventory levels by 16% year-over-year, building a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion, and generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow. These proof points put us on strong financial footing as we begin 2024. Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrate strong progress, not only in terms of improved margins and well-controlled expenses but also with more stability in net sales. Net sales grew by 1% and comps were flat with Gap Inc., gaining market share."", ""The sequential improvement, which is noteworthy in a declining apparel market reflects the team's responsiveness and nimbleness as we begin our brand reinvigoration work. Old Navy comps increased 2% and we were pleased to gain share in women's for the fourth quarter, building on the success we saw in the third quarter. We are also encouraged that we increased our foothold in two key categories, Active and Bottoms. As the number five player in the active space, we are excited for Old Navy to accelerate in this leading category. The all-important bottoms category creates additional opportunities because it's the gateway to the full wardrobe. Gap brand's comps were up 4% driven by strength in Women's, where we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of market share gains."", ""This result was amplified by good performances in denim and sweaters, supported by new marketing campaigns. Banana Republic comps were down 4% as we conduct deliberate and ongoing work to reestablish the brand and Athleta's comps were down 10% as we lapped a period of heavy discounting that we previewed last quarter, but improved sequentially, driven by new holiday product, updated marketing, and improved in-store presentation. We expanded our company gross margin by 530 basis points, ahead of expectations, driven by more effective sourcing strategies and lower commodity costs combined with improved promotional activities, leaner inventories, and better assortments. We also increased our operating margin by 570 basis points to 5%. Our team is demonstrating the ability to do what we say we're going to do and in some cases even more."", ""However, we're not where we need to be. Our ongoing focus on financial and operational rigor will allow us to continue to elevate our performance, improve execution consistency, and set the foundation for our exciting brand reinvigoration work. Turning to our next priority, brand reinvigoration is about driving both relevance and revenue, inspired by our brand's incredible heritage. As a reminder, this strategic priority begins with strengthening the identities and purpose of each of our brands. We are striving for each brand to have trend-right product assortments rooted in customer-centric design thinking and a clear point-of-view that delivers on both wants and needs, from there we need to execute several key ingredients. We must consistently deliver product storytelling that excites our customers, supported by compelling merchandise."", ""We need to drive demand with innovative marketing to regain a powerful voice in the cultural conversation, and we must create better more engaging omnichannel experiences with a clear and compelling pricing strategy. And most importantly, we must execute with excellence along every touch point and interaction. These elements form the basis of our brand reinvigoration playbook, while specific execution will differ by brand, we are working with each of our brand teams to implement this playbook holistically and consistently. Now I'd like to provide an update on the progress of each brand. Let's start with Old Navy. We are encouraged by the sales performance we saw in the back half of 2023 and the growth we delivered in the quarter. We are re-asserting Old Navy's authority as the number two apparel brand in the U.S. We delivered on-trend products, particularly in women's, active, bottoms, and knit, which performed well in the quarter, supported by our campaign with Natasha Lyonne, we showcased and leveraged our authority in the bottoms business and saw great response, especially to the tailor pant, the refreshed Pixie pant, and the cargo."", ""We're celebrating fashion, family, and fun through more precise marketing and storytelling. Another example of re-asserting our authority is Jingle Jammies. We took our famous Jingle Jammies and created Jingle Glamies, supporting it through a compelling social media campaign, where influencers paired Jammies with going outwear. This demonstrates how we take a product and make it a trend by dialing it up in a relevant way through storytelling. Old Navy is reinforcing value by communicating to customers with more clarity on price and quality, both in stores and online, highlighting the brand's value proposition. We're starting to see the strength of the brand identity evolving and coming alive through online and visual communications. The progress we are making at Old Navy gives us confidence in our ability to build consistency, while we deliver against our priorities."", ""Let's turn to Gap brand. We are driving continuous improvement and Gap has exciting potential as we focus on reigniting the brand dialog. Gap was built on strong product narratives with brilliant marketing, expressed through big ideas. Gap in its best days was a storyteller, who can take a product and create a trend using culturally relevant marketing. During the fourth quarter, our team to took Cashsoft Gap's innovative washable fabric that feels like cashmere and turned it into a big idea through creative storytelling, supported by elevated marketing and in-store design and digital presentation. We amplified this innovative product idea and it became a key contributor to the strength and sweaters we saw during the quarter. Its success is an important proof point that shows we can reignite Gap with big ideas and deliver improved results."", ""And now we're going to build on that example with relentless repetition. Our Lenin campaign, which launched in late February is the big idea for spring. The campaign is running now and I encourage you to take a look. This is a great example of the brand taking trend-right product and amplifying it, turning it into a big idea expressed through compelling in-store merchandising and strong digital execution with an innovative and culturally relevant marketing campaign entitled Linen Moves, featuring Musical Artist Tyla and Jungle. We struck a cultural record on Instagram and TikTok. Linen Moves was Gap brand's highest-performing video on both platforms ever and we're just getting started. Regarding Banana Republic, we are focused on re-establishing this brand to thrive in the premium lifestyle space."", ""As I dug in with the Banana Republic team, I realized that we are behind on the fundamentals, having the right product in the right place with the right price. 2024 will be about getting back to the basics, both for product and execution. This includes a focus on go-to-wardrobe pieces and BR Classics like sweaters, Oxford's suit separates, and khaki, those products that Banana Republic has been known for and will be again. We're encouraged by the brand aesthetic but it will take some time to get this right and unlock the potential of this business. Turning to Athleta, as we shared with you last quarter, the brand had missteps in prior years, and as a result, net sales for the brand remained muted in Q4 as we lapped markdowns, a challenge that we will continue to face through the first-half of 2024."", ""Athleta is a brand with significant growth potential and a clear and distinct positioning rooted in the Power of She. Early holiday ideas like cold weather train and our Shine Set sold well. These great ideas were ultimately bought too small, but they are good proof points that we are on the right track at Athleta. We're making progress in resetting this brand, returning to the core of Athleta's positioning. We started the new year with a cleaner pallet and we've seen early successes in new arrivals, although the changes are small, we are learning and encouraged by the customers' early reactions. We're focused on resetting the brand for success and putting Athleta back at the center of the cultural wellness conversation while reengaging the brand's performance roots."", ""Moving to the third strategic priority, strengthening our platform. We're focused on building and sharpening our operational capabilities to improve effectiveness and efficiency, and in turn drive cost leverage and demand generation. I recently returned from a two-week trip to Asia, during which I immersed myself in our supply chain infrastructure. I spent time listening, learning, and understanding the facets of our supply chain network, and I've gained insight into the incredible longstanding partnerships that we have built over the years. I also spend time in our Hyderabad office in India, studying our technology tools and capabilities. While encouraging, this is an area that we will be focused on elevating as part of our path to becoming a high-performing apparel company."", 'We are still in the assessment days, but my intent is to cultivate a digital-first organization and mindset that uses technology to enable business strategy, enhance the customer experience, and capture future opportunities. We are also beginning to evaluate how we can better leverage our media and marketing with the goal of developing more compelling creative and more innovative media to support growth across the portfolio. I believe our platform gives us meaningful differentiation and has the potential to unlock additional value creation, and we will work to further build out our capabilities to drive efficiency and effectiveness. The fourth priority is culture. Energizing our culture will fuel creativity and connectivity while driving accountability across our organization.', ""As I mentioned earlier, the recent appointment of Amy Thompson has bolstered our leadership team and underscored our investment in building a culture where employees show up every day with purpose and a sense of belonging. Amy is a builder of highly effective cultures that integrate purpose, vision, mission, and values throughout an end-to-end employee experience, all dedicated to driving business success. This includes igniting a growth mindset with empowered leaders and aligned incentives. I'm confident, she will help us build a winning culture at Gap, Inc. Today, our company is on strong financial footing. In 2024, we will continue to strengthen our fundamentals as we focus on our four strategic priorities. While there is a lot of work to do, I'm energized by the progress we have made so fa, and I'm inspired by the team's commitment and talent."", 'I want to take a moment to recognize our global team for their ongoing dedication, and I look forward to continuing this work in partnership with them as we drive towards becoming a high-performing apparel company. And now I will turn the call to Katrina for a closer look at our financials and our outlook for 2024.', ""Katrina O'Connell: Thank you, Richard, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We're pleased to report fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results ahead of our expectations with market share gains. We remain focused on the discipline we've created around margin recovery, expense actions, inventory management, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Richard noted, our financial and operational rigor continues to be foundational as we turn our attention to the reinvigoration of our brands in 2024. Before we begin, I'll note that all results reported today are inclusive of the 53rd week, except for comparable sales metrics. Some of the key highlights from fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 include the following. Fourth quarter comparable sales were flat and net sales were up 1%, ahead of our expectations driven by Old Navy and Gap brand sales results during the important holiday season."", ""And while full-year 2023 comparable sales were down 2% and net sales declined 5% year-over-year, this performance was in-line with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, as our financial and operational rigor begins to deliver more consistent performance. Old Navy drove a positive 2% comparable sales in the quarter, building increased confidence in consistent delivery of net sales growth. For the year, Old Navy comparable sales were down 1%, with positive comp performance in the second-half of the year and market share gains in all four quarters. Gap brand drove 4% quarterly comparable sales growth with a positive 1% comp for the year, outpacing the market. We delivered 530 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q4 and 380 basis points of expansion for the year versus last year's adjusted gross margin, resulting from trend-right product, which when combined with well-managed inventories led to improved promotional activity."", ""Margins also benefited from lower commodity costs. We reduced fiscal 2023 SG&A by over $300 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis, as a result of our commitment to financial discipline, all of which resulted in an operating margin of 5% for Q4 and an adjusted operating margin of 4.1% for the year, a 410 basis point improvement versus last year's adjusted operating margin, demonstrating meaningful progress on our path towards profitable sales growth. Inventories ended down 16% year-over-year and remained well-controlled, driving better profitability and working capital, and we ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, delivering $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. While we enter fiscal 2024 encouraged by the financial progress we've made, we're taking a balanced view of 2024 while we shore up the foundation of our brands."", ""I will discuss our outlook in more detail in a moment. Let me start with fourth quarter results. Net sales for the quarter were up 1% to last year at $4.3 billion, exceeding our previously communicated guidance range and comparable sales were flat. The 53rd week added approximately 4 percentage points of sales growth in the quarter. Also, the sale of Gap China last year had an estimated 2 point negative impact to Gap Inc.'s total net sales growth. Now let me provide fourth quarter sales results by brand. Starting with Old Navy, net sales were $2.3 billion, up 6% versus last year, with comparable sales up 2%. This represented the second consecutive quarter of positive comps at the brand. Turning to Gap brand. Gap brand net sales of $1 billion were down 5% versus last year."", ""Excluding the estimated negative impact to sales of 8 percentage points related to the sale of Gap China, net sales would have been up 3% versus last year. Comparable sales inflected positively, increasing 4% driven by continued strength in Women's, which gained market share for the fifth quarter in a row. Banana Republic net sales of $567 million declined 2% year-over-year, with comparable sales down 4%. Reestablishing Banana Republic will take time and we know there is work to be done to better execute many of the fundamentals in 2024. Athleta net sales of $419 million declined 4% versus last year. Comparable sales were down 10%, while the sales trend improved versus the prior quarter, net sales performance was still challenged due to tougher comparisons as we anniversary a period of elevated discounting, a dynamic which we expect will continue through the first-half of fiscal 2024."", ""While Athleta sales remain negative from the headwinds related to lapping last year's significant promotions, we're encouraged by the positive customer reaction to our new assortments, cleaner store presentations, improved online experiences, better marketing execution, and innovative new customer activations, which gives us confidence that the brand's efforts are driving underlying benefits. Now turning to gross margin in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.9% expanded 130 basis points versus last year. Merchandise margin increased 500 basis points in the quarter compared to last year, driven by an estimated 300 basis points of leverage from lower commodity and air freight costs. With the remaining leverage primarily driven by improved promotional activity ahead of expectations, as strong holiday assortments and well-controlled inventory enabled lower discounting during the season."", 'Rent, occupancy, and depreciation modestly declined on a nominal dollar basis versus last year. As a percentage of sales, ROD leveraged 30 basis points. Now let me turn to SG&A. SG&A was $1.46 billion in the quarter, largely in-line with our prior outlook. As a percentage of sales, SG&A of 33.9% leveraged 40 basis points versus last year. Operating income was $214 million, up $244 million versus last year. Fourth quarter operating margin of 5% improved 570 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Fourth quarter net interest income was $4 million, as higher interest earned on cash balances offset interest expense. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 15.1% and benefited from the release of certain reserves. Earnings per share in the quarter were $0.49.', ""Now turning to full-year fiscal 2023 results. Net sales were down 5% to last year at $14.9 billion and comparable sales were down 2%. The addition of the 53rd week contributed approximately one point of sales growth to the full year. And the sale of Gap China in fiscal 2022 had an estimated 2 point negative impact to Gap Inc.'s total net sales growth. Gross margin was 38.8%, expanding 450 basis points versus last year's reported gross margin and 380 basis points versus last year's adjusted gross margin. Merchandise margin increased 420 basis points versus last year on an adjusted basis, driven by 200 basis points of benefit from lower air freight expense, with the remaining expansion primarily driven by improved promotional activity. Inflationary impacts from commodity costs were relatively neutral for the year."", 'And ROD as a percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points versus last year. Reported SG&A was $5.22 billion for the year, or 35% of sales. Excluding restructuring costs and a gain related to the sale of an office building, adjusted SG&A was $5.17 billion, down 6% versus last year, primarily driven by cost savings as a result of strategic actions. Reported operating margin was 3.8%. Excluding $93 million in restructuring costs and $47 million related to the gain on sale of an office building, adjusted operating margin of 4.1% expanded 410 basis points versus last year. Fiscal year 2023 net interest expense was $4 million as interest expense was largely offset by interest earned on cash balances. The reported effective tax rate was 9.7% for the year and the adjusted effective tax rate was 11%.', 'During the year, we received discrete tax benefits from the impact of foreign operations, a transfer pricing settlement related to sourcing activities, and the release of certain reserves. Share count ended at 372 million. Reported earnings per share was $1.34. Excluding the impact of restructuring and the gain on sale of the office building, adjusted earnings per share was $1.43. Adjusted earnings per share includes $0.29 of discrete tax benefits and a $0.05 benefit related to the 53rd week. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory levels were meaningfully below last year in all quarters, with fiscal 2023 ending inventory declining 16% year-over-year. We ended the year with cash and equivalents of $1.9 billion, an increase of 54% from last year.', ""Full-year net cash from operating activities was $1.5 billion as a result of our improved operating profit and lower inventory buys. Free cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion. We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns. During the year, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, representing annual dividends of $0.60 per share. On February 27, our Board approved maintaining a dividend of $0.15 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In summary, as I reflect on 2023, I'm proud of the discipline and rigor we've brought back into our foundation, which has resulted in meaningful recovery and profits, as well as strong free cash flow. I'm also encouraged by the progress we made in the second-half of the year with sales stabilizing in the fourth quarter led by progress at Old Navy and Gap, early proof points of brand reinvigoration."", 'We remain committed in 2024 to delivering continued improved performance through maintaining our financial and operational rigor. Now let me turn to our 2024 Outlook. Our attention in 2024 remains on controlling the controllables -- gross margin recovery, expense discipline, inventory management, and maintaining a strong balance sheet, while we continue the foundational work-related to our brands as we aspire to drive relevance and revenue. We expect this rigor to deliver roughly flat sales excluding the 53rd week while delivering low-to-mid-teens operating income growth. Let me provide some details on our outlook, starting with the full year 2024. Our outlook of flat net sales year-over-year, excluding the 53rd week assumes continued performance at Old Navy and Gap, offset by challenging comparison for Athleta in the first-half of the year as the brand laps elevated discounting from 2023 and a longer recovery timeline at Banana Republic.', ""This net sales outlook also contemplates the following unique dynamics. First, as a reminder, 2024 is a 52-week year, but will be compared in total to a 53-week year in 2023. The loss of the 53rd week result in a detrimental impact of approximately $160 million to fiscal 2024 net sales. It's worth noting that the timing shifts associated with the 53rd week are expected to be impactful to both Q1 and Q4 in 2024. In the first quarter, we expect to benefit from the timing shifts as we lose a lower-volume week in February and add a modestly larger week in May. Additionally, the fourth quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by the loss of the 53rd week. Second, we have embedded multiple scenarios that contemplate modest headwinds in the first-half of the year related to late deliveries, as a result of geopolitical issues in the Red Sea."", ""We currently expect that impact will moderate in the second-half of 2024, but we will monitor the situation closely as we move through the year. And third, we're not anticipating major changes to consumer dynamics and macroeconomic pressures in 2024. In addition, I'd like to comment on the potential impact of the recent CFPB ruling on late fees for credit card holders. Our outlook assumes a mid-year implementation of the ruling, which we expect to be largely offset in 2024 by other levers within our credit card program. Now moving to gross margin. We anticipate gross margin expansion of at least 50 basis points for the full year compared to fiscal 2023's gross margin of 38.8%. Our gross margin outlook is driven by the following factors. We expect commodity cost tailwinds in the first-half of the year, which we anticipate will become largely neutral in the second-half of the year."", ""We expect ROD to deleverage modestly on the lower sales volume resulting from the loss of the 53rd week, and we continue to take a measured view of the consumer environment in fiscal 2024, particularly as we lap significant improvements we delivered in promotional activity during 2023. Regarding SG&A. SG&A of $5.1 billion is expected to decline year-over-year as we benefit from $150 million in reductions related to last year's strategic actions and lower costs from the loss of the 53rd week, which are partially offset by wage inflation. We are committed to strong financial discipline and we will continue to identify and pursue efficiencies as we drive our strategic plan. Considering the above dynamics regarding sales, gross margin, and SG&A, we see a clear path towards delivering low-to-mid-teens operating income growth in fiscal 2024 versus the $606 million of adjusted operating income in 2023."", ""We expect full year net interest expense to be similar to fiscal 2023 with interest expense being largely offset by interest on cash balances, however, we will be watching Fed actions to determine if lower interest rates over time might impact this dynamic in the year. We are planning for a more normalized tax rate of 28% in 2024. This compares to 9.7% in fiscal 2023 as we benefited from several discrete tax items, which as previously noted, added approximately $0.29 to fiscal 2023 earnings per share. We are planning capital expenditures of about $500 million for the year. Now let me share some color on your outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
