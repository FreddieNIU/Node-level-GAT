The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $146.651 billion.LVS Advisory made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""We purchased shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) around the same time as Interactive Brokers. The investment thesis is similar. Schwab benefits from higher interest rates as it collects income earned from client cash. While IBKR mostly serves retail investors, Schwab has a greater emphasis on wealth advisors and corporate retirement plans. B2B channels are sticker than retail traders and give Schwab pricing power to collect a greater portion of the interest earned than IBKR. Schwab is a more mature business and has fewer reinvestment opportunities than IBKR (which is why I prefer IBKR on the margin); however, Schwab has authorized a massive $15 billion share buyback program (!) representing over 10% of the company’s market cap at the time of announcement. Given that Schwab trades for a mid-teens price-to-earnings multiple and has a low cost of capital, the share buyback should be highly accretive. The combined tailwind from higher interest rates and the buyback program will lead to attractive earnings per share growth over the coming years.""Story continuesBest bank stocks for 2021Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy Now.MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) are some of the fastest growing stocks on the market that are currently trading at more than reasonable valuations.It’s no secret that growth stocks have struggled heavily over the last year, as rising inflation has sent investors scrambling into the confines of safer and more established companies. According to Morningstar data, large-cap growth stocks have fared the worst over the last year, losing 33.7% of their value, which has pushed several of them into undervalued territory.Some of the fastest growing stocks tend to be small and mid-cap companies, though they haven’t fared much better over the last year, losing 29.5% and 26.9% of their value respectively. In contrast, mid and large-cap value stocks have lost just 2.38% and 2.36% of their value respectively over the same period.The flight from growth stocks makes for a great opportunity for investors to be greedy while others are fearful, as Warren Buffett famously implored investors to do. And over the longer-term, the pendulum still remains on the side of growth stocks despite their recent losses. Growth stocks have gained an average of 223% over the last decade, compared to 143% gains for value stocks.Several of the best growth stocks on this list have bucked the overall trend and posted gains in 2022 thanks to their exceptional growth. Yet just as many others have experienced similar growth rates yet lost value on the stock market this year because of broader economic concerns, like continued rate increases.While interest rates aren’t likely to cool anytime soon, their predicted rise through 2023 has already been baked into most growth stocks, if not burnt into them. That gives investors a clear pathway to big gains when rates do inevitably stall or even recede. And unlike many traditional growth stocks, the majority of high growth stocks to buy now that are featured on this list are already profitable and growing those profits at a rapid rate.Story continuesIf you’re ready to get greedy, read on to check out the 10 best fast growth stocks to buy now.10 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy Now Our MethodologyThe following fast growth stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy Now10. Palomar Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLMR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), and Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) are some of the best fast growing stocks to buy now. Another is small-cap insurance company Palomar Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLMR), which has carved out a profitable niche for itself by selling insurance coverage in underserved areas of the market.Palomar Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLMR) has been growing its revenue at close to a 50% clip over each of the last three years, with its trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue totaling $312 million compared to just $73 million in sales in 2018. After taking a hit in 2020, its net income and EPS also skyrocketed in 2021, hitting $45.8 million and $1.76 per diluted share respectively. Its net income has continued to climb higher this year and analysts expect the company to pull in $3.72 in EPS next year, double what it managed in 2021, while its revenue is expected to top $1 billion for the first time.Hedge fund ownership of Palomar Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLMR) peaked in the middle of 2020 and bottomed out a year later. It’s since rebounded slightly, doubling between Q3 2021 and Q1 2022. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management owned the largest stake in PLMR on June 30, while Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital added a 252,155-share position to its 13F portfolio during the quarter.9. Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 13 Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ), which manufactures solar panels in China, is on a tremendous growth trajectory. Revenue grew by more than 50% last year to $5.28 billion and its trailing twelve-month revenue is up by another $1 billion to $6.32 billion and the company is guiding for a 47% year-over-year sales increase this year.Gross profit also made a big jump last year and has continued to rise over the past 12 months, though expenses have also been rising rapidly to offset those gains. Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ) trades at just 17.4x earnings, which is quite cheap for a company growing at this type of rate. There are some concerns investors should be aware of however, namely the company’s more than $3 billion in debt, much of which is short-term.Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:CSIQ) shares more than quadrupled in value from their pandemic floor in March 2020 through January 2021. Hedge funds poured into the stock in Q3 2020 but many took some profits from their holding and quickly unloaded it a quarter later. Overall hedge fund ownership of CSIQ has been cut in half since Q3 2020.8. Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 16 Fiber optic management and products company Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD) has been around for decades and was unprofitable for much of that time. But the company has recently found its footing in the fiber optic delivery space and is starting to grow at an impressive rate. In its latest full fiscal year ended September 2021, the company grew revenue by more than 50% to $141 million and its TTM revenue has already jumped by another 50% to $221 million.Even more impressively, Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD)’s net margins are greatly expanding alongside its sales, growing by 178% year-over-year during its previous fiscal year, which contributing to EPS nearly tripling year-over-year to $1.47 per diluted share. Net income has nearly doubled during the TTM period, while operating income has more than doubled and is nearly 10x greater than what it was during the company’s fiscal year ended September 2019. CLFD trades at 30.8x earnings, which looks more than reasonable given its growth trajectory and the efficiency it’s displaying in becoming more profitable.Clearfield, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLFD) shares have been on an absolute tear in recent quarters and hedge funds have increasingly come along for the ride, with the number of funds long CLFD jumping from just three at the end of Q3 2020 to 17 at the end of Q2 2022. Brad Farber’s Atika Capital owned the largest Clearfield stake at the end of Q2, holding 417,000 shares worth $25.8 million.7. Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 After several years of steady but unspectacular growth, renewable energy company Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC) has taken off this year, growing its TTM revenue to $1.91 billion compared to $1.22 billion in 2021. The company’s TTM operating income has also jumped by 50% compared to 2021, hitting $145 million.Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC)’s Q3 revenue grew by 61% year-over-year to $441 million, while GAAP EPS grew by 55% to $0.51. The company was awarded several major projects during the quarter, including a $98 million utility savings project in Fort Irwin, California, and stands to be a big beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act, which should provide it with substantial long-term growth opportunities. Among itsHedge fund ownership of Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC) has seen a similar climb as Clearfield in recent quarters, jumping from five funds long AMRC in the middle of 2019 to 18 long the stock three years later. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management added Ameresco to its 13F portfolio during Q2, as did Till Bechtolsheimer’s Arosa Capital Management.6. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 48 Closing out the first half of the list is data center equipment company Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET), whose shares are down by nearly 10% this year despite the company’s spectacular results. Arista grew revenue by 57% year-over-year in Q3 to $1.18 billion, while net income jumped by 58% to $354 million and EPS soared by 61% to $1.13.The company is predicting 45% revenue growth in Q4 at the midpoint of its guidance range and believes it has a significant total addressable market that should lead to sustained growth in the coming years. Companies are increasingly upgrading to 400-gig technology, which nonetheless isn’t projected to overtake 100-gig deployments until 2025, so there’s a long runway ahead for Arista Networks.Hedge fund ownership of Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) has jumped higher for three straight quarters, rising by more than 50% during that time and hitting new all-time highs during each of those quarters as the smart money shows increasing bullishness in Arista’s secular tailwinds. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management (1.89 million shares) and Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley’s Polar Capital (1.33 million shares) owned the largest ANET stakes on June 30.The Artisan Mid Cap Fund is bullish on Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)’s profit cycle, as discussed in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Arista Networks is the market leader for cloud networking equipment used in data centers for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. The company’s top line growth has recently been bolstered by 400G deployments—the next generation of tech powering data centers—and further enterprise network penetration as customers migrate away from Cisco (~80% market share vs. ~5% for Arista). While the profit cycle is nicely in motion, we pared our exposure as shares began to approach our PMV estimate.”Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), and MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) are some of the best fast growth stocks to buy now.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are three of the biggest companies in the world that have all hit 52-week lows this month.With a recession looming and a bear market having taken hold this year, it’s not surprising that many stocks are hovering around 52-week lows. It is rare to see so many high quality stocks get beaten down to the degree they have in recent months however. The four most popular stocks among hedge funds have all touched 52-week lows since November 3, creating a great opportunity for investors to buy low on some of the most respected companies in the world.Scanning the market for stocks at 52-week lows is a time-honored tradition among value investors, who covet the opportunity to buy quality companies with long track records of success at discounted prices. In many cases, such companies are merely caught in cyclical lows, without any real change to their long-term fundamental outlook that justifies their shares trading at their lowest point in a year or more.There are several technical reasons why stocks at 52-week lows can make good short-term buys as well. As stocks reach new yearly lows, short sellers are more likely to have profited from their positions and will look to buy shares to cover them. Bargain hunters, like the aforementioned value investors, are also more likely to start buying shares when they cross the 52-week low threshold, which can provide them with an immediate, though potentially short-lived, boost.That doesn’t mean every stock at a 52-week low is necessarily poised for a rebound however, either in the short or long term, which is evidenced by multiple stocks on this list, which have fallen to 2+ year lows. If you had bought these stocks earlier this year expecting a rebound by this point, you’d be sorely disappointed, as they’ve continued to trend down amid the tough economic backdrop.Story continuesAs with any investment decision, investors need to ask themselves why these stocks are at 52-week lows and whether their long-term outlook has changed enough in the last year to justify those new lows. If that doesn’t appear to be the case, it could be that the stock was simply overvalued a year ago and has fallen back to a more realistic valuation, which has happened to quite a number of growth stocks this year.We’ll try to answer some of those burning questions in this article as we take a look at 10 of the best 52-Week Low Stocks to buy now.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following 52-week low stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now10. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 1-Year Share Price Decline: 36% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are several stocks worth buying now that have all hit 52-week lows within the last week. Another is medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), whose shares touched a 52-week low on November 4, a week after the release of the company’s Q3 results.Edwards Lifesciences shares fell by 17.9% on October 28 after the company announced Q3 sales of $1.32 billion and pro forma EPS of $0.61, both of which represented slight misses compared to consensus estimates. Sales grew just 1% year-over-year during the quarter, but 7% on a constant currency basis. The company’s Q4 pro forma EPS guidance of between $2.40 and $2.50 also fell below estimates, as well as the company’s earlier guidance. Despite the sell off and EW shares hitting a 52-week low, they still trade at 31.2x earnings, which is rich given the tepid Q3 growth, but the company looks to have a compelling long-term growth runway ahead of it.Hedge fund ownership of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) dipped by 13% during Q2 after ticking up for two straight quarters. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in EW as of June 30 among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 7.33 million shares worth $697 million.Wedgewood Partners believes that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)’s growth should accelerate in the years to come, as discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) reported just +5% growth in revenue (foreign exchange adjusted) compared to a year ago. While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global healthcare systems emerging from pandemic disruptions. The Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system, PASCAL, and also presented compelling related clinical data, which should help support accelerating growth over the next few years. As for Edwards’ core TAVR system, there continues to be a (unfortunately) pent-up, untreated population suffering from severe aortic stenosis that will finally be able to find their way back into healthcare systems as labor market pressures ease.”9. Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 1-Year Share Price Decline: 18% Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares hit a 52-week low on November 3 following the release of its Q3 results and underwhelming billings guidance for Q4. The cybersecurity company’s Q3 results were pretty good, as sales rose by 33% year-over-year to $1.15 billion, slightly topping estimates, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 65% from a year earlier to $0.33 and easily beat consensus.Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)’s Q4 billings guidance left something to be desired with investors however, coming up short of the $1.74 billion consensus estimate, even at the top end of the company’s range. Management cited the uncertain macro-economic environment when drawing up its guidance, which may have caused additional near-term investor concerns. Longer-term, Fortinet looks like a strong bet to continue growing at a steady pace in the burgeoning cybersecurity space, which makes its recent weakness a good buying opportunity.Hedge funds sold off Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) in droves shortly into the pandemic, with the stock hitting a 7-year low in smart money ownership at the end of Q1 2021. There’s been an 83% surge in the number of funds long FTNT since then, including a 13% rise in Q2 2022. The company’s biggest bulls were all loading up on shares in Q2, as seven of the eight funds with the largest Fortinet holdings as of June 30 increased the size of their stakes by at least 360% during the quarter.8. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 1-Year Share Price Decline: 34.2% The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shares hit a 52-week (and 2-year) low on November 2, but have since rebounded by 20% in the last week. The cosmetic company’s sales fell by 11% year-over-year during its Q1 of fiscal year 2023, sliding to $3.93 billion, while organic net sales dipped by 5%.

On a constant currency basis, Global Payments expects to grow revenue by 10% to 11% this year.The 3-year low for GPN shares was spite of the company finding a buyer for its Netspend consumer business earlier this year, which netted the company $1 billion in cash and will allow it to focus on its primary B2B operations.Hedge fund ownership of Global Payments Inc.

The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”Amazon.com, Inc.

Brilliant young minds are helping shape a more sustainable world by developing innovative ways to manage water and by educating others in their communities about water challenges.At World Water Week 2022 in Stockholm, Canada's Annabelle Rayson received the Stockholm Junior Water Prize (SJWP) for her research on treating and preventing harmful algae blooms using micro aquatic organisms called zooplankton. The project looked at the biomanipulation of different genotypes of a particular species of freshwater zooplankton to determine the best type to eat the algae and control blooms. Her findings can help influence freshwater protection and conservation efforts.Rayson is among tens of thousands of students from more than 40 countries to engage with the SJWP, as young leaders come to the fore and solve water in collaboration with industry experts on climate and sustainability solutions.""Young people need to be involved with water because this is our future, our planet. What inspires me is the fact that people are becoming more and more aware of water issues. People have taken water for granted, but with climate change, people realize that we need to do something,"" said Rayson. ""Participating in the SJWP, I met 58 phenomenal students around my age from every corner of the globe. Seeing their passion, research, and drive to make the world a better place gives me hope.""Among the building movement of young innovators is Team WatApp, which recently won the HackZurich Xylem Water Challenge. In September, the team won the non-stop 40-hour hackathon event in Zurich, Switzerland, with a social gaming app that helps people make smart water choices in their everyday lives, build long-term water-saving habits, and share their results with friends.Story continuesOther promising projects showcasing youth leadership include UpLift, a participant in last year's Xylem Ignite Innovation Challenge. The project uses a machine learning model that can train existing data to predict flooding severity. Through a dedicated app, users can input discharge, gauge height and rainfall values to generate accurate rainfall and flooding predictions. The application also explains common flood terminology for greater awareness and education, and has a portal where users can provide feedback to promote community engagement.Global water technology leader Xylem (NYSE:XYL) has a history of promoting youth engagement through its long-running sponsorship of the SJWP, its partnership with HackZurich, and the Xylem Ignite Innovation Challenge. Last year, the Xylem Ignite Innovation Challenge invited more than 800 students from around the world to design and develop solutions to real-world water challenges.""Engaging and empowering the next generation is critical to ensuring a sustainable water future,"" said Austin Alexander, Vice President, Sustainability and Social Impact at Xylem. ""That's why we're leaning into the passion and creativity of young people through Xylem Ignite, our global youth innovation program that launched in 2020. This initiative connects us to some of the brightest and best young minds - and unleashes their potential to change the world.""Xylem also recently announced the renewal of its partnership with Manchester City Football Club, an alliance that aims to inspire young people to act on global water issues. Since 2021, the Club and Xylem have reached more than 6,000 students globally through the Water Heroes Academy - an initiative that supports water education activities led by young leaders in São Paulo, Mumbai, Cape Town, New York City and Shanghai.This year, the Club and Xylem announced an expansion of the initiative to include youth-led projects in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Cape Coast, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne. This November, Manchester City fans will have a chance to learn more about the five new projects and vote for their favorite young water heroes.

The public and private sectors have pledged about half of the funds each.Indonesia has also set a goal to reach net-zero emissions in its power sector by 2050, a decade before its current target in its national climate plan, and to double the pace of renewable energy deployment so that it accounts for at least 34% of all power generation by 2030.""We've built a platform for cooperation that can truly transform Indonesia's power sector from coal to renewables and support significant economic growth,"" U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry said.EARLIER PEAKThe Treasury official said peak power emissions for Indonesia in 2030 under the plan would be at a level 25% lower than their currently estimated peak in 2037. Indonesia's annual emissions reduction over those years would be larger than Britain's annual power sector emissions, the official said.Story continuesThe plan will eliminate 300 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions through 2030 and a reduction of well over 2 billion tonnes through 2060, the partners said in their statement.""Indonesia is committed to using our energy transition to achieve a green economy and drive sustainable development,"" President Joko Widodo said in a statement. ""This partnership will generate valuable lessons for the global community.""U.S., JAPAN LEADThe United States and Japan are co-leading the effort with Indonesia on behalf of the other G7 democracies Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, as well as partners Norway, Denmark and the European Union.Multilateral development banks and the Climate Investment Funds will account for about a third of the $10 billion in public funding for Indonesia's JETP, CIF head Mafalda Duarte told reporters. CIF has allocated about $500 million to aid Indonesia's energy transition.""There is a recognition that this is the first move, a first package of support, and that more will be needed,"" Duarte said when asked about the adequacy of the JETP funding.On Monday, Japan announced it would help Indonesia transition away from coal power through public and private institutions, including the state-affiliated Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).Indonesia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and a private power producer on Monday announced plans to refinance and prematurely retire a 660-megawatt coal-fired power plant in West Java province, the first such deal under the ADB's new carbon emissions reduction financing programme.U.S. Treasury and State Department officials said half of the $20 billion would come from the private sector, with seven global banks participating: Bank of America Citigroup Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Macquarie and MUFG.The U.S. officials said public finance would include concessional lending and equity, as well as some grants.The United States will work with Indonesia to map out a 90-day plan to set up a secretariat to run the initiative and for Indonesia to reform its policies, such as streamlining permitting and setting up a competitive procurement process to make the targets achievable.South Africa this month said the scale of funding it requires to phase out its coal was much higher than the funding mobilized through its JETP mechanism.The State Department official said it had learned some lessons and had engaged local partners from the outset to ""move as fast as possible"".

First up, we have Berkshire Hathaway releasing its 13F filing, trimming its stake in three companies that we want to bring your attention to-- GM, US Bancorp, and also Bank of New York Mellon. So GM, you could see still barely holding onto gains, but US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon moving to the downside here in extended trading.On the flip side, Berkshire Hathaway initiating its stake in two stocks that we want to highlight. We have Jefferies Financial-- that's up just around 5% in after-hours trading. Taiwan Semiconductors moving about 6% on the news of Berkshire Hathaway adding stakes here to-- in Jefferies and also Taiwan Semiconductors.I also want to bring up Apple because Apple, we know Berkshire Hathaway has had a large stake in Apple now for quite some time. Warren Buffett has remained bullish on Apple. Apple today closing up just around 2/10 of a percent, 148.57. Now Berkshire Hathaway, Apple represents 42% of their disclosed assets. So it certainly accounts for a large chunk of that portfolio.Let's switch gears here and take a look at thredUP. That stock on the move after-hours, following its latest earnings release. The online resale platform cutting its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, also trimming its guidance for the year.Now despite that outlook, the CEO remaining relatively upbeat, given the fact that we are in a slowing economy. The CEO saying that he still has confidence in the company's ability to make progress towards profitability. I think that was key there in this statement, and that's why we're not seeing more significant losses after-hours. The stock up just around 6/10 of a percent.But taking a look at a longer chart here, certainly the stock has been under a tremendous amount of pressure, to say the least, under a buck today, off 92% for the year. And I also want to pull up a FedEx. Taking a look at that intraday chart, closing the day off just around a half of a percent, 174.76.Story continuesSome updates from the company, they are putting a number of workers on furlough. They didn't detail exactly how many workers are going to be affected. This, of course, is the latest signal about a slowdown in shipments. And then of course, investors look at FedEx just in terms of what this tells us about the broader economy and where things stand. Now, in a statement, FedEx did say that it will continue to evaluate the current environment right now and bring back furloughed employees as business circumstances allow.Over the last-- let's take a look at the three-month chart. Of course, the stock has been under a little bit of pressure, off just around 24%. Year to date, we're looking at losses of about 33%.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, of course, when they last sounded the alarm bells, it was the global economy is teetering on the edge. And then the longer we got out from it, it looked like more of a FedEx problem than a global problem, as UPS turned in some decent numbers. So always interesting to follow. Seana, thank you.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Chevron Corporation (CVX), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Chevron shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+59.6% vs. +47.7%). Based on a slew of tailwinds, the company is poised for further capital appreciation. The supermajor is considered one of the best placed integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production growth, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.Chevron’s Noble Energy takeover expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin along with the addition of cash generating offshore assets in Israel. In shareholder friendly moves, the integrated major recently hiked its dividend and boosted the stock repurchase program.Considering all of these factors, the Zacks analyst expect the company’s EPS to grow 148% this year. Consequently, Chevron is viewed as a preferred energy major to own now.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+36.3% vs. +8.0%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals.Lilly expects to launch five new medicines by 2023 end including Mounjaro for type II diabetes (already launched) and donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs have multibillion dollar sales potential.However, generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q3 results. Lilly has a negative record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Charles Schwab have declined -4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry’s decline of -9.5%. The company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its elevated expenses might hamper the company's bottom-line growth to an extent. A stretched valuation limits the upside potential of the stock.Story continuesHowever, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters. Strategic acquisitions, likely to be earnings accretive, have reinforced Schwab's position as a leading brokerage player. Offering commission-free trading has led to a rise in client assets and brokerage accounts, thereby improving trading revenues. The interest rate hikes are expected to aid margin growth. Also, Schwab's efficient capital deployments reflect a solid balance sheet position, through which it will enhance shareholder value.(You can read the full research report on Charles Schwab here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Salesforce, Inc.

However, weak uptake of software licenses and support offerings is a concern.3M (MMM) Benefits From Pricing Actions Amid Forex WoesWhile pricing actions and cost-control measures are supporting 3M's margin performance, the Zacks analyst is concerned about foreign-exchange woes, which force the company to lower its 2022 forecast.Investments Aid AES Corp (AES) Amid the Rising InflationPer the Zacks Analyst, increased investments in renewables bolsters AES Corporation earnings growth prospects. Yet, the rising inflation resulting in increased expenses remains a bottleneck.Kirby's (KEX) Marine Transportation Arm Aids, Fuel Costs AilThe Zacks analyst is impressed with the performance of Kirby's Marine Transportation segment. However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth.Growing Cloud Deals &amp; Strength in Vantage Aid Teradata (TDC) Per the Zacks analyst, Teradata is witnessing solid growth in public annual recurring revenues due to rising cloud deals.

50,4b288fe4-fcdc-3b21-b6e1-fa5e69330a6c,MSFT,2022-11-15,10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-52-week-low-171422641.html,1668446062,STORY,"['AMZN', 'ZTS', 'EW', 'GPN', 'FTNT', 'EL', 'MSFT']","[In this article we present the list of 10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are three of the biggest companies in the world that have all hit 52-week lows this month.With a recession looming and a bear market having taken hold this year, it’s not surprising that many stocks are hovering around 52-week lows. It is rare to see so many high quality stocks get beaten down to the degree they have in recent months however. The four most popular stocks among hedge funds have all touched 52-week lows since November 3, creating a great opportunity for investors to buy low on some of the most respected companies in the world.Scanning the market for stocks at 52-week lows is a time-honored tradition among value investors, who covet the opportunity to buy quality companies with long track records of success at discounted prices. In many cases, such companies are merely caught in cyclical lows, without any real change to their long-term fundamental outlook that justifies their shares trading at their lowest point in a year or more.There are several technical reasons why stocks at 52-week lows can make good short-term buys as well. As stocks reach new yearly lows, short sellers are more likely to have profited from their positions and will look to buy shares to cover them. Bargain hunters, like the aforementioned value investors, are also more likely to start buying shares when they cross the 52-week low threshold, which can provide them with an immediate, though potentially short-lived, boost.That doesn’t mean every stock at a 52-week low is necessarily poised for a rebound however, either in the short or long term, which is evidenced by multiple stocks on this list, which have fallen to 2+ year lows. If you had bought these stocks earlier this year expecting a rebound by this point, you’d be sorely disappointed, as they’ve continued to trend down amid the tough economic backdrop.Story continuesAs with any investment decision, investors need to ask themselves why these stocks are at 52-week lows and whether their long-term outlook has changed enough in the last year to justify those new lows. If that doesn’t appear to be the case, it could be that the stock was simply overvalued a year ago and has fallen back to a more realistic valuation, which has happened to quite a number of growth stocks this year.We’ll try to answer some of those burning questions in this article as we take a look at 10 of the best 52-Week Low Stocks to buy now.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following 52-week low stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now10. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 1-Year Share Price Decline: 36% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are several stocks worth buying now that have all hit 52-week lows within the last week. Another is medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), whose shares touched a 52-week low on November 4, a week after the release of the company’s Q3 results.Edwards Lifesciences shares fell by 17.9% on October 28 after the company announced Q3 sales of $1.32 billion and pro forma EPS of $0.61, both of which represented slight misses compared to consensus estimates. Sales grew just 1% year-over-year during the quarter, but 7% on a constant currency basis. The company’s Q4 pro forma EPS guidance of between $2.40 and $2.50 also fell below estimates, as well as the company’s earlier guidance. Despite the sell off and EW shares hitting a 52-week low, they still trade at 31.2x earnings, which is rich given the tepid Q3 growth, but the company looks to have a compelling long-term growth runway ahead of it.Hedge fund ownership of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) dipped by 13% during Q2 after ticking up for two straight quarters. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in EW as of June 30 among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 7.33 million shares worth $697 million.Wedgewood Partners believes that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)’s growth should accelerate in the years to come, as discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) reported just +5% growth in revenue (foreign exchange adjusted) compared to a year ago. While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global healthcare systems emerging from pandemic disruptions. The Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system, PASCAL, and also presented compelling related clinical data, which should help support accelerating growth over the next few years. As for Edwards’ core TAVR system, there continues to be a (unfortunately) pent-up, untreated population suffering from severe aortic stenosis that will finally be able to find their way back into healthcare systems as labor market pressures ease.”9. Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 1-Year Share Price Decline: 18% Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares hit a 52-week low on November 3 following the release of its Q3 results and underwhelming billings guidance for Q4. The cybersecurity company’s Q3 results were pretty good, as sales rose by 33% year-over-year to $1.15 billion, slightly topping estimates, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 65% from a year earlier to $0.33 and easily beat consensus.Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)’s Q4 billings guidance left something to be desired with investors however, coming up short of the $1.74 billion consensus estimate, even at the top end of the company’s range. Management cited the uncertain macro-economic environment when drawing up its guidance, which may have caused additional near-term investor concerns. Longer-term, Fortinet looks like a strong bet to continue growing at a steady pace in the burgeoning cybersecurity space, which makes its recent weakness a good buying opportunity.Hedge funds sold off Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) in droves shortly into the pandemic, with the stock hitting a 7-year low in smart money ownership at the end of Q1 2021. There’s been an 83% surge in the number of funds long FTNT since then, including a 13% rise in Q2 2022. The company’s biggest bulls were all loading up on shares in Q2, as seven of the eight funds with the largest Fortinet holdings as of June 30 increased the size of their stakes by at least 360% during the quarter.8. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 1-Year Share Price Decline: 34.2% The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shares hit a 52-week (and 2-year) low on November 2, but have since rebounded by 20% in the last week. The cosmetic company’s sales fell by 11% year-over-year during its Q1 of fiscal year 2023, sliding to $3.93 billion, while organic net sales dipped by 5%. Adjusted earnings tumbled by 28% year-over-year to $1.37 per diluted share.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) anticipates a rough fiscal Q2 due to various headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar and tighter inventory management among retailers. The company projects diluted earnings will fall by as much as 54% year-over-year during the quarter. Management expects those headwinds to begin abating in the second half of its fiscal 2023 however, with a return to strong organic sales and adjusted EPS growth.Hedge fund ownership of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shot up during the first quarter of 2021, but has fallen by 24% since then. It has ticked up slightly this year as shares have fallen however, as hedge funds appear to like EL’s upside potential at the current depressed prices. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP owns 5.95 million EL shares as of June 30, with 6.68% 13F exposure to the stock. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates cut its stake in the company by 16% during Q2 to own 612,560 shares at the end of the quarter.7. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 1-Year Share Price Decline: 20.7% Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) shares tumbled to a 3-year low on November 3 despite the company soundly beating revenue estimates with its third quarter results. The fintech company grew revenue by 3.8% year-over-year during Q3 to $2.29 billion, beating estimates by $250 million. Adjusted EPS rose $0.30 year-over-year to $2.48, which matched estimates. On a constant currency basis, Global Payments expects to grow revenue by 10% to 11% this year.The 3-year low for GPN shares was spite of the company finding a buyer for its Netspend consumer business earlier this year, which netted the company $1 billion in cash and will allow it to focus on its primary B2B operations.Hedge fund ownership of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) peaked at the end of Q3 2021, but has fallen for the past three straight quarters as shares have started to tumble. There’s been a 16% decline in the number of funds long GPN during that period. Larry Robbins’ healthcare-focused Glenview Capital Management is a firm bull on GPN, owning 2.35 million shares on June 30, with the stock ranking as the fund’s top non-healthcare pick.Manole Capital Management has been a long time bull of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) and had this to say about the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Over the next week or so, we will be publishing a stock-specific note on payment processor Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN). We have owned GPN for nearly two decades and it currently is one of our largest positions. We will begin by highlighting recent spending trends, eCommerce developments and how many of our payment companies can actually benefit from inflation and higher costs. We will discuss their business, industry trends, what is driving their growth, and then highlight their compelling valuation.”6. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 62 1-Year Share Price Decline: 31.5% Closing out the first half of the list is Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), whose shares hit a 2-year low on November 4. The animal healthcare giant slashed its 2022 sales guidance by between $150 million and $225 million on November 3, in addition to cutting its earnings projections, which triggered a flight from the stock. The company cited several headwinds as being contributors to the weaker projections, including unfavorable currency exchange rates, supply chain obstacles, and staffing challenges at veterinarian offices. The company otherwise remains bullish on its long-term outlook and growth catalysts thanks to its pipeline and global scale, predicting market-beating sales growth in the years to come.Hedge fund ownership of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) hit an all-time high at the end of Q1 even as shares started tumbling, though there was a slight pullback in Q2. Barry Dargan’s Intermede Investment Partners and Nicolai Tangen’s Ako Capital each owned more than 1 million ZTS shares on September 30 and had 4.39% and 3% 13F exposure to the stock respectively.The Baron Health Care Fund talked about some of the recent developments at Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Zoetis Inc., the global leader in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of companion and farm animal health medicine and vaccines, fell along with shares of other high-multiple 2021 standout performers. We retain conviction as Zoetis recently reported a top and bottom line beat with more than 21% growth driven by dermatology, parasiticides, and recently launched monoclonal osteoarthritic treatments. The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”Amazon.com, Inc.

These inauthentic accounts are typically automated or bot accounts that can be used to trick or harass players through spam, facilitate cheating activities, inflate friend or follow numbers or initiate distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks.Dave McCarthy, Xbox corporate vice president of player services, said the increase in proactive moderation is an effort to “weed out” the accounts before they hit the system. Proactive enforcements, which made up 65% of the total, refers to artificial intelligence or human moderators identifying, analyzing and taking action on behavior that goes against Xbox’s community standards. Microsoft also relies on players to report inappropriate content through reactive moderation.Inauthentic accounts aren’t just from bots advertising cheat codes for games, McCarthy said. “There’s regular activity by nation-state actors and other funded groups attempting to distribute content that has no place on our services,” he added.Xbox joins a growing number of gaming and gaming-service providers who plan to release transparency reports on a regular basis in an effort to crack down on toxicity and abuse and to create a safe experience for players. Twitch, the live-stream gaming site owned by Amazon.com Inc., released its first report in early 2021 and Discord released its first in 2019. Xbox’s Japanese console competitors PlayStation, owned by Sony Group Corp., and Nintendo Co., don’t release analogous moderation data. Microsoft said it would release a report every six months.Story continuesMcCarthy declined to comment on the size or employment status of Xbox’s human moderators. Discord and Twitch provide significantly more detail on their moderation efforts, including the number of subpoenas processed and data on extremist content. McCarthy said Xbox is “learning our way into what a good transparency report looks like for us.”Microsoft was able to increase proactive moderation on the site so much in part as a result of the company’s 2021 acquisition of content moderation provider Two Hat, known for its text-filtering software. McCarthy also cited Microsoft’s broader resources, documented in its, bi-annual digital trust report, that allow the company to “harvest more products out of Microsoft Research using video and image detection.”Unlike Tencent Holdings Ltd.-owned Riot Games, which makes popular games League of Legends and Valorant, Xbox doesn’t capture or analyze players’ voice audio when a report for harassment is submitted. McCarthy said Xbox may increase its resources in that area in the future, but noted there are privacy considerations.Xbox took action on 1 million accounts for profanity, 814,000 accounts for adult sexual content and 759,000 for harassment or bullying in the first six months of 2022, according to the report. Xbox players provided more than 33 million reports over the same time period, a 36% decline from the same period a year earlier.Microsoft is awaiting regulatory approval for its purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc., which could bring popular games like Call of Duty and Overwatch into its moderation coverage. McCarthy declined to comment on how or whether Xbox will participate in moderating those games citing the ongoing regulatory review.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX Was an Empty Black Box All AlongNorth America’s EV Future Hinges on a North Carolina Turtle PondTwitter’s Layoffs Are the Perfect Example of How Not to Fire PeopleFatal Crashes Highlight Rising Danger of Illicit Charter FlightsGoogle’s Moonshot Lab Is Now in the Strawberry-Counting Business©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

A supply-and-demand insights module will use artificial intelligence to predict shortages and supply constraints, while a tool for order management helps organize and automate filling orders. The software integrates with Microsoft’s Teams chat and conferencing software to ease communication with outside suppliers, and will include features and services from partners such as C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. and FedEx Corp.From food items to consumer goods, autos and game consoles, supply-chain snags have upended industries around the world since 2020, costing companies billions in lost revenue. That has accelerated the demand for a better way to track which parts and goods are likely to be in short supply, and when — and how to plan around the challenges. Many companies, especially in the automotive industry, were badly caught out by their lack of insight into the supply chain, particularly of fundamental components such as semiconductors.“The business need has honestly probably never been as acute as it is right now,” Charles Lamanna, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview. “Everything is kind of changing and that’s the state of global trade.”Supply chains that are considered “resilient” aren’t as flexible as they seem, he said. That’s because companies often think they have been careful to procure from more than one supplier, only to discover that further down the chain several vendors are also relying on the same piece of equipment or goods that are delayed, Lamanna said.Story continuesIFit Health &amp; Fitness Inc., which sells NordicTrack treadmills, rowing machines and other fitness equipment, was one customer testing Microsoft’s new software. The company’s warehouses are far from its customers, and its bulky machines weigh 300 to 400 pounds. They can’t be easily shipped using conventional carriers, yet customers expect fast delivery, said Robert Critchley, iFit’s vice president of transportation and warehousing. The company set up smaller fulfillment centers closer to customers, but iFit wasn’t very good at predicting what kind of inventory should be stored at these sites, he said. Microsoft’s new product let iFit correctly predict what was needed 70% of the time, up from 30% without it.Supply Chain Center software also helps customers track the sustainability and carbon impacts in their supply chains.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFTX Was an Empty Black Box All AlongNorth America’s EV Future Hinges on a North Carolina Turtle PondTwitter’s Layoffs Are the Perfect Example of How Not to Fire PeopleFatal Crashes Highlight Rising Danger of Illicit Charter FlightsGoogle’s Moonshot Lab Is Now in the Strawberry-Counting Business©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Since everything runs off a Dataverse environment, the data is consistent no matter what module is being using. This eliminates pasting information back and forth and reconciling which reports have the most up-to-date information.With today's announcements, Microsoft is taking a significant step toward its commitment to reimagine the supply chain, helping drive efficiency and agility for our customers.To learn more, visit the Official Microsoft Blog.

Respondents represent a mix of in-person, fully remote, and hybrid workers, as well as both active (requires physical movement for much of the day) and sedentary (requires minimal movement for most of the day) job roles.Over half of the participants (64%) agreed that they are satisfied with their organization's opportunities for career advancement. However, at the same time, 63% said they would be more likely to stay at their current employer if they had better access to these career development opportunities.Our research also found that there are key variations in satisfaction depending on employees' working arrangement (remote, hybrid, on-site) and industry sector.Here are some of the top findings:63% of participants said they would be more likely to stay at their organization if they were provided better career advancement opportunities.Data analytics, computer, software, and marketing skills are the top hard skills employees, overall, felt are holding them back from career advancement. The top soft skills employees felt are holding them back are time management, digital literacy, and leadership skills.On-site employees would prefer to have more opportunities for in-person training/lessons with subject matter experts, while remote employees would prefer to have more access to a suite of online courses.Story continuesKey Findings: The Career Progression Opportunities Employees Want#1 More than 50% of employees are happy with their current career advancement opportunities, but remote workers are not as satisfied as those who work in person.Overall, 23% ""strongly agreed"" and 41% ""agreed"" that they are satisfied with the training and education opportunities their organization provides for career advancement.However, those working fully remote (14%) are more likely to disagree with this than those working fully on-site (8%) or hybrid (7%).Also, full-time workers (69%) are more likely to agree/strongly agree that they are satisfied with their career advancement opportunities than part-time employees (57%).Finally, those in professional and business services (84%) are more likely to agree/strongly agree that they are satisfied with their professional development opportunities compared to those in any other industry (values range from 44-65%).#2 Career advancement opportunities play a big role in retention.63% of employees either ""strongly agreed"" or ""agreed"" that they would be more likely to stay at an organization if they were provided with better learning opportunities to enhance their skill set and advance their careers.However, those with hybrid working arrangements (78%) are more likely to agree with the above statement than those working fully on-site (63%) or fully remote (52%).Those who work full-time (71%) are also more likely to agree with the above statement than those who work part-time (56%).When examining this sentiment across industries, those who work in construction (76%) are more likely to agree with the above statement than those who work in leisure and hospitality (42%); education and health services (60%); and retail, trade, transportation, and utilities (59%).#3 The development opportunities desired by employees vary by their work arrangements (remote/on-site, full-time/part-time)Overall, data analytics (39%), computer (39%), software (37%), and marketing skills (36%), are the hard skills that employees feel they are lacking, holding them back from career advancement. When considering work arrangements, fully remote employees (45%) were more likely to say that a lack of marketing skills are holding them back than those fully on-site (33%) or hybrid (32%).Additionally, full-time employees (32%) were more likely to say that analytical skills are holding them back than part-time employees (25%).In terms of soft skills, the #1 soft skills employees say they feel are holding them back from career advancement are time management (43%), digital literacy (39%), and leadership skills (37%).When considering work arrangements, those fully on-site (46%) were more likely to say that digital literacy is holding them back than those working fully remote (34%) or hybrid (26%).#4 Employees value access to learning in different ways.Overall, the most desired types of career development opportunities are:Opportunities to prepare for a new job or promotion (58%).Employer-funded certifications in an area the employee wants to develop (57%).In-person training/lessons with subject matter experts (53%).Remote employees (58%) prefer access to a suite of online courses compared to on-site employees (43%).Conversely, on-site employees (58%) would prefer in-person training/lessons with subject matter experts compared to employees working remotely (47%) or hybrid (46%).Active workers (63%) prefer development opportunities that prepare them for a new job or promotion compared to sedentary workers (51%).How Employers Can Retain Employees by Prioritizing Professional DevelopmentConduct employee research on overall satisfaction with learning and development to identify gaps between different segments within your organization. Our survey found perceptions varied most by the work environment of employees (in-person, remote, or hybrid) and whether they are full-time or part-time, and whether they perform active or sedentary work. Differences can also be found among industry, where we found that employees working in Business/Professional services are by far the most satisfied with their career development opportunities compared to other industries. The industries reporting the most dissatisfaction were Financial Activities, Leisure/Hospitality, and Other Services.Once you understand the needs of different employee segments for the delivery of development opportunities, prioritize these needs and act quickly. It could be the difference between retaining or losing a good team member.As workers increasingly elect a remote or hybrid work environment, focus on understanding the distinct needs of these workers, the skills they need training on, and how they want to be trained. You may find some want in-person seminars, while others may want a self-paced online course. Our research finds remote workers and part-time workers are most likely to be dissatisfied with their current opportunities.Tailor hard and soft skills training opportunities to your employees' working arrangements. For example, on-site employees may prefer digital literacy training while remote employees might want to develop marketing skills.The Power of PaychexProviding robust training and development opportunities is keys to motivating, engaging, and retaining your employees.

(NASDAQ:SBUX) have fallen nearly 16% this year, but have staged a very strong rally ever since hitting a new 52-week low of $68.39 on May 12. Shares are higher by more than 43% ever since.A portion of these gains have taken place in the last two weeks, sparked in part by a consumer price index reading for October that showed inflation slowed to 7.7% for October to 8.2% in September. The annual inflation rate is the fourth consecutive month of slowing, with Octobers reading the lowest since January.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SBUX. Click here to check it out. SBUX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SBUXPeter Lynch Chart of SBUXAlso contributing to returns was an earnings report that showed Starbucks continues to demonstrate growth.Despite the gains since May, Starbucks looks like it still has more room to the upside. Lets dig deeper into the company and its most recent quarter to see why I believe gains can still be had.Earnings highlightsStarbucks reported fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2022 results on Nov. 3. Revenue grew 3.2% to $8.41 billion, which was $90 million more than analysts had anticipated. Adjusted earnings per share of 81 cents were below the $1 the company saw in the prior years fourth quarter, but results did beat estimates by 9 cents.For the fiscal year, revenue grew 11% to $32.3 billion, while adjusted earnings per share of $2.96 compared to $3.20.The all-important same-store sales were up 7% worldwide for the fourth quarter. The U.S. improved 11%, driven by a 10% increase in average ticket and a 1% improvement in comparable transactions. Consensus estimates were for growth of 7.6%. Much of the average ticket increase was due to price increases implemented over the past few quarters.Comparable sales for international markets declined 5% for the fourth quarter as transaction volumes fell 5% while average ticket was down 1%. Almost the entirety of the decrease was due to weakness in China stemming from Covid-19 restrictions in place. China same-store sales were down 24% as comparable transactions fell 22%. Excluding China, the second-biggest market for Starbucks outside of the U.S., comparable sales for international markets were up 30%.Story continuesStarbucks continues to expand aggressively, with the company opening 763 net new stores during the quarter. The company had a new record of 35,711 stores at the end of the quarter.On the downside, higher wages in North America stores were a significant overhang on margins. The operating margin for this region contracted 320 basis points to 18.6%. International margins were down even more, falling 750 basis points to 12.2% for the quarter, though much of this was due to closed stores in China.Analysts expect that Starbucks will earn $3.40 per share in fiscal year 2023, which would be a 15.6% improvement from the prior period. Revenue is projected to grow 11% to $35.86 billion.TakeawaysThe fourth quarter was largely a continuation of the strength seen during the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2022, North America and the U.S. both had same-store sales growth of 12%, mostly due to price increases, but the number of tickets increased 5% and 4%, respectively. International sales were down 9%, again due to weakness in China.Speaking of China, the restrictions placed on the population to quell further Covid-19 outbreaks weighed meaningfully on the performance of international markets. As a result, volume was way down.The weakness in this region is in regard to mobility of the population and not the opening of new stores. In fact, management said on the conference call that they are opening a record number of locations within China. Still, the nations leadership has not been shy about locking down parts of the country due to Covid-19 resurgence and likely would not in the future.Higher employee compensation did pressure margins, especially in North America. This has, and will likely be, an issue for those in the restaurant industry, especially with unemployment below 4% and the need for workers remaining high. Therefore, margins will continue to be lower than usual for Starbucks, though the worst of this could be lapped by the end of the next fiscal year.On the positive side, quarterly revenue was up slightly and followed a 31.3% increase in the same period of fiscal 2021 due to an incredibly strong response following the easing of pandemic conditions in much of the world.Throughout much of the last 15 years, Starbucks has generally showed impressive growth.Starbucks: The Rally Can ContinueAt its investor day in September, management outlined its goals for the coming years, with an expectation of U.S. same-store sales growth of 7% to 9% annually. The most recent fiscal year already topped this range and initial estimates for fiscal year 2023 are also above this level.There are several reasons as to why I believe Starbucks is capable of generating this type of comparable sales growth.The first item that shareholders should note is that demand outside of China was very strong, especially when considering the price increases the company had. Domestic sales were up mostly due to higher prices. Total transactions actually grew 1% from the prior year, showing the price increases did not negatively affect demand. The company also noted that its loyalty program grew 16% to nearly 29 million members in the U.S.Not only did price hikes not cause a drop in transaction volume, they did nothing to stop a surge in the number of Starbucks Rewards members. More than half of U.S. sales come from those enrolled in the loyalty program.Second, drive-through and mobile orders make up almost three-quarters of sales volume. When mobile order was first introduced, it was more of a mosh pit and the wait times were extensive. This has largely been corrected and remains an incredibly popular way for people to receive their orders.While the company will always be known for and rely on its coffee products, food sales showed strong sales growth, increasing 18% in 2022.Finally, Starbucks does not appear to be a mature company yet as it continues to open new stores. The company hit a new record for stores at the end of the fiscal year. Even in China, stores continue to be opened as Starbucks is looking beyond the near-term challenges of Covid-19.Valuation analysisShares of Starbucks are trading at 28.7 times forward earnings estimates, which is above the price-earnings ratio of 26 that the stock has averaged over the last decade. Based on the historical multiple, the stock is slightly overvalued.However, using a combination of historical multiples, past returns and growth as well as future estimates, the GF Value Line shows that Starbucks could have further room to run.Starbucks: The Rally Can ContinueStarbucks is currently trading with a price-to-GF Value of 0.84, implying a potential return of 18.7%. Factor in the stocks current yield of 2.2%, and total returns could push into the low 20% range.Final thoughtsStarbucks delivered a fourth-quarter result that beat both revenue and earnings estimates. Global comparable sales were up a high single-digit figure, with U.S. results comfortably ahead of forecasts. China is an issue as mobility within the country is subject to limits resulting from Covid-19 resurgences. Other international markets performed considerably better.The company has ambitious plans to grow domestic same-store sales, but is already ahead of those projections. Estimate for the new fiscal year show that analysts believe that double-digit top- and bottom-line growth is achievable.Starbucks should be able to reach its goals as price increases have done little to stop traffic and Starbucks Rewards continues to see high penetration levels.These factors are a major reason why the stock has climbed as much as it has since May, but shares still trade at a discount to their intrinsic value as calculated by GuruFocus. While the recent rally may turn off value investors, Starbucks appears to still offer a solid return from current levels.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

In times of financial volatility, investors focus on stocks that offer low risk with proven track records of dividend growth. Stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground in this context.Over the years, dividend growers have taken a significant place in investors’ portfolios. These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans. In an extended period of higher inflation, like the one we are confronted with today, dividend growth stocks provide a hedge against rising costs with stable income. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers reported an average annual return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return for non-dividend payers. During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%. This shows that dividend growth stocks offer an excellent way to generate passive income during inflationary periods.Dividend stocks have remained a significant component of total market returns in the past. In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks represented 8% of the total return in the first two years of this decade.Stephanie Link, a chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, spoke about dividend investments in her recent interview with Barron’s. She asserted that investors should focus on growing payouts instead of high dividends as dividend growth is of utmost importance in an inflationary environment. This report also highlighted that dividend shares in the S&amp;P 500 index reported an 11% decline this year as of October 29, compared with a 23% drop for non-dividend stocks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Charles River Associates CRAI, Murphy USA MUSA, Merck &amp; Co. MRK and New Fortress Energy NFE.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Cheers Softer Inflation Data: 5 Growth PicksFor the most part of this year, the U.S. stock market has been bleeding owing to stubbornly high inflation, compelling the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy. Consumer spending slowed down because of a hawkish Fed, and consequently, economic growth was disrupted.However, signs of inflation cooling down in the month of October increased investors’ risk appetite, and stocks logged their best rally since 2020 on Nov 10. The Dow surged more than 1,200 points yesterday and closed at its highest level since August.Similarly, the broader S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since Sep 12, while the tech-laden Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day rise in percentage point terms since March 2020.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in fact, noted that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 7.7% from a year ago in October. But the annual rise in inflation was down from September’s 8.2%. At the same time, the CPI increased less than expected in the prior month.What’s more, the core CPI, which excludes goods and service costs, rose 6.3% on an annual basis, slightly below September’s 6.6%, which was incidentally the highest year-over-year jump since August 1982.Nonetheless, thanks to such soft inflation data, the Fed is now widely expected to slow down its pace of rate hikes in the upcoming months, thereby propelling economic growth and boosting stock market returns.Lest we forget, the Fed has already approved its fourth-straight 0.75 percentage point rate hike in early November, taking the benchmark rate to between 3.75% and 4%, the highest in 14 years.Story continuesTalking about stock market returns, the period from November to January usually bodes well for Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500, on average, advanced 4.5% in the said period since 1936, more than its overall three-month average gain of 2.9%, per quantitative analysts at the Bank of America, citing a MarketWatch article.Additionally, stocks tend to do well after midterm elections. As mentioned in the Schwab article, since 1946, in 17 out of 19 midterms, the stock market has given better returns in the six-month period following an election compared to the six months leading up to it. On Nov 8, Americans already voted, so it’s now expected that the stock market would steadily scale upward.Banking on these positive developments, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks.

68,a2b4ee1a-452d-3af1-922b-bd5a2776e063,PM,2022-11-15,3 High-Yield Sin Stocks to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-sin-stocks-194251434.html,1668195771,STORY,"['DEO', 'TAP-A', 'PM']","[Environmental, social, governance (ESG) investing has been a major theme in recent years, as some investors seek exposure to stocks that are actively working on their environmental and social footprint. But it can make sense to look in the opposite direction, too. So-called sin stocks have often provided attractive returns. Sin stocks are a group of companies that produce and sell products that are deemed unhealthy, such as cigarettes and other tobacco products, alcohol and so on.Many of these product categories are very resilient during recessions. Consumers still buy cigarettes, spirits and so on during economic downturns. On top of that, since some investors do not want to invest in sin stocks, their valuations are oftentimes lower than those of other consumer goods companies, which allows for higher entry dividend yields and makes buybacks more effective.Last but not least, a lot of regulation in these product categories means that new market entrants have a hard time, which is why many sin stocks are operating in oligopolies that allow for high margins. The combination of these factors makes sin stocks worthy of research. These tailwinds can drive compelling total returns for those that invest in sin stocks. We will showcase three such sin stocks with attractive dividend yields here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPMPhilip Morris$93.92TAPMolson Coors$51.43DEODiageo$173.53Philip Morris (PM)Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockThe first of these sin stocks to buy is tobacco company Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). Philip Morris sells its products in almost all countries around the world, with the U.S. being an important exception — there, Altria (NYSE:MO) owns the rights to Marlboro and the other brands that Philip Morris controls.Smoking is not a growth market when it comes to sales volumes. However, tobacco companies have a history of increasing the price per pack over time. Despite volumes being flat or even down, tobacco companies have been able to generate solid revenue growth over time. At the same time, price increases allow Philip Morris to grow its margins over time, which is an additional tailwind for the company’s net profits.Story continuesSince cigarette sales volumes do not grow materially, there is no need to invest heavily in new production facilities or machinery. The vast majority of the operating cash flow that Philip Morris generates is thus available as free cash that can be used for dividends or share repurchases, which is why Philip Morris has been offering an attractive income yield for many years.Thanks to the recession-resistant business model, Philip Morris has also been able to grow its dividend very reliably, as the company has increased its dividend every year since it was spun off from Altria 15 years ago. At current prices, Philip Morris offers a dividend yield of 5.5%, which is quite attractive.Based on this year’s expected net profits, the payout ratio is relatively high, at 90%. However, Philip Morris has always operated with a high payout ratio, and it has not stopped the company from increasing its dividend each year. The strong U.S. dollar is a headwind for Philip Morris’ earnings this year, due to its large overseas exposure, but it is likely that the dollar will not continue to strengthen forever, which is why this headwind should wane eventually. This would allow for a lower payout ratio in the future.Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comMolson Coors (NYSE:TAP) is a beer and malt beverage company that has a history dating back almost 250 years. Molson Coors owns brands such as Coors Light, Miller Light, Carling and so on. On top of the U.S., it is also active in a range of additional markets in South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Molson Coors is not the largest beer company in the world, but it’s one with a long history and established brands.Beer demand is not very cyclical, which is why Molson Coors has generally fared well in past recessions. During the first year of the pandemic, its EPS declined only slightly. This was a result of a decline in sales at restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts and so on declined compared to previous years. In 2021, however, Molson Coors already saw its EPS expand again.Based on annual dividends of $1.52, Molson Coors is currently offering a dividend yield of 3%. That’s close to twice as high as the broad market’s dividend yield. Based on the expected net profit for the current year, Molson Coors’ payout ratio is just 39%. This looks very sustainable, especially when we consider that the company does not need to invest a large amount of its cash flows for capital expenditures. Therefore, its free cash conversion is high.Molson Coors reduced its dividend in 2020, and it remains below pre-pandemic levels for now. However, the low payout ratio should allow the company to get the dividend back up to the old $1.96-per-year level in the not-too-distant future.Diageo (DEO)a line up of black label whiskey to represent DEO stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDiageo (NYSE:DEO) is an alcoholic beverage company as well, although it focuses on spirits primarily. Its brands include Jonnie Walker, Smirnoff and Tanqueray. Its history dates back more than 300 years. The company remains headquartered in the U.K., where it was founded in the 17th century.Like Philip Morris and Molson Coors, Diageo has generally been resilient versus recessions and other macro shocks. Demand for alcoholic beverages is not very cyclical. In 2020, Diageo felt a small hit to its earnings, but the company has been hitting new record EPS levels in fiscal 2022 (it is currently in fiscal 2023, which is forecasted to be another record year).The company pays out 47% of its profits, based on this year’s expected EPS and an annual dividend of $4 per share. That makes for a dividend yield of 2.2% at current prices, which is the lowest among these three companies but still easily higher than the yield one can get from the broad market today.Diageo has a solid dividend-growth track record, having increased its dividend reliably in recent years. The dividend growth rate is in the mid-single digits, on average. At current prices, Diageo is trading for just below 20x this year’s expected net profit, which is a low-ish valuation relative to how Diageo was valued in the past. Diageo traded at earnings multiples of more than 20 over the last five years, suggesting right now might be a better-than-average time to enter or expand a position.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are three of the biggest companies in the world that have all hit 52-week lows this month.With a recession looming and a bear market having taken hold this year, it’s not surprising that many stocks are hovering around 52-week lows. It is rare to see so many high quality stocks get beaten down to the degree they have in recent months however. The four most popular stocks among hedge funds have all touched 52-week lows since November 3, creating a great opportunity for investors to buy low on some of the most respected companies in the world.Scanning the market for stocks at 52-week lows is a time-honored tradition among value investors, who covet the opportunity to buy quality companies with long track records of success at discounted prices. In many cases, such companies are merely caught in cyclical lows, without any real change to their long-term fundamental outlook that justifies their shares trading at their lowest point in a year or more.There are several technical reasons why stocks at 52-week lows can make good short-term buys as well. As stocks reach new yearly lows, short sellers are more likely to have profited from their positions and will look to buy shares to cover them. Bargain hunters, like the aforementioned value investors, are also more likely to start buying shares when they cross the 52-week low threshold, which can provide them with an immediate, though potentially short-lived, boost.That doesn’t mean every stock at a 52-week low is necessarily poised for a rebound however, either in the short or long term, which is evidenced by multiple stocks on this list, which have fallen to 2+ year lows. If you had bought these stocks earlier this year expecting a rebound by this point, you’d be sorely disappointed, as they’ve continued to trend down amid the tough economic backdrop.Story continuesAs with any investment decision, investors need to ask themselves why these stocks are at 52-week lows and whether their long-term outlook has changed enough in the last year to justify those new lows. If that doesn’t appear to be the case, it could be that the stock was simply overvalued a year ago and has fallen back to a more realistic valuation, which has happened to quite a number of growth stocks this year.We’ll try to answer some of those burning questions in this article as we take a look at 10 of the best 52-Week Low Stocks to buy now.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following 52-week low stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now10. Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 39 1-Year Share Price Decline: 36% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are several stocks worth buying now that have all hit 52-week lows within the last week. Another is medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), whose shares touched a 52-week low on November 4, a week after the release of the company’s Q3 results.Edwards Lifesciences shares fell by 17.9% on October 28 after the company announced Q3 sales of $1.32 billion and pro forma EPS of $0.61, both of which represented slight misses compared to consensus estimates. Sales grew just 1% year-over-year during the quarter, but 7% on a constant currency basis. The company’s Q4 pro forma EPS guidance of between $2.40 and $2.50 also fell below estimates, as well as the company’s earlier guidance. Despite the sell off and EW shares hitting a 52-week low, they still trade at 31.2x earnings, which is rich given the tepid Q3 growth, but the company looks to have a compelling long-term growth runway ahead of it.Hedge fund ownership of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) dipped by 13% during Q2 after ticking up for two straight quarters. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in EW as of June 30 among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 7.33 million shares worth $697 million.Wedgewood Partners believes that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)’s growth should accelerate in the years to come, as discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) reported just +5% growth in revenue (foreign exchange adjusted) compared to a year ago. While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global healthcare systems emerging from pandemic disruptions. The Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system, PASCAL, and also presented compelling related clinical data, which should help support accelerating growth over the next few years. As for Edwards’ core TAVR system, there continues to be a (unfortunately) pent-up, untreated population suffering from severe aortic stenosis that will finally be able to find their way back into healthcare systems as labor market pressures ease.”9. Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 1-Year Share Price Decline: 18% Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares hit a 52-week low on November 3 following the release of its Q3 results and underwhelming billings guidance for Q4. The cybersecurity company’s Q3 results were pretty good, as sales rose by 33% year-over-year to $1.15 billion, slightly topping estimates, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 65% from a year earlier to $0.33 and easily beat consensus.Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)’s Q4 billings guidance left something to be desired with investors however, coming up short of the $1.74 billion consensus estimate, even at the top end of the company’s range. Management cited the uncertain macro-economic environment when drawing up its guidance, which may have caused additional near-term investor concerns. Longer-term, Fortinet looks like a strong bet to continue growing at a steady pace in the burgeoning cybersecurity space, which makes its recent weakness a good buying opportunity.Hedge funds sold off Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) in droves shortly into the pandemic, with the stock hitting a 7-year low in smart money ownership at the end of Q1 2021. There’s been an 83% surge in the number of funds long FTNT since then, including a 13% rise in Q2 2022. The company’s biggest bulls were all loading up on shares in Q2, as seven of the eight funds with the largest Fortinet holdings as of June 30 increased the size of their stakes by at least 360% during the quarter.8. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 1-Year Share Price Decline: 34.2% The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shares hit a 52-week (and 2-year) low on November 2, but have since rebounded by 20% in the last week. The cosmetic company’s sales fell by 11% year-over-year during its Q1 of fiscal year 2023, sliding to $3.93 billion, while organic net sales dipped by 5%. Adjusted earnings tumbled by 28% year-over-year to $1.37 per diluted share.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) anticipates a rough fiscal Q2 due to various headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar and tighter inventory management among retailers. The company projects diluted earnings will fall by as much as 54% year-over-year during the quarter. Management expects those headwinds to begin abating in the second half of its fiscal 2023 however, with a return to strong organic sales and adjusted EPS growth.Hedge fund ownership of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shot up during the first quarter of 2021, but has fallen by 24% since then. It has ticked up slightly this year as shares have fallen however, as hedge funds appear to like EL’s upside potential at the current depressed prices. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP owns 5.95 million EL shares as of June 30, with 6.68% 13F exposure to the stock. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates cut its stake in the company by 16% during Q2 to own 612,560 shares at the end of the quarter.7. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 1-Year Share Price Decline: 20.7% Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) shares tumbled to a 3-year low on November 3 despite the company soundly beating revenue estimates with its third quarter results. The fintech company grew revenue by 3.8% year-over-year during Q3 to $2.29 billion, beating estimates by $250 million. Adjusted EPS rose $0.30 year-over-year to $2.48, which matched estimates. On a constant currency basis, Global Payments expects to grow revenue by 10% to 11% this year.The 3-year low for GPN shares was spite of the company finding a buyer for its Netspend consumer business earlier this year, which netted the company $1 billion in cash and will allow it to focus on its primary B2B operations.Hedge fund ownership of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) peaked at the end of Q3 2021, but has fallen for the past three straight quarters as shares have started to tumble. There’s been a 16% decline in the number of funds long GPN during that period. Larry Robbins’ healthcare-focused Glenview Capital Management is a firm bull on GPN, owning 2.35 million shares on June 30, with the stock ranking as the fund’s top non-healthcare pick.Manole Capital Management has been a long time bull of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) and had this to say about the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Over the next week or so, we will be publishing a stock-specific note on payment processor Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN). We have owned GPN for nearly two decades and it currently is one of our largest positions. We will begin by highlighting recent spending trends, eCommerce developments and how many of our payment companies can actually benefit from inflation and higher costs. We will discuss their business, industry trends, what is driving their growth, and then highlight their compelling valuation.”6. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 62 1-Year Share Price Decline: 31.5% Closing out the first half of the list is Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), whose shares hit a 2-year low on November 4. The animal healthcare giant slashed its 2022 sales guidance by between $150 million and $225 million on November 3, in addition to cutting its earnings projections, which triggered a flight from the stock. The company cited several headwinds as being contributors to the weaker projections, including unfavorable currency exchange rates, supply chain obstacles, and staffing challenges at veterinarian offices. The company otherwise remains bullish on its long-term outlook and growth catalysts thanks to its pipeline and global scale, predicting market-beating sales growth in the years to come.Hedge fund ownership of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) hit an all-time high at the end of Q1 even as shares started tumbling, though there was a slight pullback in Q2. Barry Dargan’s Intermede Investment Partners and Nicolai Tangen’s Ako Capital each owned more than 1 million ZTS shares on September 30 and had 4.39% and 3% 13F exposure to the stock respectively.The Baron Health Care Fund talked about some of the recent developments at Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Zoetis Inc., the global leader in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of companion and farm animal health medicine and vaccines, fell along with shares of other high-multiple 2021 standout performers. We retain conviction as Zoetis recently reported a top and bottom line beat with more than 21% growth driven by dermatology, parasiticides, and recently launched monoclonal osteoarthritic treatments. The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are three of the most popular stocks in the world that can currently be had for bargain basement prices.

Perhaps they did a little too much too-- they've diluted the brand. So a lot of people are like, it's too much. It's losing its worth. And in that same note, he said that Hasbro could fall 34% due to the company ruining the ""Magic the Gathering"" card game. So when you have one game responsible for that much, not a good sign. You have to be more diverse than that.DAVE BRIGGS: 15% of revenue, and it's tough-- another softening indication of the economy.]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Hologic's (NASDAQ:HOLX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Hologic, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$9.1b - US$938m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Hologic has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Hologic roceIn the above chart we have measured Hologic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hologic here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWe like the trends that we're seeing from Hologic. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 20%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 33%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Hologic thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.One more thing to note, Hologic has decreased current liabilities to 10% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors. This tells us that Hologic has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.Story continuesIn Conclusion...A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Hologic has. And with a respectable 90% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Like most companies, Hologic does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The stock rose more than 3.5% in afternoon trading on Tuesday.In a new note published early Tuesday morning, Bank of America Analyst Jessica Reif reinstated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $370 a share (+24% upside potential).""Our valuation accounts for Netflix's leading position within the still burgeoning shift towards non-linear video viewing, a strong runway for subscriber growth outside of the US (particularly across developing markets), upside from the initial advertising video on demand (AVOD) offering as well as its ramping profitability and strengthening [free cash flow] profile,"" the analyst wrote.Reif went on to explain that, despite near-term macroeconomic challenges and greater competition within the ad space overall, Netflix's ad tier will add to its ability to drive engagement and will increase incremental revenue and subscriber growth over time.The analyst also underscored the potential of ""extraordinary advertiser demand"" for Netflix's inventory, citing the platform's ability to reach younger demographics and offer exposure to cord-cutters and cord-nevers (who have never used cable services).She argued that this will increase the likelihood of Netflix receiving a premium cost per 1,000 impressions (CPM) while the platform's partnership with Microsoft on the ad-tier limits potential downside.""Extraordinary Attorney Woo.""

The company said it will stop giving guidance on paid memberships moving forward due to its introduction of new revenue streams. For now, though, Netflix estimated an addition of 4.5 million subscribers next quarter (above prior forecasts of 3.9 million.)Netflix attributed its success in the quarter to several TV and film hits, including ""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,"" ""Stranger Things S4,"" ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" ""The Gray Man,"" and ""Purple Hearts.""On the October 18 earnings call, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company, which has committed to spend $17 billion on content in 2022, is working to get ""better and better"" at securing ""more impact per $1 billion spend than anybody else.""

From rulemaking to enforcement, the agency is pushing boundaries and expanding its reach into new and active areas of the market. Here, we provide updates on the Commission’s activity in several high-priority areas, including ESG, insider trading, ephemeral messaging, and the clawback of executive incentive-based compensation.ESG Regulation and Enforcement Using Preexisting Rules and Historical Causes of ActionSEC Chair Gary Gensler recently spoke about how various types of crypto technology, like “crypto token, stablecoin, or decentralized finance platform (DeFi) . . . are covered by [existing] securities laws.”1 Paraphrasing Aristotle, Gensler concluded, “[t]reat like cases alike.”2 Those observations mirrored earlier comments by Commissioner Hester M. Peirce on ESG regulation and enforcement:We can bring, and already have brought, greenwashing cases using existing rules, so why is additional rulemaking necessary? Should our focus instead be on identifying where there may be gaps in Commission rules and tailor[ing] any new rulemaking accordingly, rather than producing a new rule that is arguably redundant?3Such comments may reflect an institutional preference for amending preexisting rules and relying on historical causes of action rather than inventing new theories for ESG regulation and enforcement. This focus is evident in recent rulemaking, investigations, and enforcement actions — specifically, proposed amendments to the Names Rule, recent administrative proceedings against Bank of New York Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. (“BNY Mellon”), and an ongoing investigation into Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”).Proposed Amendments to the Names RuleThe Names Rule was adopted two decades ago to protect the public from “materially deceptive and misleading [fund] name[s].”4 Among other things, it forbids names “suggesting guarantee or approval by the United States government.”5 The rule also prohibits names which suggest that a fund focuses on “certain investments or industries,” “certain countries or geographic regions,” or has “[t]ax-exempt” status, unless the fund’s name accurately reflects “at least 80%” of the value of its assets.6 This is also known as the 80% rule.Story continuesThe SEC recognizes when a fund’s name includes the term “ESG” or “similar terminology,”7 that “[i]nvestors may reasonably expect [such] funds . . . to invest in companies with policies, practices, or characteristics that are consistent with these standards.”8 The proposed amendments to the Names Rule would provide that “fund names with ESG and similar terminology . . . are subject to the rule’s 80% investment policy requirement.”9 The amendments would also “defin[e] certain uses of ESG terminology in fund names as materially deceptive and misleading.”10 The purpose of both amendments would be to stamp out “greenwashing.”11Among the proposals the SEC is considering is whether the names of “integration funds” should be categorically deemed to be “materially deceptive or misleading” if those names indicate that a fund’s “investment decisions incorporate one or more ESG factors.”12 The SEC is also mulling over whether a fund’s investment policy “must address each element in the fund name that suggests an investment focus.”13 For instance, a fund named “XYZ Environmental, Social, and Governance Fund” may be required to “adopt an 80% investment policy to address all three of those elements.”14On October 7, 2022, the SEC reopened the comment period for the proposed amendments to the Names Rule.15 So, it remains to be seen whether these amendments will emerge intact. For the time being, this serves as a useful reminder to embrace progress while keeping one foot firmly planted in the past, where much of the regulatory action still is.Settlement with Bank of New York Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc.For companies concerned with ESG, the SEC has emphasized that “all three of those elements” matter.16 However, “G,” for governance, is sometimes overlooked.17 This may be a risky assumption, as seen in a recent settled administrative action against BNY Mellon, and a private lawsuit and ongoing SEC investigation into Activision Blizzard.BNY Mellon recently found itself the subject of an administrative proceeding. At issue were alleged misstatements and omissions about how ESG principles informed the investment decisions of certain funds it advised.18 The decisional processes of two funds, the “Sustainable Funds” and the “Overlay Funds,” were scrutinized closely.19 Investment decisions for the Sustainable Funds always required adherence to a “proprietary ESG quality review.”20 To pass muster, securities had to “demonstrate attractive investment attributes and sustainable business practices,” and could not have any “material unresolvable environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.”21 By contrast, investment decisions for the Overlay Funds were “not subject to that specific investment criteria.”22But the SEC found that BNY Mellon misrepresented in board minutes and prospectuses the extent to which ESG quality reviews were part of the investment process of the Overlay Funds.23 The following statement was viewed as misleading:Integrated into the investment process [is] a well-established approach to responsible investment. This process includes identifying and considering the [ESG] risks, opportunities and issues through the research process via . . . proprietary quality reviews, in an effort to ensure that any material ESG issues are considered.24This was because “[a] reasonable investor . . . could mistakenly conclude that all portfolio holdings selected [for the Overlay Fund] were subject to an ESG quality review.”25 Also problematic was an RFP response which stated that, as part of the “due diligence process ahead of investing, each security being considered for investment . . . must have an ESG quality review conducted.”26The SEC concluded BNY Mellon had willfully violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act, and Rules 206(4)-8 and 206(4)-7 promulgated thereunder, and had also violated Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, which prohibit fraud or deceit and untrue statements or omissions of material fact.27 Without admitting or denying any of the SEC’s findings, BNY Mellon agreed to an order requiring that it cease and desist from current and future violations, a censure, and a penalty payment of $1,500,000.28Investigation into Activision Blizzard, Inc.Activision Blizzard has been the subject of an investigation for different governance reasons. It started when a federal class action lawsuit claimed that Activision Blizzard had violated federal securities law by misleading investors, in significant part, through its 2020 ESG Report:Plaintiffs allege that [the ESG Report’s] provisions regarding no toleration of retaliation were materially false and misleading because during the Class Period retaliation against female employees of the Company who made sexual harassment and discrimination claims was rampant and tolerated by the Company.29While the plaintiffs’ first two complaints were dismissed, they recently filed a third amended complaint, reasserting their claims that Activision Blizzard’s public commitment to ESG materially misled investors.30 Activision Blizzard has also announced that the SEC is investigating the company on “employment matters and related issues.”31It is unclear whether any formal enforcement will materialize out of the Activision Blizzard investigation. Regardless, in light of administrative proceedings brought against BNY Mellon and other companies32 based upon their internal and external compliance efforts, this may indicate the form that future SEC enforcement may take against companies seeking to implement ESG protocols, especially in the area of governance.Insider Trading Enforcement Based on Companies’ Own Insider Trading Language and PoliciesIn another trend, the language and provisions of several companies’ own insider trading policies have played a significant role in helping the Commission expand its insider trading litigation. While the SEC has made reference to companies’ insider trading policies in prior enforcement actions, those references have generally served to establish scienter.33 And when the SEC has tried to use the provisions of a company’s own insider trading policies to expand the definition of insider trading in the past, those efforts have often failed.34 In a recent line of cases, however, the specific language and provisions of companies’ own insider trading policies have been outcome determinative.In SEC v. Jun, for example, particular provisions of Netflix’s insider trading policies were central to the SEC’s enforcement theory.35 Jun involved an insider trading ring that traded on tips about Netflix’s subscription information.36 That information was passed on at various times by three members of the circle, who were software and data engineers at Netflix.37 Of note, the SEC relied almost entirely upon Netflix’s “company policies, including its insider trading policy,” to establish that Netflix’s “periodic subscriber numbers” were material and confidential information.38Similarly, in SEC v. Panuwat, the specific language of Medivation’s insider trading policy was critical. Panuwat, an employee of Medivation, Inc., traded in short-term call options in a peer company, Incyte Corp., after learning that Pfizer was about to acquire Medivation.39 Panuwat challenged the SEC’s complaint for failing to show he had breached any duty owed to Medivation through his trading in Incyte. The SEC responded by citing to Medivation’s own insider trading policy, which broadly prohibited the use of nonpublic information to trade in “the securities of another publicly traded company.”40 In particular, the SEC seized upon the fact that Medivation’s policy used the expansive word “including” to provide a non-exclusive list of types of publicly traded companies.41Finally, in SEC v. Cavco Indus., Inc., Cavco’s investment and insider trading policies were used to support an action ancillary to a classic § 10(b) violation.42 Cavco’s corporate investment policy required it “to maintain surplus cash in a ‘low-risk, high credit quality portfolio’ such as money market accounts and Treasury bonds.”43 Before any investments could be made outside those guidelines, they needed to be approved “by both the CEO and CFO and reported to the Board of Directors.”44 The SEC sued the defendants for securities fraud in violation of § 10(b) and insufficient accounting controls in violation of § 13(b)(2)(B).45 In doing so, it relied on a step-by-step analysis of the company’s own investment and internal trading policies, describing how the trades were an improper use of “surplus cash,” and emphasizing how the trades were not disclosed to Cavco’s CEO, CFO, and board.46It is too soon to tell whether this trend is here to stay or what it forebodes. For now, market participants would be advised to work with inside and outside counsel to scrutinize their insider trading and investment policies to ensure they are not creating unintended liability and that their internal procedures around insider trading police the full scope of liability created by their policies.Ephemeral MessagingEphemeral messaging refers to the use of applications like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram to send “‘self-destructing’ messages that are deleted automatically after they are viewed or some set amount of time after they are sent.”47On October 13, 2021, the Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, opined on the need for a shift in SEC priorities, because “trust in our institutions is faltering.”48 Among other enforcement priorities, he advocated for the “robust enforcement of laws and rules concerning . . . violation[s] of record-keeping obligations.”49 Grewal specifically criticized the deliberate use of “ephemeral technology that allows messages to disappear.”50Less than a year later, the Commission responded to Grewal’s call.51 On September 27, 2022, the SEC announced sanctions against several firms for violating record-keeping rules. Those firms included Barclays, Citigroup, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and several others.52 In addition to being ordered to establish comprehensive compliance regimes within the year, each firm was required to pay civil penalties between $10 million and $125 million. All told, the eleven firms paid fines totaling $1.16 billion.53The infringing conduct constituted using personal text messaging services and other “off-channel” communication platforms like WhatsApp for communications “related to the business of the broker dealer,” and failing to “maintain or preserve” those communications.54 The Commission relied principally on Rules 17a-4 and 17a-4(b)(4) under the Exchange Act. Both rules were promulgated pursuant to the power granted under Section 17(a)(1) to issue record-keeping rules governing broker-dealers.55The SEC noted violations not just by junior employees, but managing directors and senior supervisors as well.56The SEC explained further that “recordkeeping requirements are an integral part of the investor protection function of the Commission and other securities regulators, in that the preserved records are the primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable securities laws, including antifraud provisions and financial responsibility standards.”57 And so, it expressed concern that during the relevant time periods that the firms were using ephemeral messaging technology, they were also receiving and responding to subpoenas in other unrelated investigations. The SEC emphasized that the firms’ failure to maintain or preserve records “likely impacted the Commission’s ability to carry out its regulatory functions and investigate violations of the federal securities laws across [those other] investigations.”58It is uncertain whether the SEC has reserved the right to bring further enforcement based upon the impact of the firms’ record-keeping failures on other unrelated investigations. For now, this is a space to watch closely. Furthermore, as accounting practices, corporate transparency, and record-keeping generally fall under the umbrella of governance within an ESG framework, this further underscores the importance of paying attention to “all three of those elements.”59Clawback Rules for Executive Incentive-Based CompensationOn October 26, 2022, the SEC announced that it had adopted a final rule requiring exchanges and issuers to develop and implement policies pertaining to the mandatory recovery of executive incentive-based compensation (“EIBC”) overpaid due to an issuer’s noncompliance with financial reporting requirements, as well as disclosure policies regarding the same — the so-called Clawback Rule. The Rule was proposed in 2015 to implement, for the first time, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act, an amendment added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.60 The proposal went dormant under Chairman Clayton, appointed under the Trump administration, until the comment period was reopened in October 2021. Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw described the Rule as being rooted in equitable concerns: “it is unfair to shareholders for corporations to allow executives to retain compensation that they were awarded erroneously.”61Section 10D(b) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission: (1) to make rules requiring companies to develop and implement mandatory recovery policies for clawing back excessive EIBC overpaid due to an issuer’s “material noncompliance” with “any financial reporting requirement” during the “3-year period” preceding the date on which the company is required to prepare an “accounting restatement”; and (2) to make rules requiring companies to develop and implement disclosure policiespertaining to the same.62Disclosure Policies. The Commission’s new disclosure rules require companies, among other things, to: (i) indicate on the cover of Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F if an accounting restatement is published during the relevant reporting period;63 (ii) file their internal mandatory recovery policies as exhibits to annual reports on Forms 10-K, 20-F or 40-F, or for registered management investment companies, on Form N-CSR;64 (iii) disclose how recovery policies have been applied by a company during a given reporting period under Item 402;65 and (iv) disclose various additional information in Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”), “a structured (i.e. machine-readable) data language.”66Mandatory Recovery Policies. In Section 10D(b), Congress provided that the mandatory duty to recover erroneously awarded EIBC should be triggered only when an erroneous award is the result of a company’s “material noncompliance” with financial reporting rules. Although the Rule incorporates a materiality standard,67 Commissioners Peirce and Mark. T. Uyeda have criticized the Commission for defining the term “material” to include both “Big R” and “little r” accounting restatements, which may “require [the] clawback of de minimis amounts.”68 While the Commission has certainly shown an increasing preference for a broad treatment of “materiality” in different settings, it has generally assured market participants that the term will be construed in a manner “consistent with applicable case law.”69 Critics contend, however, that the Clawback Rule strains the meaning of materiality to its limits, in “conflict with the statutory directive.”70This seems to be by design, as the Commission aims to capture any and all erroneously awarded EIBC. In the Commission’s view, the Rule requires the recovery of “any incentive-based compensation that may be impacted by financial reporting.”71 The Rule was thus drafted “with the view that discretion to implement and execute [clawback] policies . . . should be limited.”72 At the same time, it was drafted with an understanding that these “policies were intended to apply broadly.”73 This dual heuristic has had two consequences.First, the Commission has stripped boards of directors of the discretion to determine whether an error is “material” — that is to say, whether it requires “Big R” or “little r” accounting restatements.74 “Big R” restatements involve corrections to “historical financial statements” of “errors that were material to those previously issued financial statements.”75 By contrast, “little r” restatements typically “deal with immaterial misstatements, or adjustments made in the normal course of business” and are “not generally viewed as a sign of poor reporting.”76 But, as mentioned previously, the Clawback Rule’s definition of “material error[] . . . include[s] both.”77 The Commission has also explained that “[w]hile an initial error amount may not have been material to previously issued financial statements, it may become material due to its cumulative effect over multiple reporting periods.”78Second, the Commission has adopted an “intentionally broad definition of executive officer.”79 The Senate Banking Committee understood Section 10D(b) to authorize rulemaking requiring mandatory recovery from only “a very limited number of employees.”80 But the Clawback Rule defines “executive officer” to include, among others, “any other officer who performs a policy-making function.”81 The scope of mandatory recovery is also not limited to just “those officers who may be ‘at fault’ for accounting errors . . . nor to those who are directly responsible for the preparation of the financial statements.”82The Rule thus requires the implementation of clawback and disclosure policies pertaining to the incentive-based compensation awarded to any officer who performs a policy-making function. Furthermore, it triggers the duty of mandatory recovery when an erroneous award is the result of a company’s noncompliance with any financial rule, as defined by an exceedingly broad (and potentially illusory) standard of materiality.The “Impracticability” Exception. The Rule contains at least one safeguard for companies — referred to as the “impracticability” exception — wherein recovery may not be required if: (i) “[t]he direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the policy would exceed the amount recovered”; (ii) “[r]ecovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to [the Rule’s publication in the Federal Register]”; or (iii) “[r]ecovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan . . . to fail to meet the requirements of [26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(13) or 411(a)] and any regulations thereunder.”83 Even so, Commissioner Peirce, dissenting from the rule, described the exception “itself [as] impracticable,” since it imposes significant costs on any company seeking to take advantage of it.84 This is because, before the exception applies, a company must first make “a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation” and document and report the same, or first “obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the applicable national securities exchange or association.”85The time for compliance is short. Each exchange is required to file “proposed listing standards” no later than 90 days following the Rule’s publication in the Federal Register.86 Those standards must be effective within “one year” after the Rule’s publication.87 Once that occurs, issuers will have only 60 days to adopt and implement their own mandatory recovery policies.88 In these circumstances, market participants are advised to begin working with counsel immediately to discuss the drafting and implementation of mandatory recovery and disclosure policies, and to seek advice on structuring executive compensation and benefits — and insider trading policies, internal controls around ESG disclosures, and more — to reflect this new landscape of risk.1 Statement, Gary Gensler, Chair, U.S. Sec. &amp; Exch.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 18.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $112.72 in the previous session. Phillips 66 has gained 53.6% since the start of the year compared to the 44% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 44.8% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2022, Phillips 66 reported EPS of $6.46 versus consensus estimate of $4.98.For the current fiscal year, Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $20.88 per share on $169.32 billion in revenues. This represents a 266.32% change in EPS on a 47.43% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $14.23 per share on $149.92 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -31.84% and -11.46%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPhillips 66 may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Phillips 66 has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 5.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 5.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.8X versus its peer group's average of 11.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Phillips 66 currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Phillips 66 passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Phillips 66 shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does PSX Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of PSX have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PBF Energy Inc. (PBF). PBF has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. PBF Energy Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 32.01%, and for the current fiscal year, PBF is expected to post earnings of $10.49 per share on revenue of $45.01 billion.Shares of PBF Energy Inc. have gained 15% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 2.03X and a P/CF of 30.53X.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 2% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PSX and PBF, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and 8x8 (EGHT) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 29.8% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this telecommunications services company well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. EGHT meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 40.5% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for EGHT is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.32. This indicates that the stock moves 32% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that EGHT has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped EGHT earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, EGHT is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. EGHT is currently trading at 0.90 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 90 cents for each dollar of sales.So, EGHT appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to EGHT, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, Homesense and HomeGoods",MoneyWise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-trust-compare-prices-17-120000046.html,1668513600,STORY,['TJX'],"[Don't trust 'Compare At' prices — 17 tricks for shopping at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, Homesense and HomeGoodsWhether you’re looking for designer clothes or stylish decor for your new home, you can sometimes unearth incredible finds at the TJX family of stores.That includes the namesake T.J. Maxx along with sister stores Marshalls, Sierra, Homesense and HomeGoods. These retailers feature a variety of marked-down and clearance items from high-end companies and lesser-known brands.You’re likely to snag some savings, but you might do even better if you know the tricks. Since the stores are all owned by the same company, there are some common tactics you can use to turn a good haul into a great one.Don't missWant to invest your spare change but don't know where to start? There's an app for thatYou’re probably overpaying when you shop online — get this free tool before Black FridayA TikToker paid off $17,000 in credit card debt by cash stuffing — can it work for you?1. Shop on weekday mornings2p2play / Shutterstock.comYou’ll want to avoid the weekend traffic at nearly any store you shop at, but enthusiasts say the best times for shopping at T.J. Maxx stores are weekday mornings.The stores receive their shipments overnight, so mornings are an ideal time to shop, according to Christine Lee of the HomeGoods Obsessed fan page.""Mondays are usually catch-up days from the busy weekend, so Wednesday, Thursday or Friday are your best bet,"" Lee told Good Housekeeping magazine in 2019.You can also ask one of the staff at your local store to let you know when they usually restock and set out some time in your day to go treasure hunting.2. Look closely for brand knockoffsVeri Keri / YouTubeThink you’ve scored a fantastic deal on a name brand coat? Check the inside tag first.Retail expert Ron Hess told News4 in 2019 that some items sold at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls could have a ""TJX"" label — denoting that they could be licensed items manufactured specifically for the discount stores.Hess added that a licensed item might not be of the same quality or fit as what you’d expect from a designer label. So that “Compare At” price could be pretty misleading.Story continues3. Double check for discount duplicatesSometimes you’ll find yourself a nice Ralph Lauren polo for $19.99 but find the exact same piece in the store for $5 less.That can happen when T.J. Maxx purchases the same item from different vendors or the staff misses some items while marking down. Take a sweep of the store — particularly the clearance racks — to make sure you’ve got the lowest priced version.And keep in mind that you can’t ask for a price adjustment on an item after you buy it just because the price drops a day or two later. None of the stores under the T.J. Maxx umbrella offer this service.4. Get designer brands for lessMs. PinkSecrets / YouTubeYou can find anything from Burberry eyeglasses to Diesel jeans in The Runway department at T.J. Maxx.The Runway carries the designer brands that every Maxxinista dreams of, all at ridiculously low prices. Michelle Madhok, online shopping expert and founder of deals site shefinds.com, told digital culture magazine Mic in 2017 that you can score some high-end deals for up to 70% off.Not every T.J. Maxx location holds a Runway department, though. You can either shop online or use the store locator to find a store near you that features the collection. Just look for the “R” symbol.5. Know the differencesJohn Greim / ShutterstockThe TJX family of stores has plenty of similarities, but it’s important to know the differences before you start shopping to save yourself a second trip.T.J. Maxx and Marshalls function like department stores, selling everything from pet supplies to cosmetics. Sierra sells many of the same products but is geared more toward outdoor apparel and athletic wear. Homesense and HomeGoods focus on furniture and decor.While T.J. Maxx is better known for designer items and jewelry, particularly with its The Runway collection, Marshalls carries more footwear and has an expanded men’s department and a junior department known as The Cube.Meanwhile, Homesense tends to have a bigger selection than HomeGoods, according to Cosmopolitan.6. Ask for discounts on damaged itemsIf you find a cute sweater with a stain that you know a couple of good washes will fix, try asking the cashier at the checkout for a discount.Assuming the item hasn’t already been marked down for damage, shoppers say, store employees can give you a discount at their discretion.However, if the item has an “As Is” tag attached to it, that means someone’s noticed the damage and marked it down already.7. ‘If you love it, grab it!’2p2play / Shutterstock.comIf you spot an item you really want, you probably shouldn’t hold off until the next time you stop at the store.The Marshalls website says, “We don't hold replenishment stock in our back rooms and the store managers often don't even know what's coming until they throw open the delivery truck doors!”Lee also told Good Housekeeping that products are usually launched in a few stores to check whether they perform well before getting distributed throughout the country.Read more: Grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock market with these 3 easy alternatives8. Decode the price tagsRoman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comAccording to a few different sites, TJX price tags have their very own color scheme to tell you whether you’re getting a primo deal.The white tags are for regular-priced items, and red tags indicate clearance prices — no mystery there. At T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, however, you’ll also come across yellow tags that flag final clearance prices and blue tags that let you know the item has a coordinating piece (like a matching skirt to go with a blouse).And if you come across a purple tag, you’ve found a designer item at T.J. Maxx, from its The Runway collection.9. Consider the TJX credit card carefullyThis one’s for the regulars. It could be worth signing up for the TJX rewards credit card if you find yourself stopping at any one of these stores each week.The rewards card gets you an extra 10% discount on your first purchase, and you’ll earn points equal to 5% of the money you spend that you can later redeem for store credit. You’ll even receive invites to some exclusive, members-only shopping events.There’s no annual fee, but be aware that the APR is very high, even among credit cards. Don’t get the card if there’s a chance you might carry a balance from month to month and slide into debt.10. Ignore the 'Compare At' pricesVeri Keri / YouTubeDon’t be too swayed by the high competitor prices listed on the tags at TJX stores.Discount retailers like T.J. Maxx use the tactic of “price anchoring” — setting your expectations of how much an item should cost — to convince you you’re getting an amazing deal. But the “Compare At” number doesn’t necessarily represent the cheapest alternative or even the going rate.Class-action lawsuits were filed against TJX Companies in 2015 and 2018, alleging the Compare At prices are essentially “fictional.” On its website, TJX says the number represents the regular retail price at “full-price department or specialty retailers,” and if identical items aren’t available elsewhere, it compares with products of a “similar type, quality and style.”In the end, it’s always better to do your own research instead.11. Keep an eye out for old makeupLeah Janae / YouTubeYou might be able to snag that Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit for half the price at a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls.The discount stores offer some high-end makeup products in their beauty aisles for much less than you would pay at Ulta or Sephora.Don’t get too carried away by the cheap prices, though. News4 Investigates reported in 2019 that it couldn’t find expiration dates on any of the products examined in T.J. Maxx stores, but there’s no telling how long they’ve been sitting on shelves for.Open and inspect the products if you can for any damage or signs of age. A stale smell can be a good indicator of makeup gone bad.12. Save by signing up for the email listIf you don’t want another credit card padding out your wallet, take advantage of the free bonuses you get when you sign up for the email list at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or Sierra.You get free shipping on your first online order as well as notifications about new arrivals and exclusive offers.You can even keep track of your order history for the past six months on your account with T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.13. Use your T.J. Maxx gift card at other storesdennizn / Shutterstock.comGot a T.J. Maxx gift card on your birthday? You’re not just restricted to the one store.The gift cards can be redeemed at any T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods store.You can also use these cards in conjunction with other promotions or your TJX Rewards from the credit card.14. Beware of bedding and bath towelsNJShoreBeachLife / YouTubeJoanie Demer, one of the founders of The Krazy Coupon Lady blog, told ABC27 News in 2020 that customers might find better deals at other stores when it comes to sheets and towels.She suggested going to Target or Macy’s during a White Sale for cheaper prices and also said it can be difficult finding matching items in a set, like multiple of the same bath towel, for example.“Bedding and towels are items where the prices at TJ Maxx are OK, but there are so many better places to shop,” Demer said.15. Wait for the big clearance eventsYou can always find clearance items at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, but twice a year, these department stores go into a frenzy.Check out the summer and winter clearance events for some big markdowns as these retailers look to sweep away the old and bring in the new.Keep an eye out after the Fourth of July and Christmas, as there’s bound to be plenty of seasonal items that have overstayed their welcome.16. Check out other locationsRob Latour / ShutterstockThese aren’t Apple Stores. With stock this eclectic, no two TJX locations look the same.The product-testing site Reviewed recommends that you shop at locations in wealthier neighborhoods for more high-end, designer items. You’ll probably end up paying more at these stores, but you’ll have more variety to choose from.On the other hand, if you’re seeking out the cheapest steals, you might want to hunt at the stores in smaller towns.17. Peruse the pet suppliesReis World / YouTubeBefore stopping at Petco for some essentials for your fur baby, try a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls first.Several sources say you can purchase big ticket items for a fraction of the price at one of these discount stores, which offer a wide variety of items in their pet aisles.Pop culture magazine PopSugar also says you might be able to bring your dog in with you to the stores — but to call the location and check in advance first.What to read nextNot living their life to impress others’: Here are the top car brands that rich Americans earning more than $200K drive most — and why you should tooRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets insteadMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at $1.31 per share, indicating a 9.7% decline from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. The supermarket giant has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.5%, on average. WMT delivered an earnings surprise of around 10.6% in the last reported quarter.High Costs a WoeWalmart is grappling with volatility related to rising inflation. In this regard, food inflation and cost pressure associated with fuel prices, supply chain and excess inventory are a concern. Walmart’s consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 132 basis points (bps) in the last reported quarter, primarily due to markdowns and a sales mix in the U.S. segment and a LIFO charge at Sam’s Club related to inflation. The company’s operating income at constant currency fell 6% to $6.9 billion, thanks to increased wage investments and cost inflation. We believe that the persistence of these factors might have been a headwind to the quarter to be reported.Walmart Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Walmart Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseWalmart Inc. price-eps-surprise | Walmart Inc. Quote For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart expects a consolidated operating income decline of 8-10%. The company anticipates earnings per share (EPS) decline of 9-11% in the to-be-reported quarter.Favorable Sales PictureWalmart is benefiting from growing e-commerce business and omni-channel penetration. In this regard, it has been undertaking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances and improved delivery and payment systems. Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has been a major contributor to e-commerce sales.The company is innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity and building businesses such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+, Spark Delivery, Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. The company’s compelling pricing strategy has been aiding growth amid a rising inflationary environment. Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter sales at Walmart Stores U.S. is pegged at $99.6 billion compared with the $96.6 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for Walmart International and Sam’s Club currently stands at $24.5 billion and almost $21 billion, respectively, up from $23.6billion and the roughly $19 billion reported in the same quarter last year.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Walmart this time around.

TJX may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because The TJX Companies is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TJX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TJX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.63% heading into earnings season.The TJX Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The TJX Companies, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe TJX Companies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The TJX Companies, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that TJX has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for The TJX Companies, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 5.9% and 8.1%, marking their biggest weekly gains since June and March, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.2%.The week’s gains were led by the latest CPI numbers, which showed that inflation and core inflation had grown less than expected year over year in October, and headline inflation had declined from its June peak. This, and the expectation of a less hawkish Fed, tempered the buy-the-dip view.China relaxed a few of its stringent COVID-19 measures during the week, increasing optimism in the market and sending crude prices higher. However, investors remained apprehensive about a global recession in 2023 and are likely to tread carefully, keeping an eye on the direction in which the Fed will take the economy.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:McKesson, TravelCenters Rise Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of McKesson Corporation MCK have gained 4% since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on August 1.Another stock, TravelCenters of America Inc.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Story continuesCheck McKesson’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check TravelCenters of America’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Select Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Higher  Shares of Select Energy Services, Inc.

96,a2faedbc-445e-3717-bedc-0fe5cb714209,NEM,2022-11-15,11 Best Materials Dividend Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-materials-dividend-stocks-172443584.html,1668446683,STORY,"['NEM', 'SCCO', '^GSPC', 'RIO', 'XLB', 'BHP', 'VALE', 'PKX', 'IP', 'GOLD', 'DOW']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Materials Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Materials Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), and Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) represent a diverse selection of some of the best materials dividend stocks to buy now.Materials stocks cover a wide range of companies that do everything from the mining of gold, iron ore, and other precious metals, to the manufacturing of fertilizers, plastics, and other components. Materials companies, which tend to be highly cyclical in nature, have enjoyed a banner run in recent years as demand for metals, fertilizers, and plastics has grown.The iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF, which contains 39 holdings from the basic materials sector, gained 19.2% in 2019, followed by 17.8% and 25.6% gains in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Another major materials ETF is the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLB), which tracks the materials companies in the S&amp;P 500. That ETF gained 81% between 2019 and 2021 as the performance of materials companies improved across the board.Their strong performance has allowed many top materials dividend stocks to greatly boost their payouts in recent years, such as Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO), which more than doubled its dividend payments between 2020 and 2021.With a recession now looming and demand in some segments of the materials sector tapering off again, materials stocks have struggled this year, with the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund losing close to 10% of its value and the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF performing even worse.That’s created an interesting inflection point for dividend investors, as many of these companies have maintained their dividends or made only slight cuts to them in recent quarters as their earnings have fallen, but have seen their yields rise in response to falling share prices. More importantly, investor concerns about their near-term performance or the safety of their dividends may be overblown, particularly when it comes to mining stocks.Story continuesIn the middle of October, Barron’s writer Andrew Bary noted that investors appear to be avoiding mining stocks unnecessarily, given that many of the best high yield materials stocks have very strong balance sheets, are still pulling in solid earnings, and have strong dividends. Bary specifically mentioned a few of the diversified miners featured in this list, including Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) as having favorable setups.When demand rebounds and commodity prices rise again, which is expected to happen in many segments of the industry by next year, shares have the potential to rebound to 2021 levels, while dividend payments could be pushed higher than ever, ranking materials companies among the most compelling dividend stocks on the market right now.With that in mind, let’s take a look at the 11 best materials dividend stocks to buy now, many of which have greatly raised their payouts over the last two years.11 Best Materials Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Francisco Fernandes on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following materials dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.11 Best Materials Dividend Stocks To Buy Now11. POSCO (NYSE:PKX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 8 Dividend Yield: 1.36% Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) are some of the best materials dividend stocks to buy now. Another materials company worth looking into is Korean steelmaker POSCO (NYSE:PKX), which pays out a variable dividend quarterly.POSCO (NYSE:PKX)’s trailing 12-month dividend payouts have more than doubled since the end of 2020 despite the company skipping a quarterly payment in Q1 of this year, during which it split off its steel operations and transitioned into a holding company. POSCO pays out 30% of its net income as dividends to shareholders, which amounted to $0.7976 and $0.7382 payments during Q2 and Q3 respectively. The company’s Q3 operating profit did slump by 71% year-over-year as global steel demand weakens.Hedge fund ownership of POSCO (NYSE:PKX) has fallen by 41% in 2022 among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, hitting an all-time low in the process. Furthermore, the company’s largest shareholder as of June 30, Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management, unloaded 92% of its PKX stake in Q3, leaving it with 84,898 shares.10. Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Dividend Yield: 3.31% Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s dividend payments more than doubled in 2021 to $3.20 from $1.50 a year earlier, and got off to a strong start in the first half of this year, with two quarterly payouts totaling $2.25. The company has since pared back its payments to $1.25 in the second half of this year, including a $0.50 quarterly payment later this month, its lowest since 2020.Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s EPS has fallen by about 20% year-over-year during each of the past two quarters as demand weakens and copper prices decline. Nonetheless, its $0.67 in Q3 EPS handily beat estimates, and analysts tend to prefer Southern Copper over its bigger rival Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) thanks to its lower cost of production and ability to return more cash to shareholders.Hedge fund ownership of Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) ticked up slightly during Q2 but has nonetheless fallen by 38% since the first quarter of 2021. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns a sizable SCCO stake as of June 30 consisting of 3.58 million shares, while Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group added Southern Copper to its 13F portfolio during Q2, buying 422,183 shares.9. BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 19 Dividend Yield: 11.2% Global resources giant BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), which primarily mines copper, coal, and iron ore, has grown its dividend payments over each of the last two years after scaling back its payouts in 2020. Its semi-annual payments totaled $6.50 in 2022, which equates to a dividend yield of over 11%. The dividend is unlikely to remain that high for long, with the yield likely settling around the 5-6% mark in the future.As with other mining companies, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) has been impacted by weakening prices and demand, particularly when it comes to the company’s robust iron ore operations, which accounted for over 50% of the company’s record fiscal year 2022 EBITDA. How the Chinese economy performs in the coming quarters will be key to the company’s fortunes, as the country typically accounts for 60% or more of BHP’s revenue.Smart money interest in BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) has remained relatively consistent over the past decade, with between 16 and 21 hedge funds being long BHP throughout the majority of that period. As with Southern Copper, Ken Fisher’s firm was the largest shareholder of BHP on June 30, while Ken Griffin’s was also buying BHP shares during Q2, raising its stake by 78% to 1.34 million.8. Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Dividend Yield: 10.6% Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)’s dividend payments totaled $7.46 in 2020, down from over $9.50 in 2021, but well above the $3.86 paid out in 2020. Its dividend payments have grown at a CAGR of 23.7% over the last five years.A diversified global mining company, Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) gives investors exposure to a wide range of minerals, metals, and gems like diamonds, aluminum, lithium, gold, and copper. Rio Tinto’s financial results fell across the board during the June quarter, with revenue declining by 10% year-over-year to $14.9 billion, while diluted EPS took a 27.8% hit to $2.73. In a research note to investors, Jefferies stated that the company’s earnings and cash flow were likely to continue trending down in Q3 before potentially hitting a trough in Q4.Hedge fund ownership of Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) rose for three straight quarters beginning in Q3 2021 before dipping slightly during Q2 of this year. Quant funds Arrowstreet Capital and Renaissance Technologies held two of the largest RIO positions as of June 30, owning 10 million and 1.35 million shares respectively.7. International Paper Company (NYSE:IP)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27 Dividend Yield: 5.05% International Paper Company (NYSE:IP) cut its quarterly dividend payments by $0.05 in the final quarter of 2021, to $0.4625 per share, a payout rate that has remained in place throughout 2022. The company has a 32-year run of making dividend payments and has a stable dividend payout ratio of less than 50% supporting its payments.International Paper Company (NYSE:IP) shares hit a 52-week low in early October, which has contributed to the packaging company’s dividend yield soaring above 5%. IP shares took a big in September in part due to a poor earnings report and forecast from FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which frightened investors away from e-commerce packaging-related companies like International Paper, which generates more than half its revenue from the sale of corrugated packaging.There was a 29% drop in the number of funds long International Paper Company (NYSE:IP) during the first quarter of this year, dropping smart money ownership of the stock to a two-year low. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates had 4.5% 13F exposure to IP as of June 30, owning 4.99 million shares worth $209 million.6. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27 Dividend Yield: 9.14% Brazilian miner Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) had raised its dividend in 2020 and 2021, but was forced to scale it back this year as profits decline. The company’s two semi-annual payments this year totaled $1.4115, down from over $2.50 last year. While investors appear concerned about the future of Vale’s dividend, driving VALE shares down by 25.8% since April 1 (and ironically, making the stock’s yield even more attractive), the company remains committed to paying out a healthy dividend even as it faces headwinds in its iron ore business.Hedge fund ownership of Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) has remained virtually flat for four straight quarters, but remains down by 35% since early 2017. Arrowstreet Capital made a big investment in the company during Q2, raising its stake by 960% to 20.1 million shares, while Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners hiked its own position in the company by 22% to 19.1 million shares.GMO LLC is thrilled with the amount of money Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) is returning to shareholders, as revealed in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at Vale (NYSE:VALE), the world’s largest iron ore producer, as a case study for how shareholders can be rewarded. Vale’s stock price is about where it was at the beginning of last year. Despite the market’s lack of enthusiasm, the company generated about $20 billion of free cash flow last year. Not bad for a company with a market cap of a little over $100 billion and no substantive debt as of the end of March. 4 What did the company do with all that cash? Last year, Vale paid out about $9 billion in regularly scheduled dividends and distributed another $10 billion between extra dividends and share repurchases. Combined with dividends distributed in the first quarter of this year and a recently announced share repurchase, Vale has returned or announced the return of over $33 billion since the beginning of last year, almost a 32% yield relative to the market cap of the company. Not a bad way to win.”Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) are some of the best materials dividend stocks to buy now.

The company is projecting a U.S. comparable store sales decline of 3-5% in the to-be-reported quarter. It reported 16% U.S. open-only comp store sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

M, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Macy's is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for M in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 22 cents per share for M, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for M, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +18.92% heading into earnings season.Macy's, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMacy's, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMacy's, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Macy's, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that M has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The company is likely to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter bottom line is pegged at 1 cent per share, suggesting a sharp decline of 96.3% from 27 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.8 billion, indicating a 3.6% decline from that reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, Gap’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 300%. The company has reported an earnings surprise of 10.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteGap’s fiscal third-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of the changing consumer preference from casual wear to dressier clothes, as well as higher inventory, a tough macroeconomic environment and elevated costs. The company has been witnessing industry-wide challenges and headwinds in its Old Navy brand, including issues related to the launch of BODEQUALITY. Also, lower-than-anticipated demand in key categories like active, fleece, and kids and baby are likely to have dented the fiscal third-quarter performance.The company has been witnessing higher air freight costs. Huge discounts at Old Navy and rising commodity price increases are expected to have acted as other deterrents. Also, high inventory levels due to longer transit times, more delays, pack-and-hold strategies, and elevated AUC and input costs have been headwinds.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management noted that the company entered the fiscal third quarter with higher inventory. This is likely to have weighed on the fiscal third-quarter performance.However, management remained optimistic about sales in the second half of fiscal 2022. It anticipated air freight costs to decline in the second half of fiscal 2022, suggesting improved costs for the fiscal third quarter. The bottom line in the fiscal third quarter is expected to have gained from the sale of its UK distribution center.Gap has long been gaining from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. Strength in women’s active and wellness category, along with an increased focus on performance active as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.Strength in Banana Republic has also been a key driver in recent quarters. The company’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from the easing of fuel prices, which is likely to have led to higher discretionary spending.Gap has been on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, focusing on store fleet optimization. The company’s efforts to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations, are likely to have aided sales in the fiscal third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gap this season.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are three of the biggest companies in the world that have all hit 52-week lows this month.With a recession looming and a bear market having taken hold this year, it’s not surprising that many stocks are hovering around 52-week lows. It is rare to see so many high quality stocks get beaten down to the degree they have in recent months however. The four most popular stocks among hedge funds have all touched 52-week lows since November 3, creating a great opportunity for investors to buy low on some of the most respected companies in the world.Scanning the market for stocks at 52-week lows is a time-honored tradition among value investors, who covet the opportunity to buy quality companies with long track records of success at discounted prices. In many cases, such companies are merely caught in cyclical lows, without any real change to their long-term fundamental outlook that justifies their shares trading at their lowest point in a year or more.There are several technical reasons why stocks at 52-week lows can make good short-term buys as well. As stocks reach new yearly lows, short sellers are more likely to have profited from their positions and will look to buy shares to cover them. Bargain hunters, like the aforementioned value investors, are also more likely to start buying shares when they cross the 52-week low threshold, which can provide them with an immediate, though potentially short-lived, boost.That doesn’t mean every stock at a 52-week low is necessarily poised for a rebound however, either in the short or long term, which is evidenced by multiple stocks on this list, which have fallen to 2+ year lows. If you had bought these stocks earlier this year expecting a rebound by this point, you’d be sorely disappointed, as they’ve continued to trend down amid the tough economic backdrop.Story continuesAs with any investment decision, investors need to ask themselves why these stocks are at 52-week lows and whether their long-term outlook has changed enough in the last year to justify those new lows. If that doesn’t appear to be the case, it could be that the stock was simply overvalued a year ago and has fallen back to a more realistic valuation, which has happened to quite a number of growth stocks this year.We’ll try to answer some of those burning questions in this article as we take a look at 10 of the best 52-Week Low Stocks to buy now.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following 52-week low stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

(NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are several stocks worth buying now that have all hit 52-week lows within the last week. Another is medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), whose shares touched a 52-week low on November 4, a week after the release of the company’s Q3 results.Edwards Lifesciences shares fell by 17.9% on October 28 after the company announced Q3 sales of $1.32 billion and pro forma EPS of $0.61, both of which represented slight misses compared to consensus estimates. Sales grew just 1% year-over-year during the quarter, but 7% on a constant currency basis. The company’s Q4 pro forma EPS guidance of between $2.40 and $2.50 also fell below estimates, as well as the company’s earlier guidance. Despite the sell off and EW shares hitting a 52-week low, they still trade at 31.2x earnings, which is rich given the tepid Q3 growth, but the company looks to have a compelling long-term growth runway ahead of it.Hedge fund ownership of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) dipped by 13% during Q2 after ticking up for two straight quarters. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in EW as of June 30 among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 7.33 million shares worth $697 million.Wedgewood Partners believes that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW)’s growth should accelerate in the years to come, as discussed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) reported just +5% growth in revenue (foreign exchange adjusted) compared to a year ago. While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global healthcare systems emerging from pandemic disruptions. The Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system, PASCAL, and also presented compelling related clinical data, which should help support accelerating growth over the next few years. As for Edwards’ core TAVR system, there continues to be a (unfortunately) pent-up, untreated population suffering from severe aortic stenosis that will finally be able to find their way back into healthcare systems as labor market pressures ease.”9. Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 1-Year Share Price Decline: 18% Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) shares hit a 52-week low on November 3 following the release of its Q3 results and underwhelming billings guidance for Q4. The cybersecurity company’s Q3 results were pretty good, as sales rose by 33% year-over-year to $1.15 billion, slightly topping estimates, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 65% from a year earlier to $0.33 and easily beat consensus.Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT)’s Q4 billings guidance left something to be desired with investors however, coming up short of the $1.74 billion consensus estimate, even at the top end of the company’s range. Management cited the uncertain macro-economic environment when drawing up its guidance, which may have caused additional near-term investor concerns. Longer-term, Fortinet looks like a strong bet to continue growing at a steady pace in the burgeoning cybersecurity space, which makes its recent weakness a good buying opportunity.Hedge funds sold off Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) in droves shortly into the pandemic, with the stock hitting a 7-year low in smart money ownership at the end of Q1 2021. There’s been an 83% surge in the number of funds long FTNT since then, including a 13% rise in Q2 2022. The company’s biggest bulls were all loading up on shares in Q2, as seven of the eight funds with the largest Fortinet holdings as of June 30 increased the size of their stakes by at least 360% during the quarter.8. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 46 1-Year Share Price Decline: 34.2% The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shares hit a 52-week (and 2-year) low on November 2, but have since rebounded by 20% in the last week. The cosmetic company’s sales fell by 11% year-over-year during its Q1 of fiscal year 2023, sliding to $3.93 billion, while organic net sales dipped by 5%. Adjusted earnings tumbled by 28% year-over-year to $1.37 per diluted share.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) anticipates a rough fiscal Q2 due to various headwinds, including the strong U.S. dollar and tighter inventory management among retailers. The company projects diluted earnings will fall by as much as 54% year-over-year during the quarter. Management expects those headwinds to begin abating in the second half of its fiscal 2023 however, with a return to strong organic sales and adjusted EPS growth.Hedge fund ownership of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL) shot up during the first quarter of 2021, but has fallen by 24% since then. It has ticked up slightly this year as shares have fallen however, as hedge funds appear to like EL’s upside potential at the current depressed prices. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP owns 5.95 million EL shares as of June 30, with 6.68% 13F exposure to the stock. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates cut its stake in the company by 16% during Q2 to own 612,560 shares at the end of the quarter.7. Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 1-Year Share Price Decline: 20.7% Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) shares tumbled to a 3-year low on November 3 despite the company soundly beating revenue estimates with its third quarter results. The fintech company grew revenue by 3.8% year-over-year during Q3 to $2.29 billion, beating estimates by $250 million. Adjusted EPS rose $0.30 year-over-year to $2.48, which matched estimates. On a constant currency basis, Global Payments expects to grow revenue by 10% to 11% this year.The 3-year low for GPN shares was spite of the company finding a buyer for its Netspend consumer business earlier this year, which netted the company $1 billion in cash and will allow it to focus on its primary B2B operations.Hedge fund ownership of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) peaked at the end of Q3 2021, but has fallen for the past three straight quarters as shares have started to tumble. There’s been a 16% decline in the number of funds long GPN during that period. Larry Robbins’ healthcare-focused Glenview Capital Management is a firm bull on GPN, owning 2.35 million shares on June 30, with the stock ranking as the fund’s top non-healthcare pick.Manole Capital Management has been a long time bull of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) and had this to say about the company in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Over the next week or so, we will be publishing a stock-specific note on payment processor Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN). We have owned GPN for nearly two decades and it currently is one of our largest positions. We will begin by highlighting recent spending trends, eCommerce developments and how many of our payment companies can actually benefit from inflation and higher costs. We will discuss their business, industry trends, what is driving their growth, and then highlight their compelling valuation.”6. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 62 1-Year Share Price Decline: 31.5% Closing out the first half of the list is Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), whose shares hit a 2-year low on November 4. The animal healthcare giant slashed its 2022 sales guidance by between $150 million and $225 million on November 3, in addition to cutting its earnings projections, which triggered a flight from the stock. The company cited several headwinds as being contributors to the weaker projections, including unfavorable currency exchange rates, supply chain obstacles, and staffing challenges at veterinarian offices. The company otherwise remains bullish on its long-term outlook and growth catalysts thanks to its pipeline and global scale, predicting market-beating sales growth in the years to come.Hedge fund ownership of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) hit an all-time high at the end of Q1 even as shares started tumbling, though there was a slight pullback in Q2. Barry Dargan’s Intermede Investment Partners and Nicolai Tangen’s Ako Capital each owned more than 1 million ZTS shares on September 30 and had 4.39% and 3% 13F exposure to the stock respectively.The Baron Health Care Fund talked about some of the recent developments at Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Zoetis Inc., the global leader in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of companion and farm animal health medicine and vaccines, fell along with shares of other high-multiple 2021 standout performers. We retain conviction as Zoetis recently reported a top and bottom line beat with more than 21% growth driven by dermatology, parasiticides, and recently launched monoclonal osteoarthritic treatments. The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”Amazon.com, Inc.

This summer, Rose and approximately 30 other interns from the NRG MBA and Centralized Summer Internship programs worked hard, honing their skills to prepare for the next step in their careers.Internship programs at NRG are designed for graduate and undergraduate students with a genuine interest in the energy industry, business, and/or sustainability. The goal for our internships is to provide organization-wide exposure to the business and a clear understanding for how we operate in the marketplace. They provide an opportunity for students to develop individual skillsets, learn from purposeful mentorships, and network throughout the company with hands-on projects.This year's program kicked off in June with two days of in-person onboarding, team building, and leadership presentations at our headquarters in Houston. From there, interns enjoyed a hybrid work environment from either the Houston, Pittsburgh, or Princeton office.Aside from various in-office activities, our 2022 class had the chance to tour a local power plant and pack lunches for school-age children during a volunteer opportunity with Kids' Meals. Of course these experiences were just the tip of the iceberg for this year's group.Here's a closer look at what our interns had to say about their summer with NRG.What interested you about being an NRG intern?I was interested in working in the energy industry, so I sought out several energy companies at our recruiting event. NRG stood out to me because their recruiters seemed interested in being there, and they were enthusiastic about the company. Also, an operations manager joined in the recruiting event, and they were able to speak to the specific job responsibilities.Story continuesStephen Walior - Asset Porfolio Intern - University of Texas ‘23It offered me an opportunity to gain experience in the field that I want to pursue after college, while also being in a very interesting industry. It was also enticing because NRG is a very well known and successful company with [thousands of] employees.Zane Carlson - Business Sales East Intern - Gettysburg College '24What were some of your key responsibilities and projects?My main responsibility was to set up and price RFPs (request for proposals) for brokers. From there, I added various margins, submitted our price to the brokers, and hopefully won the contract. I also helped sales support, fixing errors in different aggregations in Salesforce.Zane Carlson - Business Sales East Intern - Gettysburg College '24I assisted the team in a number of departments like marketing, innovation, and business model. There, I was able to conduct market research and gather survey insights for the teams.Juliana Gianni - Sustainability and Advisory Services, EV Services Intern - Dickinson College ‘24How did your understanding of NRG and the energy industry change during your time here?I learned that NRG's core values are truly present in everything we do, not just a promise made in external communications.Merrick Fowlks - Talent Intern - UH Clear Lake '23As an MBA intern, I completed site visits to the Smart Home and T.H. Wharton power plant. These visits allowed me to interact with folks on other teams. Working alongside the other MBA interns and the full-time rotational associate team also helped me learn more about their teams and the projects they were working on.Katie Cowan - MBA Intern, Customer Experience - UT Austin ‘23What was your favorite experience this summer at NRG?Touring the operating power plant. I was able to see, in-person, how everything works and the challenges the plants deal with. This gave me a lot of perspective for when you are dispatching those assets on the desk.Stephen Walior - Asset Porfolio Intern - University of Texas ‘23I really enjoyed the HBCU Scholarship event. I got to meet [President and CEO] Mauricio [Gutierrez], the scholarship winners, and fellow colleagues who celebrate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I).Merrick Fowlks - Talent Intern - UH Clear Lake '23Did you learn about any career opportunities that you didn't know previously existed?I learned about the go-to-market team and how I can work with other departments to come up with new strategies and expand on product ideas for them to hit the market.Macy Pham - Go-To-Market Intern, Green Mountain Energy - University of Houston ‘24Before joining the internal audit team, I knew very little about the day-to-day life of somebody working in this field. During my internship, I learned about many opportunities through the finance department and beyond.Mason Gonzales - Internal Audit Intern - University of Houston ‘24Did your internship experience give you a sense of inclusion at NRG?Yes, I immediately felt integrated, like I was an important asset to my team. The whole summer I was treated as a member of a team rather than an intern. I was given an equal opportunity to voice my opinion, propose ideas, and contribute to projects, just like any full-time employee.Katie Cowan - MBA Intern, Customer Experience - UT Austin ‘23Yes, everyone on the team was kind and wanted to share their knowledge with me.Rumi Mordi - Intern, DE&amp;C - University of Houston ‘23What surprised you most about your internship experience?I was most surprised about the opportunities to interact with high-level people on a regular basis. I was not expecting to have the chance to hear them speak, network with them, and present to them.Juliana Gianni - Sustainability and Advisory Services, EV Services Intern - Dickinson College ‘24The network I was able to build and the support I was given from leadership. I was able to meet over 25 new people in the 10-week program.Katie Cowan - MBA Intern, Customer Experience - UT Austin ‘23There are so many different departments within NRG, and they all have a hand in the success of the company.Mason Gonzales - Internal Audit Intern - University of Houston ‘24What advice would you want to pass on to future interns?Ask questions! Employees at Green Mountain Energy and NRG are so kind and will definitely answer them. Also, don't be afraid to propose a new perspective or idea to the team. That's what interns are for. We provide a fresh look to people who have been working on things for years, so be confident in your ideas and insights.Macy Pham - Go-To-Market Intern, Green Mountain Energy - University of Houston ‘24The best advice I can pass on is to seek discomfort within your role. Go out of your comfort zone and create an even more valuable experience for yourself. I wish I had been more active in meeting new people. Also, if you are ever feeling bored or not challenged, talk to your managers until they have to give you something to do that will show you go above and beyond.Mason Gonzales - Internal Audit Intern - University of Houston ‘24Following another successful season of internships, it's time to officially start planning for our 2023 class!

108,975ffad9-d5f0-3d3d-a623-7c93574a9057,NEE,2022-11-15,"10,000% Gains - The Startup That Raised From Retail, Then Got an Investment From Bill Gates and IPO'd at Massive Gains",Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-000-gains-startup-raised-154635982.html,1668440795,STORY,['NEE-PR'],"[In a surprise paradigm shift, retail investors are landing some of the best terms in the hottest startups. Gone are the days of billionaires and hedge funds getting exclusive access to the hottest startups. Heliogen Inc. (NYSE: HLGN) is a company that got a slew of press for receiving an investment from the 20-year-long world’s richest man Bill Gates, then going to IPO in early 2022. However, most people don’t know that Heliogen’s earliest backers were actually retail investors. That’s right, the company’s earliest backers were nearly 1,000 everyday investors like you, who cumulatively invested over $1.6 million to help fund the company.Heliogen launched its seed round (one of a startup’s earliest investment rounds) on SeedInvest, a leading equity crowdfunding platform at a mere $20 million valuation in 2017. In early 2021, the company IPO’d via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) at a valuation of about $2 billion and a share price of $10. Notwithstanding dilution, that’s an effective share price of just ten cents. That means anyone who got in on their earliest round could have been sitting on gains of as much as 100x. An investment of $500 would have earned you about $50,000 after only five years.The company’s stock has since retreated significantly from its IPO high of $15 to roughly $1 per share price. This is likely from the poor timing of the IPO and general macroeconomic conditions. However, Heliogen is competing against several traditional utility companies like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE), so they definitely have their work cut out for them. NextEra Energy Inc. reported $6.72 Billion in revenue last quarter and a net income of $1.7 Billion. These highly profitable, multi-billion dollar companies like NextEra Energy likely won’t give up market share lying down, which could spell further disaster for Heliogen. Heliogen is consistently losing tens of millions per quarter, so the decline in price could simply be a lack of faith in the business model or its ability to compete.Story continuesDespite retreating to just $1 per share, the market cap is still at approximately $200 million, or as much as 10x gains from its seed round. So while anyone buying into their IPO isn’t so lucky, many of Heliogens earliest investors on SeedInvest are still sitting on massive gains if they are still holding.How Can You Get Involved And Invest In Startups?Heliogen isn’t the only company with a story like this. Atlis Motors, Knightscope, and a host of others are all companies that raised at the earliest stages from everyday investors, then IPO’d, resulting in massive gains for those investors. However, hundreds of these companies are raising every day on top platforms like StartEngine, Wefunder, and Republic.TruBrain, for example, is an innovative startup focusing on wearable technology for cognitive function. Its device recently received FDA qualification, and it has currently raised over $1 million on StartEngine.Gameflip is a leading gaming marketplace startup that has facilitated over $140 million in sales and is used by over $6 million gamers worldwide. Despite this, the company is raising on StartEngine at a share price of only 50 cents and a valuation of $34 million.It’s as simple as going to any leading equity crowdfunding platform, looking over the hundreds of startups raising funds on their site, then clicking invest. After that, you wait and get occasional updates about the company. While not every startup will succeed, many investors use the 90-10 or 80-20 rule. Only 10% to 20% of startup investments will make it to an exit like an IPO, but that 10% to 20% have the potential to make up all the gains for the others that fail.Image courtesy of SeedInvestDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The company reported robust revenue growth for first-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. The trend is expected to continue. However, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 0.9% compared with a 15.6% fall of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 17.5% decline.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.82 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to continue their strong growth for the next five years at an annual rate of 8%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 9.25%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during first-quarter fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment (launched in fiscal 2019).Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are expected to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Per a report by Verified Market Research, the dental equipment market was valued at $7.41 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $10.25 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 4.8%. Although sales at this segment were down 8.1% year over year during first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Story continuesSolid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management at Patterson Companies expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. Both the company’s companion animal and production animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. In fact, the company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well-poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. On the first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call, the company stated that it had monetized a portion of its investment in Vetsource during this period, thereby leading to an investment gain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 5.7%, owing to sustained strength in the production animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.DownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition not only from other national and full-service firms but also from at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level besides hundreds of small local distributors. Patterson Companies needs to consistently introduce products to withstand competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a stable estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings in fiscal 2023 remained at $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.69 billion, suggesting a 2.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Patterson Companies, Inc.

While 38% of respondents with European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) Refit requirements are confident they'll be ready or have made significant progress on the program expected to go live in the first half of 2024, more than half of respondents with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rewrite reporting requirements are not ready for December's implementation date.""The survey results indicate that more than a year ahead of implementation, those firms with EMIR Refit reporting requirements are taking a proactive approach to regulatory readiness,"" said Igor Kaplun, Head of Cappitech Business Development, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""As with any large-scale regulatory change, it pays to prepare early to stay ahead of the next wave of changes on the horizon.""Conducted by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Cappitech, the survey found that 99% of respondents indicate having reporting obligations in at least two jurisdictions. As this trend continues, the industry is taking a more proactive approach to existing and new regulations, with more than half making changes in 2022 to enhance existing processes or prepare for new regulations, almost double the 26% who made changes in 2021.""The industry has matured significantly over the past decade and there is a realization that reporting requirements will continue to change and evolve, and firms need to plan ahead, not only for new regulations, but in terms of how best to benefit from improved technology and global solutions,"" said Ronen Kertis, Head of Cappitech, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""In some regions, we are starting to see a genuine shift in the way in which firms consider and plan for their regulatory reporting requirements, while there are other regions where work still needs to be done.""Story continuesKey highlights from the report include:The use of a combination of in-house and vendor reporting continues to grow, particularly among Tier 1 firms: 64% of respondents are using a hybrid approach today, with 68% of those being Tier 1 organizations; this is up from 57% overall, over half of which were Tier 1 in 2021.The most common change to regulatory reporting is increased automation, used to prevent and manage inefficiencies and inaccuracies as a key driver.Managed services for regulatory reporting is expected to grow over the next few years, with 60% identifying it as a tool being considered in their future plans.The EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is still in its early phases, but sourcing data is very clearly the most notable challenge – highlighted by 55% of those in scope.Number of regimes required to reportThe Global Regulatory Reporting Survey data was collected during August and September 2022 from 89 respondents, of which 51% worked for banks, 18% asset managers and 9% brokers. 31% were from Global Tier 1 organizations.

They are also assessing how much demand may fall as they raise prices for consumers.The maker of Ball Park hotdogs projected full-year 2023 sales between $55 billion and $57 billion, compared with analysts' expectation for $53.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its revenue outlook was ""surprisingly strong,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.Consumers are willing to pay for food to eat at home, Tyson Chief Executive Donnie King told reporters.But analysts have raised concerns that higher prices will increasingly push shoppers to buy cheaper meat, denting processors' profits. Demand for premium cuts of beef declined in the quarter ended Oct. 1 compared with strong results a year earlier, Tyson said.Quarterly operating income for Tyson's beef business, its largest segment, sank by 67% from a year ago to $375 million, while its average prices dropped by 8.2%. Tyson paid more for cattle, the company said, as a drought in western United States has pushed ranchers to reduce their herds.""Beef margins are correcting rapidly amidst a declining cattle herd,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said.In pork, Tyson reported an operating loss of $55 million, compared with income of $78 million last year, as sales volumes and prices slipped. The company's chicken business swung to a quarterly profit, meanwhile, as sales volumes increased 1.1% and prices climbed by an average 18.2%.Next year, ""chicken prices likely will be down by a great degree and consumers will continue to trade down,"" JP Morgan said.Tyson reported quarterly sales rose about 7% to $13.74 billion, topping analysts' estimates for $13.50 billion. The company posted an operating margin of 5.6%, compared with 14.9% last year. Excluding items, earnings were $1.63 per share, below estimates for $1.73.

If you want to see more of the biggest ESG companies in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest ESG Companies in the World.As the rapid growth of electric vehicles shows, consumers are increasingly interested in environmental sustainability. Although it might cost a little bit more, it is worth it to many consumers if it helps save the environment and fight against climate change.Over the years, investors have also become more interested in sustainability rather than putting just profits first. For ESG investors, it's worth not making as much in profits if it helps make the world more sustainable.Although ESG actually originated in the 1960's as socially responsible investing, ESG investing has grown substantially more in recent decades. One reason is that global warming has become a much bigger problem now than it was in the 1960's. Another reason is that ESG activists can make a much bigger difference given the internet in their calls for more income equality or better corporate governance. With the internet, a lot more people also realize that our world isn't sustainable in its current path unless we help improve it.ESGESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. In ESG investing, investors assess how well a company does in terms of environmental issues such as reducing their carbon emissions, social issues such how companies help their communities, and governance issues such as management diversity.In ESG investing, an investor might choose to invest in a company that does well in ESG issues but has a slightly higher valuation than a company with similar qualities but doesn't do as well in ESG.Given changing consumer behavior, ESG investing can also add value too. McKinsey explains,Although there can be wide discrepancies in practice, including customers who refuse to pay even 1 percent more, we’ve found that upward of 70 percent of consumers surveyed on purchases in multiple industries, including the automotive, building, electronics, and packaging categories, said they would pay an additional 5 percent for a green product if it met the same performance standards as a nongreen alternative. In another study, nearly half (44 percent) of the companies we surveyed identified business and growth opportunities as the impetus for starting their sustainability programs. The payoffs are real. When Unilever developed Sunlight, a brand of dishwashing liquid that used much less water than its other brands, sales of Sunlight and Unilever’s other water-saving products proceeded to outpace category growth by more than 20 percent in a number of water-scarce markets. And Finland’s Neste, founded as a traditional petroleum-refining company more than 70 years ago, now generates more than two-thirds of its profits from renewable fuels and sustainability-related products.Story continues2022Although many ESG companies have growth potential, 2022 has been a tough year for the market. To fight inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone and many analysts think the central bank could continue to raise it further.While October's inflation was lower than expected and the market has rallied recently, there is still uncertainty and potential downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.5 Most Diverse Countries in the WorldMethodologyFor our list of 15 Biggest ESG Companies in the World, we took the 15 largest stocks from Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) in terms of % of the fund and we reranked them based on their market capitalization as of November 12.

Don't Ignore These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-140002792.html,1668434402,STORY,"['EXPE', 'GME']","[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. GameStop (GME) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on December 14, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.23 a share.GameStop's Earnings ESP sits at 20.69%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.29.GME is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Expedia (EXPE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Expedia is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 9, 2023. EXPE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.89 a share 87 days from its next earnings release.Expedia's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.22% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, GME and EXPE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Apart from food and energy, core CPI is forecasted to have climbed by 0.5%, or 6.5% on an annual basis. This is less than the 0.6% jump in September, which represented an annual pace of 6.6%. The central bank has hinted that the future rate hikes will be smaller, although interest rates will continue to climb to rein in inflation.A slower-than-expected rate of inflation sparked a rally in bond prices, which trims their yield. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4% to 3.86% on November 10. This also indicates some relief in mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate exceeded the 7% mark, touching 7.08% for the week ended November 10, as per Freddie Mac. The real estate sector on November 10 gained 6.7%, becoming the best-performing S&amp;P 500 segment. Firms like D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) were the most prominent beneficiaries of the real estate rally. Our Methodology We selected the following construction stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility.

CRH plc (NYSE:CRH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is an Ireland-based company that manufactures and distributes building materials. It operates through three segments – Americas Materials, Europe Materials, and Building Products. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) commenced its share repurchase program in May 2018, and as of September 2022 it has returned $3.8 billion to shareholders under its ongoing share buyback plan. Story continuesOn September 13, JPMorgan analyst Elodie Rall maintained an Overweight rating on CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) but lowered the price target on the shares to EUR 50 from EUR 59. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 12 hedge funds were bullish on CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the leading position holder in the company, with 752,445 shares worth $26.20 million. Like D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL), CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is one of the best construction stocks to monitor. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) was outlined in detail in our December 2021 Quarterly Report. Since then, the tragic war in Ukraine commenced with no signs of resolution. This war and associated sanctions on Russia have led to major disruptions to European energy markets. CRH is a relatively energy intensive business and around 20% of the Group’s operations are in Europe. We expect they will be negatively impacted by higher energy prices and reduced economic activity. Around 75% of CRH’s operations are in North America and will be less impacted compared to the European operations.We have followed and analyzed the global building products industry for nearly 25 years and the current share price of CRH presents an investment opportunity that rarely arises. CRH recently sold a business for US$3.8 billion, equating to almost 15x EBIT. In comparison, the remainder of CRH which consists of many businesses which are higher quality than the divested operation, is trading on around 9x EBIT, 11x PE, 9% free cash flow, 4% dividend yield and CRH is buying back around 3% of its shares annually. CRH has delivered shareholders a 15% return per annum, compounded over 50 years. The current share price provides compelling value for investors with a longer-term horizon.”11. Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) is a Colorado-based company that manufactures and sells construction materials and downstream products for the public infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets.

It is one of the best construction stocks to invest in. Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari on November 8 raised the price target on Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) to $33 from $29 and reiterated a Buy recommendation on the shares following the in-line Q3 results.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, Summit Materials, Inc.

Fears of a potential economic slowdown and a corresponding cooling in construction activity weighed on the company’s shares in the quarter. However, Summit has made noteworthy strides in optimizing its business portfolio through the divestiture of underperforming assets, allowing it to drive margins higher through efficiency gains and accretive acquisitions. Summit also is the beneficiary of ongoing migration trends favoring construction activity in the exurban and rural markets it primarily serves.”10. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is a Georgia-based homebuilding company that acquires and develops land for residential purposes. PulteGroup, Inc.

(NYSE:PHM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $50 from $52. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)’s Q3 earnings miss was caused by weak homebuilding revenue and a larger than forecasted unit order decline, the analyst told investors. 2023 will be a ""trough year"" for housing demand, but the analyst still expects a 21% return on equity for PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Harris Associates is the biggest position holder in PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) as of Q2 2022, with 4.8 million shares worth $191.6 million. Here is what Miller Value Partners specifically said about PulteGroup, Inc.

(NYSE:PHM), traded down to half their financial crisis lows despite reporting housing improvements for the first time. Fear ruled in the short term, but fundamentals ultimately prevailed. Homebuilders were top performers in 2012 posting triple-digit increases in some cases. Opportunity Equity was a top performer that year.”9. Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO) is an Arizona-based company that designs, constructs, and sells manufactured homes in the United States.

Richard Scott Greeder’s Broad Bay Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 268,000 shares worth $52.5 million. 8. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) is a Texas-based company that produces and supplies heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States.

(NYSE:EXP) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $136 from $146.

(NYSE:EXP) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 183,884 shares worth $20.2 million. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The investment thesis for Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) was featured in our December 2020 Quarterly Report. Since then, the business has met our expectations. Eagle Materials is a low-cost regional producer of cement and wallboard. The U.S. cement industry is sold out, with imports required to meet demand levels. Eagle Materials operates in the centre of the U.S. where imports from the coast are prohibitively expensive. These sold-out conditions are before an expected increase in demand in 2023 and beyond as the U.S. implements its US$1 trillion infrastructure spending program.Eagle Materials’ wallboard operations also have a cost advantage over its competitors, predominantly using natural gypsum located next to its manufacturing facilities, rather than relying on more expensive synthetic gypsum derived from the waste generated by coal power plants or imported natural gypsum.Both the cement and gypsum industry have increased prices to offset cost inflation (see Figure 11). Eagle Materials has benefitted from these price increases and expanded margins due to its low-cost position in the industry. While we expect some softening in the wallboard industry due to reduced new residential construction, we consider Eagle Materials is currently materially undervalued, trading on 11x EV/EBIT, 12x PE and a 10% free cash flow yield.”7. M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) was founded in 1976 and is based in Columbus, Ohio.

Shareholders' equity reached a record high of $1.9 billion, a 25% increase from a year ago, with book value per share of $71. The return on equity came in at 27%. M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) is one of the premier construction stocks to buy now. Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless on October 27 reiterated an Outperform rating on M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $63 from $83 following the Q3 results. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 23 hedge funds were long M/I Homes, Inc.

(PHM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-trending-stock-140002889.html,1668434402,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +18.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 13% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.91 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -24.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.15 points to a change of +39% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.09 indicates a change of -30.2% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -27%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and -7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These companies endured periods of economic downturn better than their peers due to consistent cash flows and stable earnings. In times of financial volatility, investors focus on stocks that offer low risk with proven track records of dividend growth. Stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground in this context.Over the years, dividend growers have taken a significant place in investors’ portfolios. These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans. In an extended period of higher inflation, like the one we are confronted with today, dividend growth stocks provide a hedge against rising costs with stable income. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers reported an average annual return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return for non-dividend payers. During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%. This shows that dividend growth stocks offer an excellent way to generate passive income during inflationary periods.Dividend stocks have remained a significant component of total market returns in the past. In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks represented 8% of the total return in the first two years of this decade.Stephanie Link, a chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, spoke about dividend investments in her recent interview with Barron’s. She asserted that investors should focus on growing payouts instead of high dividends as dividend growth is of utmost importance in an inflationary environment. This report also highlighted that dividend shares in the S&amp;P 500 index reported an 11% decline this year as of October 29, compared with a 23% drop for non-dividend stocks.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

An infusion set is tubing that delivers insulin from an insulin pump to the body and typically requires a set change every two to three days.The Medtronic Extended infusion set uses advanced materials that help reduce insulin preservative loss and maintain insulin flow and stability to double the wear time of an infusion set. The innovative design of the Medtronic Extended infusion set leverages proprietary technology, including a new tubing connector that improves physical and chemical stability of insulin, the reliability of infusion site performance, and reduces the risk of infusion set occlusion.1 The adhesive patch also has an adhesive layer that helps extend wear time and provides comfort and durability for up to 7 days.2 In addition to the new infusion set, the Medtronic Extended reservoir is the only infusion set reservoir tested and cleared to help keep insulin stable and safe to use for up to 7 days.3,4""When patients first begin using a pump, doctors and other healthcare providers reinforce the need to change their infusion set every two to three days to limit the risk of infection and other safety concerns. For many people, this means scheduling life around infusion set changes, which may not be at the most convenient times ― turning around as you are headed out the door when you suddenly remember to change your infusion set or adding a few minutes to a tired child's bedtime routine with an infusion set change,"" said Dr. Robert Vigersky, Chief Medical Officer, Medtronic Diabetes. ""With the Medtronic Extended infusion set, these life interruptions are reduced with an innovation that doubles the wear.""Story continuesIn clinical studies of the Medtronic Extended infusion set, study participants observed a decrease in the number of times an infusion set needed to be changed by 50% and the number of infusion set failures associated with high glucose levels was lowered.3,4 Study participants using the Medtronic Extended infusion set commented on the new infusion set being more comfortable to wear compared to their previous infusion sets and were happy with the longer wear feature in helping reduce the overall burden of insulin pump therapy.3,4""Our goal is to make life easier for individuals living with diabetes and the Medtronic Extended infusion set helps us deliver on this with prolonged and more comfortable wear – something customers have been requesting for many years,"" said Que Dallara, EVP &amp; President, Medtronic Diabetes. ""We couldn't be more pleased to launch this innovation during Diabetes Awareness Month when we take the time to reflect on what more we can do to alleviate the burden for those living with this chronic condition. We're pleased to deliver a groundbreaking innovation that will make a real difference in the overall pump experience given the overwhelming and well-documented benefits of this therapeutic option.""Additionally, use of the Medtronic Extended infusion set is estimated to result in annual costs savings of insulin of up to 25% due to a reduced number of infusion set and reservoir changes that result in unrecoverable insulin, as well as plastic waste reduction of up to 50%.5,6With the U.S. launch of the Medtronic Extended infusion set, this innovation is now available exclusively for customers using MiniMed 600 and 700 series pumps.The Medtronic Extended infusion set was developed in partnership with Convatec Infusion Care, the world's largest producer of infusion sets.

(NYSE: CCI), the nation’s leading provider of shared communications infrastructure, as part of its Connected by Good initiative, announced today a national partnership with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America called “Crown Castle Connects Youth to STEM Program.” It aims to inspire the next generation of young people to envision a future in STEM and support the overall needs of over 50 Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in communities across the country.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2029 jobs in the STEM field should grow 8% – more than double the growth expected for all occupations in the U.S.1 However, diversity in STEM fields is not keeping pace with this growth. Today, too few elementary, middle and high school students are interested in or adequately prepared for STEM subjects.2 This is especially true for youth of color and girls, who are already underrepresented in the STEM workplace. Members of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs on average show more interest in STEM careers than their peers nationally, with 52% of members showing interest compared to the national average of 27%.“Early exposure to STEM is a powerful way to inspire youth to get excited about learning and explore new ways of thinking. With the incredible reach and impact of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, we will be able to impact youth in our communities and ultimately expand their opportunities,” said Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. “At Crown Castle we know building a team of people from a variety of backgrounds, experiences and points of view is key to our innovation and success.”Story continuesOver the next two years, Crown Castle will invest nearly $2 million in the partnership through hands-on employee volunteering and financial support.

Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the largest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 24 million shares worth $372.5 million. Like T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:QRVO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a North Carolina-based company that develops and commercializes technologies and products for wireless, wired, and power markets worldwide. It is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in. In addition to posting market-beating Q3 results, Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) announced a new stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion on November 2.Benchmark analyst Cody Acree on November 3 maintained a Buy recommendation on Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $120 from $152. Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO) reported September quarter revenue and EPS above the midpoint of its outlook and the consensus view, but its positive results were ""largely overshadowed"" by its pessimistic December quarter outlook, the analyst told investors. However, he believes Qorvo, Inc.

(NASDAQ:QRVO) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Qorvo Inc. is one of the two major providers of radio frequency RF systems which are critical components of mobile devices including smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT). Two transitory concerns have recently affected the company’s stock price. First, supply chain issues continue to be a constraint. Second, Apple recently announced its decision to decrease production of its iPhone SE model. Neither of these issues threatens their long-term competitive position. Qorvo’s value is stable and despite the recent pressure on the stock price, we feel its long-term prospects are promising.”9. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) is a Colorado-based company that provides pay-TV services in the United States. The company operates in two segments, Pay-TV and Wireless. It is one of the top 5G stocks to monitor.

Dish Network continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS’s cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish’s long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.”8. Arista Networks, Inc.

(NYSE:ANET) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Arista Networks is the market leader for cloud networking equipment used in data centers for public, private and hybrid cloud deployments. The company’s top line growth has recently been bolstered by 400G deployments—the next generation of tech powering data centers—and further enterprise network penetration as customers migrate away from Cisco (~80% market share vs. ~5% for Arista). While the profit cycle is nicely in motion, we pared our exposure as shares began to approach our PMV estimate.”7. Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spend to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.”6.

(NASDAQ:TMUS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is one of the best 5G stocks to invest in.Here is what Baron Real Estate Fund has to say about American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“American Tower is a leading global tower company with 220,000 communication sites globally and over 40,000 in the U.S. We added to our position during the market dislocation and as it became increasingly clear that the company would put permanent equity financing in place at better-than-expected terms for its previously announced acquisition of CoreSite (thereby removing the “equity overhang”).In addition, the company stepped back from a large potential deal in Europe, which would have required significant incremental funding, due to unfavorable contract terms and price. This decision further reinforced our confidence in management’s capital allocation discipline knowing that these were highly sought-after assets.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy15 Biggest Hedge Funds In the World15 Most Valuable NASDAQ Companies Disclosure: None. 12 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The candidate is combined with platinum-based chemotherapy for treating adult patients with Stage IV (metastatic) non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).Per management, lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer across the world. Out of this, 80-85% of patients are classified as NSCLC. Once the NSCLC metastasizes, patient’s treatment does not respond well to standard therapies. AstraZeneca believes that a checkpoint inhibitor like Imfinzi combined with a limited course of CTLA-4 inhibition by Imjudo benefits patients in the long term.This FDA approval of the Imfinzi+Imjudo combo is based on data from the phase III POSEIDON study, which evaluated the above combination as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC, irrespective of non-squamous or squamous disease. Data from the study showed that participants who received this combination exhibited a 23% reduction in the risk of death compared with those who received a wide range of chemotherapy options. Data from a four-year follow-up of patients also showed that the combination improved overall survival (OS) by 25% compared with chemotherapy alone.Shares of AstraZeneca have gained 7.8% this year compared with the industry’s 2.9% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchImfinzi is already approved for multiple cancer indications. It is already approved for Stage III NSCLC patients following chemotherapy. It is approved for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) and biliary tract cancer (BTC) indications. Last month, the combination of Imfinzi and Imjudo was approved by the FDA for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) in adult patients.AstraZeneca also filed regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination of Imfinzi, Imjudo and chemotherapy in NSCLC in Europe, Japan and several other countries currently under review.Story continuesAstraZeneca’s Imfinzi competes for market share with Keytruda, also a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, developed by Merck MRK. Merck’s Keytruda has been approved for the treatment of multiple cancer indications worldwide, including NSCLC. In the United States alone, Merck received approval for Keytruda in four NSCLC indications.In the first nine months of 2022, Merck recorded $15.5 billion in sales from Keytruda. Sales of Keytruda continue to grow, driven by continued uptake in lung cancer and increasing usage in other cancer indications.In a separate press release, AstraZeneca also announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the combination of Imfinzi plus chemotherapy as a treatment of unresectable or metastatic BTC in adult patients. The CHMP opinion is based on positive data from the phase III TOPAZ-1 study, which showed that the Imfinzi-chemotherapy combination reduced the risk of death by 24% compared with chemotherapy alone. This combination was approved by the FDA for a similar indication this September.AstraZeneca PLC Price AstraZeneca PLC PriceAstraZeneca PLC price | AstraZeneca PLC Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderAstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer Daniels Midland ADM, Charles River Associates CRAI, Murphy USA MUSA, Merck &amp; Co. MRK and New Fortress Energy NFE.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street Cheers Softer Inflation Data: 5 Growth PicksFor the most part of this year, the U.S. stock market has been bleeding owing to stubbornly high inflation, compelling the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy. Consumer spending slowed down because of a hawkish Fed, and consequently, economic growth was disrupted.However, signs of inflation cooling down in the month of October increased investors’ risk appetite, and stocks logged their best rally since 2020 on Nov 10. The Dow surged more than 1,200 points yesterday and closed at its highest level since August.Similarly, the broader S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since Sep 12, while the tech-laden Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day rise in percentage point terms since March 2020.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in fact, noted that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 7.7% from a year ago in October. But the annual rise in inflation was down from September’s 8.2%. At the same time, the CPI increased less than expected in the prior month.What’s more, the core CPI, which excludes goods and service costs, rose 6.3% on an annual basis, slightly below September’s 6.6%, which was incidentally the highest year-over-year jump since August 1982.Nonetheless, thanks to such soft inflation data, the Fed is now widely expected to slow down its pace of rate hikes in the upcoming months, thereby propelling economic growth and boosting stock market returns.Lest we forget, the Fed has already approved its fourth-straight 0.75 percentage point rate hike in early November, taking the benchmark rate to between 3.75% and 4%, the highest in 14 years.Story continuesTalking about stock market returns, the period from November to January usually bodes well for Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500, on average, advanced 4.5% in the said period since 1936, more than its overall three-month average gain of 2.9%, per quantitative analysts at the Bank of America, citing a MarketWatch article.Additionally, stocks tend to do well after midterm elections. As mentioned in the Schwab article, since 1946, in 17 out of 19 midterms, the stock market has given better returns in the six-month period following an election compared to the six months leading up to it. On Nov 8, Americans already voted, so it’s now expected that the stock market would steadily scale upward.Banking on these positive developments, investors should place their bets on fundamentally sound growth stocks. We have highlighted five stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.

This could be attributed to record volumes in the Permian, NGL transportation and fractionation volumes and the integration of TRGP’s Delaware Basin acquisition, along with successfully bringing in two plants in the Permian Basin safely.What Did Targa Resources’ Earnings Unveil?Targa Resources reported a third-quarter 2022 net income of 84 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 but increased from the year-ago profit of 66 cents. The underperformance could be attributed to lower-than-expected sales in the reported quarter and higher expenses.The company’s adjusted EBITDA climbed from $505.9 million a year earlier to $768.6 million in the third quarter of 2022.The third-quarter 2022 distributable cash flow was $594.9 million, about 55% higher than $383.9 million in the year-ago period. Targa Resources paid out a dividend of 35 cents per share, while adjusted free cash flow fell 2.1% from the third quarter of 2021 to $290.8 million. TRGP repurchased shares worth $72.9 million during the July-September period.Moreover, total revenues of $5.36 billion were 20% higher than the year-ago quarter. However, revenues underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.96 billion.Targa Resources, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarga Resources, Inc.

QuoteOperational PerformanceGathering and Processing: The segment recorded an operating margin of $564.6 million during the quarter, up 56.2% from the $361.4 million achieved in the year-ago period. The jump primarily reflects higher Permian Basin volumes that increased 41.7% year over year to average 4,092 million cubic feet per day.Logistics and Transportation: This unit mainly reflects Targa Resources’ downstream operations. The segment’s operating margin of $340.2 million was up 21.2% year over year.Story continuesTRGP saw fractionation volumes rise from 662 thousand barrels per day to 742.1 thousand barrels per day, which is a 12.1% increase year over year. Moreover, NGL pipeline transportation volumes were up significantly too by 20% year over year, while NGL sales improved 4.1%.Costs, Capex &amp; Balance SheetTarga Resources reported product costs of $4.3 billion in the third quarter of 2022, rising 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, TRGP spent $304.1 million on growth capital programs compared with $86.7 million in the year-ago period. As of Sep 30, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $192.9 million and long-term debt of $11 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of around 70%.GuidanceTarga Resources maintained its full-year previous adjusted EBITDA estimate in the band of $2.85-$2.95 billion.The company now anticipates 2022 growth capital expenditures between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, with net maintenance capital spending reiterated at $150 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderTarga Resources currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, Williams expects a leverage ratio midpoint of 3.6, lower than the original guidance of 3.8.MPLX LP MPLX reported third-quarter earnings of 96 cents per unit, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The strong quarterly results were supported by higher contributions from logistics and storage operations and the gathering and processing business.MPLX’s distribution per unit was 77.5 cents for the third quarter, highlighting a 10% hike from the prior distribution of 70.5 cents. The distribution will be paid out on Nov 22, 2022, to common unitholders of record as of Nov 15, 2022.Oceaneering OII reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted profit of 23 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of 13 cents.

By providing comprehensive, unbiased information, NGS has helped diagnose thousands of people with rare diseases, giving clinicians, patients, and families essential information to move forward.In South Carolina, the Greenwood Genetic Center helps lead the charge. Founded in 1974, the nonprofit has five locations across the state, providing genetic screening, clinical care, and science education. Along with Greenwood's care for adults with genetic disorders and cancer, a primary focus is children with rare pediatric disabilities.Michael Friez, who directs Greenwood's diagnostic laboratories, has been with the center since 1998, giving him a front-row seat for the genomics revolution. ""After graduate school, I came to Greenwood to conduct a clinical molecular fellowship,"" he says. ""At the time, the center had just purchased its first single-capillary Sanger instrument. We bought our first next-gen sequencer in 2009. Over the years, incorporating these capabilities has been pretty amazing.""Long-Standing Collaborations with IlluminaFor several years, Greenwood used targeted gene panels. However, because their patients are so genetically diverse, the team adopted whole-exome sequencing (WES, which reads only the gene-coding regions of the genome) in 2014. WES granted them additional clarity in pinpointing the causative variant in a disease. Over the years that followed, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) became more accessible and cost efficient and eventually they had an opportunity to internally test, integrate, and validate the more comprehensive whole genome assay. In 2021, Greenwood took the next step and launched their WGS program.As new technologies emerged, including data solutions, Greenwood has been among the first to bring them online. The center was an early adopter of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that helped accelerate Greenwood's turnaround times by 75%.Story continues""We're using an integrated workflow to do all our alignment and secondary analysis. We connect our secondary analysis with AI capabilities, which ultimately helps us prioritize which variants we think are the most relevant for further review,"" says Friez. This integrated workflow spanning wet lab to dry lab, including informatics solutions and cloud scalability on AWS, streamlined their operation and set them up for growth.Illumina, Monday, November 14, 2022, Press release pictureThe Methylation PuzzleIn recent years, Greenwood has also been working with EpiSign to decipher methylation.Greenwood began diving into epigenetics more than a decade ago, at first to look for connections between abnormal methylation and autism. In 2019, Greenwood and the London Health Sciences Centre, in London, Ontario, adopted EpiSign technology to analyze methylation patterns and clarify variants of uncertain significance.""We are the only lab in the US that offers this as a clinical test,"" Friez says. ""It covers about 130 conditions, and there's really no sign of slowing down in terms of new signature identification.""The Therapeutic GapAlthough genomic technologies answer significant questions for patients and their families, a gap remains in therapy options for rare disease patients. Only a few hundred approved therapies exist for about 8,000 rare diseases. ""There's been a delay in finding viable therapeutics,"" says Friez. ""Gene therapy and related approaches have not played out at the pace many people hoped for. Once we have a diagnosis, the next task is to ask: ‘What can we do to make their life better? Can we connect them to a clinical trial?'""This mindset permeates the organization. Despite their many successes, Friez says the team at Greenwood is always thinking about ""how can we do more for the patient,"" and looking for new possibilities. Friez adds, ""The challenges around diagnostics and therapy selection for rare disease patients make us want to keep pushing harder and keep looking for new angles on how we can leverage the technology to answer those unanswered questions.""To learn more about Illumina's commitment to Expanding Access, click hereIllumina, Monday, November 14, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725513/Greenwood-Genetic-Center-Answering-the-Unanswered]"

""I love being part of the VNG team and continuing to serve our customers.""Hayden grew up in the Hampton, Virginia area, and was born deaf, a disability that never got in his way of pursuing his dreams.""I was born deaf, and sound never existed in my life, so not hearing was completely normal to me,"" he said. ""I just knew that 'normal' people either went to college after high school or looked for a job. I choose the latter.""Hayden tried college life for two weeks after high school and decided it was not for him. Summoning his mom to pick him up at Blue Ridge Community College in Weyers Cave, Virginia, he returned home to start looking for a job.Job hunting is a grueling process but imagine how grueling it could be for someone who is deaf or hearing-impaired. Hayden knew his disability could present challenges for many employers, but he also knew that everyone deserves to be considered for a job just as much as someone without a disability.Story continuesHe began his career with Virginia Natural Gas as a meter reader, then as a storeroom keeper, a position he held for 35 years until 2007.""I was responsible for all the inventory at three separate storerooms during that time,"" said Hayden. ""I moved over from Norfolk to Newport News in 1982 and took care of the storeroom there as well as Hanover and Suffolk. I'm a workaholic and I stayed busy all the time, which was perfect for me.""In 2007, he landed another position with the company, this time going back to his initial first job…meter reading.The VNG meter reading team drives more than 100,000 miles each year, capturing data automatically from a device mounted on company trucks. Hayden knew, he said, he had found the perfect job.""I'm home-based and since I work alone, I can start my day when the sun comes up, sometimes as early as 5:30 a.m.,"" Hayden said. ""it's a great job for someone my age.""While driving his route, Hayden does have the occasional interaction with customers. You may wonder how he communicates with them.""I read lips,"" he said.While not completely deaf, Hayden does have 15% hearing in his left ear and a cochlear implant in his right ear, which he waited until he was 50 years old to have implanted.""I hate it, so I rely on reading lips,"" he added. ""I'm self-taught and as long as I can see you talk, we can have a conversation. But because of my lack of hearing, I must make sure I also keep my head on a swivel, so I know if a dog or person is approaching as well as always being aware of my surroundings.""In his 50 years with the company, Hayden said he has seen a lot of people come and go. But one thing has remained constant…the quality of people that work at VNG.""People here have always treated me with respect and have not made my hearing loss a big deal,"" he said. ""Of course, there are things that I can and can't do, but all my supervisors and teammates have treated me well and taken care of me. They know that my job has been one of the main staple things in my life.""Fifty years ago, Hayden walked through a door of opportunity when it opened, and more importantly, had the courage to walk through it. One day, when the time is right, he said, he'll know when it's time to walk back out through that same door and retire.""I'll know when that time will come, but not today,"" said Hayden. ""When it comes, I'll spend more time on my farm, with my wife and the grandkids. But even then, I really won't be 'retired' since there will always be something to do.""About Virginia Natural GasVirginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

157,4fa5e8c2-987f-3910-8a43-72a101a7d7a9,CI,2022-11-15,Should Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value ETF (RPV) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-p-500-pure-value-112011189.html,1668511211,STORY,"['IVZ', '^GSPC', 'CI']","[Launched on 03/01/2006, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Pure Value ETF (RPV) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $3.58 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.09%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 31.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Energy round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Cigna Corp (CI) accounts for about 2.38% of total assets, followed by Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK/B).The top 10 holdings account for about 17.97% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskRPV seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Pure Value Index before fees and expenses. The S&amp;P 500 Pure Value Index measures the performance of securities that exhibit strong value characteristics in the S&amp;P 500 Index.The ETF has lost about -0.45% so far this year and is up about 0.22% in the last one year (as of 11/15/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $69.84 and $88.24.The ETF has a beta of 1.16 and standard deviation of 32.21% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 122 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesInvesco S&amp;P 500 Pure Value ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, RPV is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $54.53 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $103.44 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.89%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.63%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Heading into today, shares of the athletic apparel maker had gained 21.18% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 15.05% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 11.42% in that time.Nike will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.66, down 20.48% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $12.58 billion, up 10.76% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.97 per share and revenue of $48.97 billion, which would represent changes of -20.8% and +4.84%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.88% lower within the past month. Nike is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Digging into valuation, Nike currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 35.71. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.63.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.67. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Shoes and Retail Apparel was holding an average PEG ratio of 4.67 at yesterday's closing price.The Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 239, putting it in the bottom 6% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here with more on this. Josh, this is an interesting project. A couple of reasons, there seems to be a physical element, at least in the backend, but they really want to open the aperture and speak to the masses somewhat here.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah.DAVE BRIGGS: Fascinating.JOSH SCHAFER: Definitely, Dave. So kind of look at what Dot Swoosh is supposed to be here. So it's a Web3 enabled platform, and it's meant to be a digital community akin to a lot of Nike's other shoe communities, right? And so things you can do are basically co-create a virtual product maybe with a Nike shoe designer, and then you can sell it in the Metaverse-ish, right, in the virtual world, and earn royalties from that. And then eventually the thought is that it can maybe turn into real life products.When you sort of zoom out about what Nike's doing here, guys, it's a bigger part of their brand digital strategy, right, that we've seen grow a lot. That segment grew for them 16% year over year last quarter. And that was what one of the analysts I talked to pointed to. He's a big part of the digital growth. So David Schwartz at Morningstar told me earlier today. He said the move makes sense, given that there is already a big collector community for Nike shoes. And its core customers are the demo that is likely to be early adopters of this kind.So he's sort of getting at the fact that shoe collectors are generally skewing younger, right? We're talking Gen-Z, younger millennials that are currently Nike shoe collectors. They may be more likely to be interested in the Metaverse per se or some kind of Web3 play.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and Josh, I know it's very, very early in the game. But just from what we've heard over the last year, you mentioned the fact that they have been investing in the Metaverse for several months at this point. The interest so far, what does that tell us of just about how big of a priority this could potentially be for a Nike down the road?Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Right, and we should note that the head of this project, Seana, is Ron Faris, who headed Nike sneakers app. And that's their big collectors app that's grown over the years. And so when they put a big name like that in front of our project, that means they want it to work out, right?And I think what Nike is looking to do here is, as the Metaverse grows, as those apps grow, the characters have to wear some kind of clothes, right? And they want them to be wearing Nike shoes like they wear in the real world. Nike dominates the sneaker space, for the most part. Dave and I are both wearing Nike's right now.DAVE BRIGGS: I was just taking a peek at you.JOSH SCHAFER: And I think that they want that to be a part of what happens in the Metaverse and in Web3. One other interesting thing I wanted to point to here, Rachelle, is they mention-- they didn't mention the Metaverse once in the release. I think that's interesting that they don't really want to use that rhetoric when talking about the project.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, we did hear one guest calling it cringe to talk about the Metaverse, saying things are meta these days. But we did see that Nike told Complex, though, that Nike is going to be prioritizing Web3 education with this six-city tour. So really bringing the education part of it so people actually can understand it before they start selling things virtually, how important do you think that is so that people actually get an understanding of what they're getting into?JOSH SCHAFER: Well, it's big, Rachelle, because as we know, knowledge of the Metaverse and Web3 and things like that and even those words, as you just mentioned, kind of scare some people away, right? But Nike shoe collector community is huge. So I think what you're going to see is them trying to merge those two things and bring in someone that maybe collects shoes, but isn't familiar with the Metaverse, isn't familiar with Web3, but is a collector at its core.And this might have utility, Rachelle, too, which is the big thing, right? If it turns into a physical product eventually and becomes-- you create these shoes online and then maybe you can buy them in real life, or you can go to a real experience, or your player on NBA 2K can wear those shoes, that's where these projects tend to make a lot of sense. And that's where it seems like Nike wants to go.DAVE BRIGGS: You got me with that. That's what intrigued me the most, the possibility down the road that I could actually-- well, I wouldn't wear the shoes I design because I got no skills, but I might wear the ones you design. Josh Shafer, good to see you, man. Thank you. Interesting stuff.]"

VTRS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VTRSPeter Lynch Chart of VTRSWhile the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission are pursuing the case, court documents show insider Ramkumar Rayapureddy, who is the CIO of Viatris, conspired with his former colleague, Dayakar Mallu, to trade in Mylan and Viatris securities based inside information the latter obtained via his position at Mylan and in advance of market-moving corporate announcements for their own financial gain. Mallu, the former chief of global IT operations of Mylan (the predecessor company of Viatris), left the company in 2017 and was a close personal friend of Rayapureddy.A relatively new company, Viatris was formed by the merger of Mylan and the Upjohn division of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in November of 2020.From 2017 through 2019, Rayapureddy allegedly tipped Mallu off on multiple occasions with nonpublic inside information about Mylan concerning, among other things, Food and Drug Administration drug approvals, financial earnings and a merger with the UpJohn division of Pfizer. Mallu then used the inside information to execute stock and option trades in the companys securities. According to the FBI, Mallu cleared about $7.2 million with these trades. In return for the tips, Rayapureddy then received cash payments in Indian rupees from Mallu via intermediaries in India.Rayapureddy is charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of securities fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.Story continuesPreviously, in September 2021, Mallu pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and aiding in the preparation of a false tax return and is awaiting sentencing in February. He also pled guilty to tax fraud by filing false tax returns and recycling money through a LLC controlled by him using fake expenses to launder profits.Once they nabbed Mallu, the FBI evidently used information obtained from him to charge Rayapureddy. It remains to be seen if Mallu will testify against his friend to reduce his sentence, but it seems likely.Viatris released the following statement following its former CIO's indictment:""Since the charges against Dayakar Mallu were made public over a year ago, the company has thoroughly and independently assessed all relevant information available to it. We take the governments allegations made today against Ramkumar Rayapureddy very seriously and will continue to review the matter in the same fashion. The company is committed to the highest standards of integrity and compliance with the law. Ramkumar Rayapureddy is on a leave of absence from the company. We have and will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities, and we expect to have no further comment on this matter.""What is insider trading?The SEC, the government agency responsible for enforcing the law against market manipulation, has adopted rules regarding insider trading that define it as any securities transaction made when a person involved in the trade has nonpublic, material information and uses this information to violate his or her duty to maintain the confidentiality of such knowledge by using it for financial gain.Insider information is material if its release would affect a company's stock price. For example, the announcement of a tender offer, a pending merger, a positive or negative earnings report, the pending approval or rejection of a new drug by the FDA, accounting restatements and so on.A person is defined as an insider if they have a relationship with a business that makes them privy to information that has yet to be released to the public. Insiders, especially those in senior management or board positions, have a fiduciary relationship with their companies and shareholders, so trying to profit from insider information puts the insider's interests above those of the entities to whom they owe this duty. This is similar to a lawyer or a doctor using a client or patient's vulnerability to extract an advantage for himself.Not all insider trading is illegal, however. It is perfectly legal for insiders to trade as long as all material information is public and the trades are disclosed and public. In fact, insider trades are avidly followed by investors and analysts to try to determine the positive and negative convictions of insiders.The illegal variety of insider trading occurs when a securities transaction (i.e., purchase or sale of stocks, bonds or derivatives) is influenced by knowledge that only a small group of people inside of the company (the insiders) whose stocks are being traded would know about. This obviously gives the insider an unfair advantage that allows them to profit from information about a potential fluctuation in a company's trading value before others are aware of it. This allows the insider to ""front run"" the market.As in the case with Viatris, sometimes insiders use someone outside the company to do the trades. In these situations, there is a tipper and a tippee. The tipper is the person who has broken his or her fiduciary duty by intentionally revealing confidential information to outsiders. The tippee is the person who knowingly uses that confidential information to make a trade for purposes of turning a profit or avoiding a financial loss.Obviously, the reason insider trading is illegal is because it gives the insider an unfair advantage in the market, puts the interests of the insider above those of shareholders and allows an insider to artificially influence the value of a company's stock. In also undermines the confidence of the investing public in the smooth functioning of the markets.Valuation and financialsWhile Viatris is an unfortunate victim of this breach of faith by its senior-level employee, overall I think the stock is very undervalued. The insider trading does not seem to be material enough to have affected its value.Viatris Insider Trading Scheme BustedAbout half of its revenue is generated from off-patent branded drugs (i.e., Lipitor, Xanax and Viagra), with the rest from generics and non-precription products. The company is using its significant cash flow to develop its pipeline as well as pay a good dividend (currently yielding 4.06%).GuruFocus' proprietary FCF Value is $25.61, more than twice the current stock price. GuruFocus developed the projected free cash flow value to deal with situations where earnings are erratic or obscured by non-cash charges such as in this case. Essentially, the metric takes 80% of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years.In terms of valuation, it is one of the cheapest stocks on the market as it trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of only 3.5. Recent results have been encouraging and the stock is bouncing off its low. At the current price, investors should be very well rewarded in the coming years.ConclusionInsider trading is common and lucrative, yet notoriously hard to prove and prevent. A 2020 study estimated that only about 15% of insider trading in the U.S. is detected and prosecuted. Insider trading is even more prevalent outside the U.S., where markets and regulators are not as advanced.Investors should be aware that insider trading is a possible factor in stock volatility, which may be more common that they think. This is one more reason they should demand a margin of safety in buying stocks, so even if there are sheneganians like this going on (and we never know), they will still be OK.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

""It was all anyone talked about for the first few weeks of the new school year.""The refresh was completed by about 200 employee and contractor volunteers from the maintenance department at Marathon Petroleum's nearby Los Angeles refinery (LAR). Part of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the 6th through 8th grade magnet school became like a second home for Marathon Petroleum personnel during the summer project. Many of them spent nearly every weekend of their summer on the campus, volunteering their time and a variety of skillsets to give the school a complete transformation.Large-scale ProjectVolunteers prepped and painted the entire exterior of the multi-building campus, a complex that dates to 1965. They added several large stairwell murals with assistance from community partner's like Sharefest. They also removed overgrown landscaping and replaced it with thousands of new plants, fresh sod, and added an irrigation system.""Every kid deserves to be proud of where they go to school,"" said Frank Marino, Maintenance Supervisor at the Los Angeles refinery, who also spearheaded the large-scale project that started as soon as the last school year ended in May 2022.Story continues""You could definitely say we worked to the very last minute,"" Marino added. ""Being part of such a transformational project in our community made all of the long hours and time spent away from our friends and families so worth it in the end.""Community-wide ImpactLocated less than 2 miles from the refinery, Carnegie has long been a staple in the community directly south of Los Angeles. Its alumni include current Marathon Petroleum team members.""It's hard to put into words,"" said Antonio Aguilar, an Operator at the refinery who attended Carnegie Middle School. ""This school played such an important role in my life, so after all these years, to be a part of this project-my heart is full.""Principal Torres said he and many others can relate to the feeling.""A project like this effects change beyond these walls-a renewed sense of pride in Carnegie that extends well into the community,"" said Torres.The Los Angeles refinery completed a similar beautification project at Wilmington Park Elementary in the spring of 2021.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Sustainability/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725645/Marathon-Petroleum-Project-Transforms-Middle-School-Near-Los-Angeles-Refinery]"
176,9b3db57c-4731-3a98-80f7-f85af1593226,MPC,2022-11-15,Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-mpc-hits-141502748.html,1668435302,STORY,"['MPC', 'AE']","[Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 16.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $122.69 in the previous session. Marathon Petroleum has gained 89.5% since the start of the year compared to the 44% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 44.8% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 1, 2022, Marathon Petroleum reported EPS of $7.81 versus consensus estimate of $6.8 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 32.43%.For the current fiscal year, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $25.27 per share on $171.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 931.43% change in EPS on a 41.71% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $16.60 per share on $134.81 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -34.3% and -21.34%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMarathon Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Marathon Petroleum has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 4.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 5.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.9X versus its peer group's average of 11.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.21. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Marathon Petroleum passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Marathon Petroleum shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does MPC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MPC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc. (AE). AE has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 51.43%, and for the current fiscal year, AE is expected to post earnings of $4.16 per share on revenue of $3.79 billion.Shares of Adams Resources &amp; Energy, Inc. have gained 30.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 10.82X and a P/CF of 7.39X.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 2% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MPC and AE, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It may not have been easy to hold on to MPC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Marathon Petroleum's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Marathon Petroleum's main business drivers.Findlay, OH-based Marathon Petroleum Corporation is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. The company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2011 spin-off of Houston, TX-based Marathon Oil Corporation’s refining/sales business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity.  In October 2018, Marathon Oil completed the acquisition of its rival Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal, thereby becoming the nationwide largest refining company by market capitalization. The deal also made the company the largest U.S. refiner and the fifth largest in the world by capacity.Marathon Petroleum operates in two segments: Refining and Marketing and Pipeline Transportation.Refining and Marketing: The unit’s operations include 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent regions of the United States, having a combined crude processing capacity of more than 3 million barrels per day. Additionally, Marathon Petroleum – through its marketing organization – sells transportation fuels, asphalt and specialty products throughout the country to support commercial, industrial and retail operations. In 2021, the Refining &amp; Marketing segment recorded a profit of $1 billion.Story continuesMidstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP - publicly-traded master limited partnerships that own and operate gathering and processing assets along with crude transportation and logistics infrastructure. Marathon Petroleum owns 63.6% each of MPLX’s and ANDX’s common units. The 'Midstream' segment reported total earnings of $4.1 billion in 2021.Last year, Marathon Petroleum sold its Speedway business to Japanese retail group Seven &amp; i Holdings – owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain – for $21 billion.As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 billion and a total debt, including that of MPLX, of $25.5 billion.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Marathon Petroleum ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $4,564.38, or a 356.44% gain, as of November 14, 2022. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 189.37% and the price of gold went up -1.54% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for MPC.Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil Refining &amp; Marketing industry in a year (+81.1% versus +32.9%) and is poised for further price gains based on a slew of tailwinds. One of the largest oil refiners in the United States, Marathon’s $21 billion sale of its Speedway retail business provided the company with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream. The company’s exposure to the more stable cash flows from logistics segment diversifies earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed a preferred downstream operator to own now.Shares have gained 16.45% over the past four weeks and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

We are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated.

Yet, markets continue to rally on the assumption that the Fed may lower the magnitude of rate hike from the December FOMC meeting.Momentum Likely to ContinueOn Nov 10, the Department of Labor reported that the consumer price index (CPI) and core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) of October were lighter than expected both month over month and year over year.The decline in CPI and core CPI may be marginal but peak inflation seems to be behind us.

179,a2b4ee1a-452d-3af1-922b-bd5a2776e063,TAP,2022-11-15,3 High-Yield Sin Stocks to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-sin-stocks-194251434.html,1668195771,STORY,"['DEO', 'TAP-A', 'PM']","[Environmental, social, governance (ESG) investing has been a major theme in recent years, as some investors seek exposure to stocks that are actively working on their environmental and social footprint. But it can make sense to look in the opposite direction, too. So-called sin stocks have often provided attractive returns. Sin stocks are a group of companies that produce and sell products that are deemed unhealthy, such as cigarettes and other tobacco products, alcohol and so on.Many of these product categories are very resilient during recessions. Consumers still buy cigarettes, spirits and so on during economic downturns. On top of that, since some investors do not want to invest in sin stocks, their valuations are oftentimes lower than those of other consumer goods companies, which allows for higher entry dividend yields and makes buybacks more effective.Last but not least, a lot of regulation in these product categories means that new market entrants have a hard time, which is why many sin stocks are operating in oligopolies that allow for high margins. The combination of these factors makes sin stocks worthy of research. These tailwinds can drive compelling total returns for those that invest in sin stocks. We will showcase three such sin stocks with attractive dividend yields here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPMPhilip Morris$93.92TAPMolson Coors$51.43DEODiageo$173.53Philip Morris (PM)Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockThe first of these sin stocks to buy is tobacco company Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). Philip Morris sells its products in almost all countries around the world, with the U.S. being an important exception — there, Altria (NYSE:MO) owns the rights to Marlboro and the other brands that Philip Morris controls.Smoking is not a growth market when it comes to sales volumes. However, tobacco companies have a history of increasing the price per pack over time. Despite volumes being flat or even down, tobacco companies have been able to generate solid revenue growth over time. At the same time, price increases allow Philip Morris to grow its margins over time, which is an additional tailwind for the company’s net profits.Story continuesSince cigarette sales volumes do not grow materially, there is no need to invest heavily in new production facilities or machinery. The vast majority of the operating cash flow that Philip Morris generates is thus available as free cash that can be used for dividends or share repurchases, which is why Philip Morris has been offering an attractive income yield for many years.Thanks to the recession-resistant business model, Philip Morris has also been able to grow its dividend very reliably, as the company has increased its dividend every year since it was spun off from Altria 15 years ago. At current prices, Philip Morris offers a dividend yield of 5.5%, which is quite attractive.Based on this year’s expected net profits, the payout ratio is relatively high, at 90%. However, Philip Morris has always operated with a high payout ratio, and it has not stopped the company from increasing its dividend each year. The strong U.S. dollar is a headwind for Philip Morris’ earnings this year, due to its large overseas exposure, but it is likely that the dollar will not continue to strengthen forever, which is why this headwind should wane eventually. This would allow for a lower payout ratio in the future.Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comMolson Coors (NYSE:TAP) is a beer and malt beverage company that has a history dating back almost 250 years. Molson Coors owns brands such as Coors Light, Miller Light, Carling and so on. On top of the U.S., it is also active in a range of additional markets in South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Molson Coors is not the largest beer company in the world, but it’s one with a long history and established brands.Beer demand is not very cyclical, which is why Molson Coors has generally fared well in past recessions. During the first year of the pandemic, its EPS declined only slightly. This was a result of a decline in sales at restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts and so on declined compared to previous years. In 2021, however, Molson Coors already saw its EPS expand again.Based on annual dividends of $1.52, Molson Coors is currently offering a dividend yield of 3%. That’s close to twice as high as the broad market’s dividend yield. Based on the expected net profit for the current year, Molson Coors’ payout ratio is just 39%. This looks very sustainable, especially when we consider that the company does not need to invest a large amount of its cash flows for capital expenditures. Therefore, its free cash conversion is high.Molson Coors reduced its dividend in 2020, and it remains below pre-pandemic levels for now. However, the low payout ratio should allow the company to get the dividend back up to the old $1.96-per-year level in the not-too-distant future.Diageo (DEO)a line up of black label whiskey to represent DEO stockSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comDiageo (NYSE:DEO) is an alcoholic beverage company as well, although it focuses on spirits primarily. Its brands include Jonnie Walker, Smirnoff and Tanqueray. Its history dates back more than 300 years. The company remains headquartered in the U.K., where it was founded in the 17th century.Like Philip Morris and Molson Coors, Diageo has generally been resilient versus recessions and other macro shocks. Demand for alcoholic beverages is not very cyclical. In 2020, Diageo felt a small hit to its earnings, but the company has been hitting new record EPS levels in fiscal 2022 (it is currently in fiscal 2023, which is forecasted to be another record year).The company pays out 47% of its profits, based on this year’s expected EPS and an annual dividend of $4 per share. That makes for a dividend yield of 2.2% at current prices, which is the lowest among these three companies but still easily higher than the yield one can get from the broad market today.Diageo has a solid dividend-growth track record, having increased its dividend reliably in recent years. The dividend growth rate is in the mid-single digits, on average. At current prices, Diageo is trading for just below 20x this year’s expected net profit, which is a low-ish valuation relative to how Diageo was valued in the past. Diageo traded at earnings multiples of more than 20 over the last five years, suggesting right now might be a better-than-average time to enter or expand a position.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

""You'll start seeing more announcements.""Securing more domestic capacity for cathode active materials is one priority, he said.Kunjur said his organization is new within GM, and combines legal teams, merger and acquisition experts and treasury staff to work on joint ventures, equity investments and alliances to secure access to battery and magnet materials or production capacity.Tesla took an early lead in developing in-house battery production in the United States with its first Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada.Among established North American automakers, GM has moved the fastest to emulate Tesla's strategy of building a battery manufacturing network from lithium extraction to assembly of battery packs and cells. GM's Ultium LLC joint venture with LG Energy Solutions has announced plans for four North American battery plants.New federal subsidy policies signed into law in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act could turn that domestic battery supply chain into a federally funded boost for GM's bottom line.The IRA's EV tax credits and subsidies are designed to support domestic EV manufacturing. They could move GM closer to making money on affordably priced electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, which will have a starting price of about $30,000, roughly half the price of a Tesla Model Y.Story continuesThe Inflation Reduction Act ties up to $3,750 per vehicle of federal tax credits to requirements that EV batteries be manufactured in North America using materials sourced in North America or from allied nations.How much GM will reap in federal subsidies will depend on how technical rules are written by federal agencies. Analysts expect Tesla will harvest more overall than any rival through 2030.""We'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in 2 to 3 years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States,"" Barra said during a conference call on Oct. 25.GM has announced 14 deals related to North American battery production since May 2021.GM officials told Reuters the company has about 20 battery supply chain agreements in place, with more to come.Federal subsidies will help GM and its rivals narrow the cost disadvantage new North American battery production operations will face in competition with Chinese battery producers, said Prabhakar Patil, a former executive at battery maker LG Chem.""People who have a head start will have an advantage,"" Patil said.

The share prices don’t tend to fall as much as unprofitable and unproven stocks that are viewed as more speculative investments.Blue-chip stocks also tend to recover faster in periods when the markets rise again. That said, there are plenty of cheap blue-chip stocks that are down 20% or more amid this year’s market rout, presenting attractive entry points for investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven cheap blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.AAPLApple’s$142.60PEPPepsiCo’s$180.19HDHome Depot $310.16VVisa $203.23BACBank of America$37.69BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$296.72FFord$14.17Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comThe consumer electronics giant has not been immune to this year’s market downturn. So far in 2022, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has fallen 25% making it one of the best cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Rather than fret about the selloff, investors should use the decline in the share price to buy Apple stock hand over fist.Silicon Valley-based Apple remains one of the biggest and best technology companies in the world and it is rare that investors get a chance at such a favorable entry point with the stock, which is currently trading at $136 a share.AAPL stock recently took a big hit after it was reported that Covid-19 lockdowns in China are impacting production of its newest iPhone. However, this is a temporary problem. Innovation and market dominance should help Apple weather the current storm.Story continuesLong-term the company, and its stock, should be just fine.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comSnack and beverage company PepsiCo’s (NASDAQ:PEP) share price is actually up this year, having gained 5% compared to a 34% decline in the Nasdaq. PEP stock is currently trading at $180 a share, near its 52-week high.The company’s products, which include everything from the Pepsi soft drink and Frito Lay chips to Quaker Oatmeal and the Gatorade sports drink, are considered essential grocery items by the consumers who love them.In 2021, PepsiCo generated $79 billion in revenue from its food and beverage products. The company barely missed a beat during the Covid-19 pandemic as sales of its consumer products held up remarkably well.PepsiCo is also managing the current inflationary environment thanks to its pricing power, or ability to raise prices without losing customers.Plus, PepsiCo pays a dividend that currently yields a strong 2.54% or $1.15 a share each quarter.In March of this year, PepsiCo announced that it is raising its dividend by 7%, bringing the total increase over the past five years to 43%. The company is also buying back $1.5 billion of PEP stock this year, making it one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to buy with a bright future.Home Depot (HD)Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue skySource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) stock is down 29% this year making it one of the hottest cheap blue-chip stocks to buy. Now is an opportune time to grab HD stock at a deeply discounted price.Long term, Home Depot is likely to remain a great investment given its dominance of the home renovation and do-it-yourself home repair markets. Even with this year’s decline, Home Depot’s stock has still gained 78% over the past five years.The second quarter results this year built on the strongest first-quarter sales on record for Home Depot. Looking ahead, Home Depot has stood by its forecast for total and comparable sales to grow by 3% for all of this year.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V), one of the three largest credit card issuers in the world, currently sits 11% lower than where it was trading at before the pandemic. It is one of the cheap blue-chip stocks to keep your eyes on.Coming out of the pandemic, with travel and in-person dining resuming, V stock was expected by many analysts to rebound strongly.The slow return of higher-margin international transactions on its credit cards has been a drag on the stock.Visa is also grappling with the loss of its Russian business following that country’s invasion of Ukraine. Yet, despite its current issues, Visa remains a solid long-term investment.Over the past five years, the stock has returned 75% to shareholders. Visa is currently selling for 25 times this year’s projected earnings, which is rock bottom for the company.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock looks extremely cheap at its current price. Down 20% on the year amid a broad selloff in all bank stocks, BAC shares are currently one of the cheapest blue-chip stocks to buy before they rebound.The share price decline doesn’t take away from the fact that Bank of America, the second biggest lender in the U.S., remains a very appealing long-term investment.Bank of America should perform well going forward as the interest on its variable rate loans resets at higher levels following rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Additionally, Bank of America has improved its deposit base, which now sits at $1 trillion, and has invested significantly in technology to improve its online presence and electronic transactions.Plus, Bank of America has a big wealth management arm, and its trading unit continues to make hay out of the current stock market volatility. All and all, BAC stock remains a safe bet for investors.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comConsidered by many to be the ultimate blue-chip stock, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has proven time and again that its share price can outperform the market in any environment.And, for now, it’s among the cheap blue-chip stocks that have room to run.Berkshire Hathaway owns a massive portfolio of stocks valued at more than $300 billion.Buffett’s careful portfolio construction and buy-and-hold strategy has famously carried Berkshire Hathaway through many a market downturn, from the Black Monday crash of 1987 to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 and the 2008-09 financial crisis. Each time BRK.B stock has emerged stronger on the other side.The company just reported strong third-quarter financial results that showed a 20% increase in its operating profit. The company also bought back $1 billion of its own stock in the July through September period.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comShares of legendary automaker Ford (NYSE:F) have been beaten up more than most cheap blue-chip stocks this year. The Detroit-based company has seen its share price knocked down 38% year to date.While the market downturn is mostly to blame, Ford has also been hurt by ongoing difficulties with global supply chains that have made it difficult to source the parts needed for its vehicles, which has, in turn, slowed its production.Yet, long term there’s plenty to like about Ford and its stock. The company is pushing hard into electric vehicles and has made no bones about the fact that it wants to challenge market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for supremacy in the space.Electric versions of its iconic vehicles such as the Mustang sports car and F-150 pick-up truck could help the Detroit automaker gain market share and eventually become a global leader in the fast-growing EV sector.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL, V and BAC.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon AMZN, Sanofi SNY, Target Corp. TGT, Humana Inc. HUM and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Amazon, Sanofi and TargetThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon, Sanofi and Target Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Amazon.com have declined -45.2% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s decline of -48.6% and the -17.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.Weighing on Amazon's near-term outlook is the view that the company's strong growth during Covid resulted from pulled forward revenues from future periods that need to be accounted for over the next few quarters. The company is also believed to have over-hired during the pandemic, as a result of which its cost base has signficantly increased.These near-term headwinds aside, it is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is another positive.Also, growing momentum across Amazon Music is contributing well. Additionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers.Further, robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. Additionally, the company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, the Zacks analyst expect 2022 revenue to be up 11% from 2021.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Sanofi’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-12.7% vs. +10.7%). The company is facing headwinds include weak performance of diabetes drugs and generic competition for many drugs. However, Sanofi’s Specialty Care unit is on a strong footing, particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent.Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications expected in the near future, its sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become the primary top-line driver. Its R&amp;D pipeline is strong.Several data read-outs are expected in 2022. Sanofi’s Consumer unit is delivering above market sales growth. Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years and is expanding its pipeline through M&amp;A deals.(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Target’s shares have declined -24.7% this year vs. Walmart's -1.5% drop and the S&amp;P 500 index's -18.2% drop. The market has been unwilling to give Target credit for the inventory growth issue that came through in its April-quarter report in May. This is a relatively favorable set up for the stock should next week's quarterly report turns out to be better than what the market fears.Target has been deploying resources to enhance omni-channel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers seamless shopping experience.Target has been making multiple changes to its business model to adapt and stay relevant in the dynamic retail landscape. These have been contributing to the top line. We believe that Target’s attempt to right-size inventory is the step in the right direction, as the demand skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories.However, this hurt margins as was visible in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 but better position the company to gain market share. The Zacks analyst expect top line to increase 3% and 4.2% in the third- and fourth-quarter, respectively. For the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve sequentially.(You can read the full research report on Target here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Humana Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

COST, Target Corp. TGT, Dollar General Corp. DG and Dollar Tree, Inc. DLTR.Industry: Retail - Discount StoresLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017812/4-stocks-to-watch-as-inflation-hit-consumers-turn-to-discount-storesA strengthening labor market and strategic endeavors undertaken at company levels are working in tandem for the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry. Moreover, the strategy to sell products at discounted rates has helped industry players draw customers who are currently feeling the pinch of rising prices. People’s search for cheaper alternatives, be it essentials or other consumer goods, has been a tailwind for discount stores.Meanwhile, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investment to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp., Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, arts and crafts supplies, toys, and seasonal décor products.These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues3 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers Seek Better Bargains Amid Inflation: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Under the current circumstances, people in the low-to-middle income groups have been showing a preference for discount stores to get quality products at reasonable prices.Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.Digitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

190,5be44509-e9be-3389-b834-6672715cfeb9,TGT,2022-11-15,Breaking Down Walmart (WMT) Vs. Target (TGT) Stock Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-walmart-wmt-vs-002012263.html,1668471612,STORY,"['WMT', 'TGT']","[After last week, 71% of S&amp;P 500 retailers had beaten Zacks EPS estimates. Investors are hoping that Target TGT and Walmart’s WMT earnings reports on November 16 and 15, respectively provide another boost to that figure and top estimates.Individually their Q3 reports will help investors gain a clearer picture of which stock may be better for their portfolio going forward. Let’s see what’s going on with Target and Walmart stock before they report.Inventory IssuesBoth companies have dealt with inflation-related issues throughout the year. TGT stock had a drastic drop after Q1 earnings as excess inventory led to the company selling products at steep discounts. Profits dropped as consumer spending was already slower due to rising inflation. This was compounded by Q2 earnings also missing expectations.Target’s Q1 miss reinforced a Walmart selloff after they also reported disappointing first quarter results the day before TGT’s release. WMT was able to recover and beat Q2 expectations. However, after seeing higher than usual inventory of their own last quarter, Walmart stated this is something the company will be working on in 2023 as well.  In September Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said supply chain problems and now inventory shortages are the most rigid in 30 years. Target surprisingly stated it was past its inventory issues last quarter but this will be something investors will want to monitor for both companies going forward.   Recent Performance Over the last year, Walmart shares have acted somewhat defensive and have recouped most of the losses following the drop after Q1 earnings. Target’s Q1 fall was so steep that TGT is still down -34% over the last year vs. WMT’s -6% and the benchmark’s -16%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, over the last month leading into Q3 earnings, TGT stock has gained momentum up +16% to outperform WMT and the benchmark shown in the cart below. TGT is still down -25% YTD, underperforming WMT’s -4% and the benchmark’s -17%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TGT’s Q3 earnings is $2.14 per share, which would be a decline of -29% from the year prior quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 3% at $26.36 billion. This is an indication that operating costs are weighing on Target’s profits although the company says inventory issues are behind it.For TGT’s current fiscal year, earnings are forecasted to drop -40% at $8.09 per share, with revenue up 3% to $109.79 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to WMT, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 earnings is $1.31 per share, which would be a decline of -9% from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 5% at $147.40 billion. This may be a slight indication that operating costs are weighing down the company’s bottom line in a tougher overall economic environment.For WMT’s current fiscal year earnings are projected to decline -9% at $5.85 per share, with revenue up 5% to 600.64 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough not shown in Target’s EPS picture charts, TGT’s fiscal 2024 estimates are stronger than WMT’s. Target’s bottom line is projected to grow 49% in FY24 to $12.11 vs. WMT’s expected 11% growth at $6.51 per share.Revenue growth for FY24 is roughly the same for both companies, with sales expected to be up 3%. While Walmart may continue having a stronger year, Target’s expected return to growth in FY24 could start making up for the slack this year.Over the last five years, TGT’s growth rate of 22.7% has stretched beyond WMT at 7%. Target’s growth rate has also beaten the S&amp;P 500’s 13.4%. Valuation Turning to valuation, both companies sport “B” grades for Value in the Zacks Style Scores system. TGT currently trades at a 21.4X forward earnings multiple, nicely below its decade-high of 26.8X. In comparison, WMT trades at a 24.3X forward earnings multiple, solidly below its decade-high of 28.1X.From a valuation standpoint, Target looks more attractive relative to Walmart going into Q3 earnings. That said, their future earnings growth or lack there of could recalibrate their earnings multiples.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividends Both stocks have strong dividends, having increased them in each of the last five years. However, the TGT dividend trumps WMT. TGT offers investors a 2.49% annual dividend yield at $4.32 per share, which is considerably higher than WMT’s 1.57% at $2.24 per share.WMT’s annual dividend yield is on par with its Retail Supermarkets Industry average of 1.58% but TGT’s dividend is above its Retail-Discount Stores Industry average of 1.06% and Walmart’s Industry average as well.Bottom LineBoth TGT and WMT land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering which stock to add to the portfolio could very well depend on investors’ risk tolerance and time horizon. Short term, WMT stock may be less volatile than TGT and this has been especially true over the last year. However, TGT’s growth and dividend trump WMT, and Target is more attractively valued at current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That could be a sign the Fed is getting ready to ease the aggressive pace of rate hikes it has been on to tame inflation. Slowing the pace of rate hikes is something Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard suggested in comments on Monday.Brainard told Bloomberg News “it will probably be appropriate soon to move to a slower pace of rate increases.”That helped boost stocks, which had been trading lower before she spoke.Data on retail sales for October comes out Wednesday. Analysts expect sales to rise 1% from the prior month, when sales were flat.Walmart is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, along with Home Depot . Target (NYSE:TGT) follows on Wednesday. Analysts will be watching trends in same store sales and listening for what executives say about the holiday sales season.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow;1. Producer pricesThe producer price index for October is due out at 8:30 ET (13:30 GMT). Analysts expect core PPI to rise 7.2%, same as the previous month, on an annualized basis, and core PPI to rise 0.3% from September. On a topline basis, analysts expect annual PPI to rise 8.3%, a slower pace than September, and 0.4% for the month.2. Walmart earningsThe biggest U.S. retailer Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.32 on revenue of $147.6 billion.3.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $26.36 billion, indicating growth of 2.7% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have declined year over year. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has risen by a couple of cents to $2.14 over the past 30 days, the figure suggests a sharp decline from the earnings of $3.03 from the year-ago period.We expect revenues to be up 2.5% year over year to $26,300.6 million and the bottom line to decline 31.6% to $2.07 per share.Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 13.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45.1%.Key Factors to NoteTarget has been deploying resources to enhance omnichannel capabilities, come up with new brands, refurbish stores and expand same-day delivery options to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience. It has been ramping up store openings and remodels, scaling up fulfillment services and enhancing supply-chain capabilities. Customers have been opting for Target due to its multi-category assortment of owned and exclusive brands and popular national brands.Cumulatively, the aforementioned factors are likely to have contributed to the company’s sales performance. We expect comparable sales to increase 2.3% during the quarter under discussion.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation QuoteWe believe that Target’s recent attempt to rightsize the inventory is in the right direction as the demand is skewed toward consumer staples and away from discretionary categories. However, a slew of actions to tackle the excess inventory, such as additional markdowns, is likely to have weighed on margins. Additionally, the increased compensation and headcount in distribution centers might have hurt the gross margin rate.Management expects the third-quarter operating margin rate to be lower than the prior-year period. We expect the third-quarter operating margin to shrink 280 basis points.However, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors to offset inflationary pressures and driving continued operating efficiencies. Also, Target remains focused on maintaining strength in frequency categories like Food &amp; Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Target this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.

Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products, and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Clearly, companies are leaving no stone unturned to tap any surge in demand.Story continuesDigitization is Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives such as building omni-channel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at store are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, tight labor market and supply-chain headwinds. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

(V) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-visa-inc-v-140002428.html,1668434402,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +12.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 13%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.01 per share, indicating a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.32 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.9%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.61 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.95 billion and $35.7 billion estimates indicate +9% and +11.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa.

The Company has effectively managed its high-quality portfolio of real estate investments, fortified its balance sheet, substantially added to its pipeline of development opportunities, sourced growth capital and simplified its story through further separation from AIR Communities. These important milestones were reached more than a year earlier than originally projected.The implementation and acceleration of the Aimco strategy has resulted in total stockholder returns of 45%1, significantly outperforming the Company’s identified developer peer group2, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index, the MSCI US REIT Index, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index.The Company has also consistently prioritized investor engagement and, over the past 13 months, has met with stockholders representing more than 80% of Aimco’s outstanding shares of common stock.As a direct result of these discussions and the maturing of the Aimco business, Dary Stone, Chairman of the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee, announced that the Board has decided to take the following actions:Declassify the Board in 2023: Given the success of Aimco’s strategic plan, the Aimco Board will accelerate the Company’s previously planned transition to annual elections for all directors for one-year terms beginning at the 2023 annual meeting.Opt out of MUTA: The Aimco Board will opt out of the provisions of the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act, or MUTA, that allow it to re-classify the Board without the approval of stockholders.Transition Timing of the Annual Meeting Date: The Board intends to move the date of the Company’s annual meeting so the 2024 annual meeting will be held by the end of the second quarter of 2024.Story continuesWhile Aimco’s reconstituted Board and new management team have outlined and implemented a clear strategy for the Company that has delivered strong results, the Board is mindful that Aimco shares have continued to trade at a meaningful discount to the inherent value of the Company’s assets and growing platform.Therefore, the Aimco Board is overseeing the evaluation of a broad range of options to enhance stockholder value, including, but not limited to, structural alternatives for the Company’s assets, new capitalization and financing strategies for Aimco’s development platform and pipeline, monetization of certain of the Company’s assets and accelerated share repurchases.The evaluation and execution of a value enhancing plan will carefully consider the current market conditions and is being led by the Board’s Investment Committee, chaired by Michael Stein, who has considerable experience with similar efforts to unlock stockholder value.There can be no assurance that the review will result in any transaction or other change or outcome. Aimco does not intend to comment further until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.1 From spinoff date (December 14, 2020) through October 31, 20222 Includes AHH, CLPR, CSR, ELME, FOR, FPH, HHC, IRT, JBGS, JOE, STRS, TRC, and VRE (per AIV 2021 10 K); represents simple averageAbout AimcoAimco is a diversified real estate company primarily focused on value add, opportunistic, and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.

212,36928d42-abd8-3250-b4ea-16c8abd695b9,NVDA,2022-11-15,Arista Networks and Skechers have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arista-networks-skechers-highlighted-zacks-094509580.html,1668505509,STORY,"['SKX', 'NVDA', 'ANET']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 15, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Arista Networks ANET as the Bull of the Day and Skechers SKX asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Zscaler ZS and Coupa Software COUP.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Arista Networks is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops markets, and sells cloud networking solutions globally. The company offers cloud networking solutions that consist of extensible operating systems, a set of network applications, as well as gigabit Ethernet switching and routing platforms.The stock struggled for most of the year as many tech stocks have in 2022. However, unlike others in the tech space, Arista continues to outperform on earnings.Recently, the company proved its earnings momentum once again, helping the stock spike above its summer highs. Now ANET is only down only 13% from all-time highs. Relatively speaking, investors should be happy with this performance and looking to the year ahead, we should see the stock post new highs.More About ANETThe company incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It employs about 3,000 people and has a market cap of $39 billion. The company went public in June 2014 and currently has more than 7,000 cloud customers worldwide.Impressive Earnings Momentum The relative strength in the stock should not be ignored. There are a handful of well-known tech stocks down over 70% this year. The reason for this has been overvalued names that do not live up to earnings expectations.For Arista, the stock has beaten the Nasdaq this year for two reasons:First, the valuation is not inflated, with the Forward PE at 30. Because of this, the stock has not been shorted and sold as hard as other tech names with lofty valuations.Second, the company continues to beat on earnings, not once missing EPS since going public.Looking at their most recent quarter, Q3 came in with a 19% EPS beat. ANET reported $1.25 v the $1.05 expected and revenues came in at $1.18B v the $1.06B expected.Story continuesArista also guided Q4 higher, now seeing a range of $1.18-1.20B v the $1.10B expected. Gross margins were lower year over year, but operating margins came in above last years.Estimates RisingAnalysts were impressed with the quarter and have taken their numbers higher across all time frames.Since earnings, current quarter estimates have gone from $1.07 to $1.19, or 11% higher. Expectations for next quarter have been lifted as well, with estimates going up by 16%.Looking down the road, the numbers continue to tick higher. For the current year, we have seen estimates go from $4.04 to $4.33 over the last month. This 7% bump higher is impressive, but nothing compared to the 12% spike in estimates that Arista is seeing for next year.After earnings, a handful of analysts also lifted their price targets. Citi reiterate ANET with a Buy and $190 target, up from $170. Morgan Stanley lifted to $130 from $115 and kept its equal weight. Barclays has an Overweight and a $143 target, which they lifted from $131.The Technical TakeThe stock made all-time highs at $148.57 late last year. Over the summer, when markets were very weak, the stock bottomed at $89.12. Since then, two earnings beats have helped the stock come up over 40% off those 2022 lows.So now, investors should be looking to find entries into this stock as the overall market stabilizes.The low made this summer happened to be the 50% retracement made from COVID lows to all-time highs. If we are targeting the -23.6% Fibonacci level, this gives us targets at $174 or 35% higher from the current price.While its hard to chase after a big move higher, investors can wait for pullbacks and look at moving averages. For ANET, the 21-day ,50-day, and 200-day moving averages are all in the same area, between the $115 and $118 levels. That area should be a massive support zone where investors can enter.In SummaryIn bear markets, stocks showing relative strength should not be ignored. They are strong for a reason and when markets turn, they can be outperformers for the next trading year and beyond.Investors should watch this one closely and look to enter on pullbacks. The stock should hold up well the rest of the year and look to take out all-time highs in 2023.Bear of the Day:Skechers is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear for men, women, and children in the United States and overseas. The company offers casual, casual athletic, sport athletic, trail, sandals, boots, and retro fashion footwear for men and women.The stock is 25% off 2022 lows, so are investors getting ahead of themselves?Analysts are pumping the breaks, dropping estimates for the upcoming quarter and year. Considering the upwards move and estimates, profit taking should be considered.More About SKXSkechers was founded in 1992, is headquartered in Manhattan Beach, CA. The company is valued just over $6 billion and has a Forward PE of 18. SKX has Zacks Style Scores of “D” in Value and “F” in Growth.Skechers operates about 4,300 company-and third party owned stores and sells its products through department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, boutiques, and online retailers; and through its e-commerce sites, concept stores, and factory and warehouse outlet stores.The company operates through four segments: Domestic Wholesale, International Wholesale, Retail Sales and e-commerce Sales. Skechers brands include Skechers USA, Skechers Sport, Skechers Active, Modern Comfort, Skechers Street, Twinkle Toes, Z-Strap, Skechers Stretch Fit, Skechers GOrun and many more.Q4 EarningsSkecher’s has a volatile earnings past, but the company has beaten 9 out of the last 12 quarters. However, when they reported in late October, Skechers reported their first miss in a year.For Q3, Skechers posted revenue beat, but a 26% EPS miss. This miss included an unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange rates.The company guided Q4 down significantly. Revenues for Q4 are now expected to be in a range of $1.73-1.78B v the 1.82B prior. Q4 EPS is now seen at a range of $0.30-0.40 v the expected $0.57.Year over year gross margins feel to 47.1% b the 49.9% last year.EstimatesThe cut in guidance forced analyst to drop their numbers, with estimates falling significantly since earnings.Over the last 30 days, number have fallen across all time frames. For the current quarter, estimates have gone from $0.57 to $0.34, a drop of 40%. For the current year, estimates dropped to $2.25 from $2.65, or 15%.The numbers do not improve much for next year, with estimates dropping almost 11%.Argus downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy after earnings. The firm cites supply chain disruptions and China COVID restrictions as headwinds for the stock.The TechnicalsThe stock has struggled over the last year, falling almost 30% from 2021 highs. However, the last couple weeks the stock has surged over 20% after the company reported the earnings miss.The stock has now broken the 200-day moving average and hit highs not seen since August. Normally this would be a bullish sign and there might be some short covering in the works.But the $42 level has been a tough nut to crack this year. This stock has failed four times already in 2022 and given the fundamental challenges, this spot would likely see resistance again.Investors would be better off taking profits and waiting for conditions to improve. If a entry is desired, the $35.30 area is the 50-day moving average and would likely offer some support.In SummaryConsidering the rally over the last few weeks, investors should be very cautious. The stock has come well off lows after a quarter where the outlook was not good. This can be a good sign if the overall market continues momentum.However, due to supply chain issues and China COVID lockdowns, Skechers will likely see their fundamentals woes to persist over the short term. Investors should take the rally as an opportunity to sell and revisit the name down the road.Additional content:Will Weak Gaming Chip Demand Hurt NVIDIA's Q3 Earnings?NVIDIA Corp. is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Nov 16.NVIDIA impressed investors with its stellar financial performance and experienced robust top and bottom-line growth in the past several quarters. However, the weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets has put a break on its growth momentum as depicted from the last reported quarter.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, though NVIDIA’s revenues of $6.7 billion met the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues came lower than management’s May 2022 forecast of $8.10 billion (+/-2%) due to weaker sales across its Gaming and Data Center business segments. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings plunged 51% year over year to 51 cents per share.The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. In its second-quarter earnings release, the company stated that revenues from its Gaming market segments would decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners continue to reduce inventory levels.NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteSoftness in Gaming Chip DemandNVIDIA experienced robust sales for its chips used in gaming end markets for the past couple of years. This was driven by pandemic-induced stay-at-home instructions.The demand for NVIDIA’s gaming chips increased immensely as people were surfing games to stay engaged and entertained indoors during lockdowns. Moreover, with the massive emergence of multiplayer online games and Gaming-as-a-Service concepts, the demand for graphic processing units shot up exponentially.However, the reopening of economies, along with the rising global slowdown concern amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China trade war, has been hurting the demand for gaming chips.The company’s revenues from the Gaming market platform plunged 33% year over year and 44% sequentially in the last reported quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Gaming segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, indicating a 56.6% decline from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $3.22 billion.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of NVDA have decreased 44.5% year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering from the broader technology sector are Zscaler and Coupa Software. Celestica and Zscaler each sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, while Coupa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

213,060a0c6d-30af-39ea-bddc-64f050f0f714,NVDA,2022-11-15,Evaluating NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Down 50% Before Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/evaluating-nvidia-nvda-stock-down-010801369.html,1668474481,STORY,"['NVDA', 'AMD']","[Trading 53% from its highs, NVIDIA’s NVDA third quarter FY23 earnings will start to lay out a broader picture for semiconductors stocks going forward.Fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices AMD reported earnings earlier in the month that were on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMD shares have started to climb along with the recent boost in markets after better than expected CPI numbers last week. Now let’s look at NVIDIA to see if it might be able to start to rebound.NVDA’s Significance Investor sentiment toward semiconductors stocks this year has been low as consumers strayed away from technology products during a high inflationary environment. NVDA’s Q3 report will be crucial for Wall Street to see that one of the largest chip makers can start adapting to economic conditions where operating challenges have persisted for most companies.As a worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU) NVDA has evolved its focus from PC graphics to add artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high-performance computing (HPC), gaming, virtual reality (VR) platforms, and more.NVIDIA’s advancements have made it a major player among big tech stocks as well. Among the top 10 largest components of the Nasdaq 100, NVDA’s performance is often a barometer of the health of the technology sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVDA’s performance over the last year has been significantly worse than the benchmark and drained the Nasdaq alongside most other big tech and growth stocks with Meta Platforms META notablly down big as well. This puts a ton of pressure on NVDA’s Q3 earnings and outlook if the stock hopes to turn things around in the near term.Q3 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA’s Q3 earnings is $0.71 per share, which would be a decline of -39% from $1.17 in the year prior quarter. Earnings estimates have largely trended down from $1.07 at the beginning of the quarter. Sales for Q3 are expected to be down -16% to $5.95 billionStory continuesYear over year, NVDA earnings are expected to decline -23% in fiscal 2023 at $3.42 per share. FY24 earnings are projected to stabilize and jump 31% to $4.50. Sales are expected to be up 1% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 13% in FY24 to $31.05 billion. This has the company in line to almost triple its 2020 revenue of $10.9 billion.Performance &amp; Valuation                NVDA is down -44% YTD to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -17% and the Nasdaq’s -28%. Over the last decade, NVDA stock is still up an astonishing +5,639% to crush the benchmark and the broader technology sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors are certainly hoping that this year’s decline in NVDA turns out to be a long-term buying opportunity.Trading around $163 per share NVDA trades at 47.7X forward earnings. This is above the industry average of 10.3X, but Wall Street has been okay with paying a premium for NVDA shares because of the company’s growth and technological advancement. NVDA also trades at a discount to its decade-high of 93.5X and near the median of 37X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineNVDA currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Semiconductor-General Industry is in the top 37% of over 250 Zacks Industries. The company’s Q3 report and more importantly its outlook will give an idea of how the company is dealing with the challenging operating environment.NVIDIA trades at discount relative to its past and longer-term investors may be rewarded for holding the stock given its historical performance. Despite headwinds in fiscal 2023, the company is expected to return to growth in FY24 and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 25% upside from current levels.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Together, they enable the safe and effective validation, deployment and evaluation of medical imaging AI models.Mass General Brigham is among the first major medical centers to use MONAI and the Nuance Precision Imaging Network to define a unique workflow that links medical-imaging model development, application packaging, deployment and clinical feedback for model refinement. It has more than 80,000 employees providing care to 1.5 million patients annually, with $2.3 billion in annual research spending.Using the combined offering, the medical center has deployed a breast density AI model that has reduced the waiting period for results from several days to just 15 minutes. Women can now talk to a clinician about the results of their scan and discuss next steps before they leave the facility, rather than going through the stress and anxiety of waiting for results.""With the combination of NVIDIA's and Nuance's technologies, our AI researchers can focus on training and developing their models rather than doing all the plumbing underneath,"" said Dr. Keith J. Dreyer, Chief Data Science Officer, Mass General Brigham. ""That makes it simpler to get AI-powered insights to our clinicians, so they can provide the best possible care, accelerate time to treatment and improve patient outcomes.""Story continuesThe continuous clinic-to-research feedback loop reduces model adaptation times from years to weeks. Domain shifts in data now take weeks instead of months, and issue detection and repair takes minutes rather than hours. It has also allowed Mass General Brigham to reduce medical-imaging AI application development and maintenance costs.""Adoption of radiology AI at scale has traditionally been constrained by the complexity of clinical workflows and the lack of standards, applications and deployment platforms,"" said David Niewolny, Director, Healthcare Business Development, NVIDIA. ""This partnership clears those barriers, enabling the extraordinary capabilities of AI to be delivered right at the point of care, faster than ever before.""""The strategic partnership between Nuance and NVIDIA makes the process of deploying trained diagnostic imaging AI models into existing clinical applications at scale simpler for everyone. With this joint effort, we are effectively tackling the problem of how you get medical insights from the 'bench' to the bedside,"" said Peter Durlach, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Nuance Communications. ""Imaging AI developers will now be able to deploy their solutions much faster, helping transform imaging workflows to improve patient outcomes and health system financial performance.""Powered by Microsoft Azure, the Nuance Precision Imaging Network provides access to an entire ecosystem of AI-powered tools and insights within clinical workflows to more than 12,000 healthcare facilities and the 80% of U.S. radiologists who use Nuance's PowerScribe radiology reporting and PowerShare image sharing solutions.MONAI was built by the medical imaging community to transform research breakthroughs and AI applications into clinical impact. It includes MONAI Deploy, the accelerated processing pipeline that delivers MONAI Application Packages (MAPs), which easily integrate into healthcare systems, using interoperability standards such as DICOM, across data center and cloud environments.To learn more, read Nuance's whitepaper here.About NVIDIASince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

222,288b11b3-7bc4-313a-8ed0-25a4adaeebcc,MCK,2022-11-15,Here's Why You Should Retain Patterson Companies (PDCO) Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-patterson-companies-124612017.html,1668429972,STORY,"['PDCO', 'AMN', 'MCK']","[Patterson Companies, Inc.’s PDCO broad product line is driving its prospects. The company reported robust revenue growth for first-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. The trend is expected to continue. However, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 0.9% compared with a 15.6% fall of the industry and the S&amp;P 500’s 17.5% decline.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.82 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to continue their strong growth for the next five years at an annual rate of 8%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering a surprise of 9.25%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about Patterson Companies’ wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. A notable offering from the company is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during first-quarter fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broader private-label portfolio. Patterson Companies’ NaVetor is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment (launched in fiscal 2019).Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are expected to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Per a report by Verified Market Research, the dental equipment market was valued at $7.41 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $10.25 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 4.8%. Although sales at this segment were down 8.1% year over year during first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Story continuesSolid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: Patterson Companies' growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management at Patterson Companies expects solid margin improvement in the Animal Health unit through stronger partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. Both the company’s companion animal and production animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. In fact, the company is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well-poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. On the first-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call, the company stated that it had monetized a portion of its investment in Vetsource during this period, thereby leading to an investment gain. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered internal sales growth of 5.7%, owing to sustained strength in the production animal business. The Animal Health segment delivered gross margin and operating margin improvement in the quarter under review on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.DownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Patterson Companies faces competition not only from other national and full-service firms but also from at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level besides hundreds of small local distributors. Patterson Companies needs to consistently introduce products to withstand competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute the company’s market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: Patterson Companies faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a stable estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings in fiscal 2023 remained at $2.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.69 billion, suggesting a 2.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Patterson Companies, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 5.9% and 8.1%, marking their biggest weekly gains since June and March, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.2%.The week’s gains were led by the latest CPI numbers, which showed that inflation and core inflation had grown less than expected year over year in October, and headline inflation had declined from its June peak. This, and the expectation of a less hawkish Fed, tempered the buy-the-dip view.China relaxed a few of its stringent COVID-19 measures during the week, increasing optimism in the market and sending crude prices higher. However, investors remained apprehensive about a global recession in 2023 and are likely to tread carefully, keeping an eye on the direction in which the Fed will take the economy.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans. In an extended period of higher inflation, like the one we are confronted with today, dividend growth stocks provide a hedge against rising costs with stable income.

During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%. This shows that dividend growth stocks offer an excellent way to generate passive income during inflationary periods.Dividend stocks have remained a significant component of total market returns in the past. In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us with the details. Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, guys. Yeah, so it's been a rough week for Disney. We saw this miss on both the top and bottom lines, accelerated losses within the streaming division. $1.5 billion loss in Q4, and that followed a $1.1 billion loss in Q3. Disney says, look, Disney Plus, we're still on track to be profitable by 2024. How do you do that? Through cost-cutting measures. So CEO Bob Chapek, he wrote to division leaders on Friday. Yahoo Finance was able to obtain that company memo. And here's what we learned.Number one, the company has established a call structure task force. Now, this will be headed by Disney CFO Christine McCarthy, General Counsel Horacio Gutierrez, and then Chapek. And these three individuals will be making those big objective decisions when it comes to cost management. And Chapek said that they've already undertaken a rigorous review of the company's content and marketing spending, so that's likely to change.Chapek also warned of potential layoffs. He said, it's very likely that we're going to have to let people go as part of this effort-- and then hiring freezes. So this is something that we've really seen across the tech sector, along with media as well. And again, it's all in this effort to reach profitability by 2024. Management did guide that by the first quarter of 2023, losses should shrink by about $200 million. So that's something to look out for. But overall, I'm not surprised that we're hearing this from Disney at this point.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it's interesting that there's a task force to cut costs.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Right? It sounds very scary, in a way.JULIE HYMAN: Well, but also, like-- well, you know, it's sort of creating another level of bureaucracy or something. Anyway, when we look throughout the company, where are the areas that are most likely to see kind of retrenching or layoffs or cutbacks of some kind? What are the sort of the weakest points?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I think right now the focus is on direct to consumer and within streaming. Of course, with Disney Plus, we have the advertising tier coming out next month. So that's something that they're hoping that they could add to profitability.We saw them add users in the quarter, but that's clearly not enough. We have high content spend. We have these various macroeconomic challenges. That's obviously weighing on the advertising sector as well. So I think they're going to take a hard look across all of their streaming divisions, Disney Plus included, and really look at their content, strategize how much they need to be spending on these various different movies and TV shows. Do they need to focus on more Star Wars content or more Marvel?Or perhaps, maybe we need to focus completely differently. Maybe we need to attract a new type of user onto the platform as well. So I'm curious to see what will come out of this. But definitely, things are going to change.BRAD SMITH: Additionally, on the box office front, over the weekend, we had the much anticipated new ""Black Panther"" movie. That also debuted. How did it do? AMC CMO Adam Aron-- or CEO, excuse me, the chief ape, if you will.JULIE HYMAN: Yes. He kind of is also the CMO, actually.[LAUGHTER]BRAD SMITH: Well, yes, yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, the tweet.BRAD SMITH: Freudian slip, but still accurate there. So what do we see over the course of this one?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, he was definitely happy. I mean, that stock was up as much as 10% earlier today. Shares have pared back a little bit now but still up about 6%. But it was a big start for ""Wakanda Forever."" The movie pulled in $180 million domestically. That was above expectations. It still didn't reach what we saw in 2018 with the original ""Black Panther."" That debuted to a $202 million opening.But the sequel, it had a little bit more going against it. It had a longer run time of 2 hours and 41 minutes. We had the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. There was some concern that the more casual moviegoer, people that really loved him in that role, could maybe be a little hesitant to return to the theater. But we clearly saw that that wasn't the case. We actually saw more women come to the movie compared to some other Marvel films. 47% identifying as female according to analytics platform intelligence. So that was something encouraging to see.And then if you take a look at your screen now, those are the three biggest opening weekends since the start of the pandemic. ""Wakanda Forever"" makes that list, coming in third behind ""Spider-Man, No Way Home"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."" So Marvel domination is alive and well. And I think the expectation is that we're going to see this film continue to do well, especially through the holidays. And then, of course, we round out with ""Avatar, The Way of Water.""BRAD SMITH: It's great that you say that too. I've heard so many people say that they're going to go see this for Thanksgiving weekend. So you could see even more of a boost later on during this holiday season.JULIE HYMAN: With their families.BRAD SMITH: Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: OK, you're the only one on set right now who's seen it, I believe. Soz, you didn't see it?BRIAN SOZZI: Didn't see it.JULIE HYMAN: Quick review, capsule review?BRAD SMITH: Capsule review-- the women leads in this movie were amazing all throughout. I'd love to see the new, of course, technology that they talk about. And of course, it's all conceptualized because it is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and MCU always dominates in that. But I think it comes down to the different theater experiences that people might see it in-- IMAX versus a 3D version. Even so, I don't know. I might actually go back and see this in IMAX.JULIE HYMAN: You can do a twofer. Nice.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I'll do a twofer.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I think IMAX--BRAD SMITH: Just for a different experience.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --is the way to go too, just for the action scenes, the music, everything.BRAD SMITH: I was sitting too close. I bought my tickets late, and so I was looking up like this the entire time.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You got to get a massage after, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Oh my goodness.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Your neck is probably all torn up.BRAD SMITH: I was not in the state for myself to be viewing a movie in that capacity.JULIE HYMAN: OK, this is news I can use because I'm going to go see it this weekend. So I've got to get my tickets now to make sure that doesn't happen to me.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.]"

""We can't underestimate how much that will extend beyond just the usual Marvel fans that show up and what that means for diversity and for the moviegoing population.""Story continuesDespite the sequel's lower start, the results have been praised by industry insiders given the film's longer run time of 2 hours and 41 minutes, in addition to the untimely passing of original lead star Chadwick Boseman, who does not appear in the sequel.The film pulled in 12.7 million patrons this past weekend with an audience that was 53% male and 47% female, according to estimates from box office analytics platform EntTelligence.""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" was the only other film in 2022 that was able to pull in more ticket buyers — approximately 13.7 million total moviegoers.National ticket prices averaged $13.71 across the U.S. with premium tickets priced at $17.24 while non-premium tickets cost $12.63, EntTelligence noted. The top five attended markets included Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, San Francisco, and Chicago.Disney's 'Avatar' (Courtesy: 20th Century Studios)After ""Wakanda Forever,"" the next big movie on tap is James Cameron's ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" (rolling out Dec. 16), which, according to Robbins, will set theaters up for a strong sprint into 2023.""At that point, when the calendar rolls over, things start to look a little more normal,"" he said. ""There might be a few slow spots in January, but they're not going to compare in any way, shape, or form to how slow things were last winter.""IMAX (IMAX) CEO Richard Gelfond struck a similar, optimistic tone when it came to ""Avatar's"" upcoming debut, referencing the original's stunning performance 13 years ago during an interview with Yahoo Finance Live.""[Avatar] is still our biggest grossing movie of all time,"" Gelfond said, noting that IMAX theaters have only grown since that time.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.55 billion, suggesting growth of 24% from the year-ago reported figure.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW’s non-GAAP earnings stands at 68 cents per share, indicating an increase of 23.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 55 cents.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.5%.Factors to ConsiderIn first-quarter fiscal 2023, Palo Alto is likely to have benefited from strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is further expected to have boosted its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly the machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.Palo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud, and Xpanse, which forms the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal first quarter as well.The growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 22% and 23% ($1.68 billion-$1.70 billion) during the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, increased use of cloud and remote networks amid a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks currently. This is leading to a rise in demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.Story continuesFurthermore, Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto’s products by government organizations. The company’s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.This FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector’s trust in Palo Alto’s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.However, higher sales incentives related to Next-Generation Security products are expected to have hurt the company’s bottom line. Additionally, forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are expected to have weighed on the company’s profitability during the fiscal first quarter. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are likely to have dragged down margins.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PANW this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here.PANW currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

The company is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Nov 16. Helmerich &amp; Payne’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 118.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HP’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings stands at 43 cents per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 169.4%.

The company is anticipated to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Dec 8. lululemon’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LULU’s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.95 per share, indicating a 20.4% surge from the year-ago quarter’s $1.62 per share.

HP may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Helmerich &amp; Payne is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 49 cents per share for HP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +15.10% heading into earnings season.Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Helmerich &amp; Payne, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

243,e8034099-0b05-33ab-9371-29c543822d88,NDAQ,2022-11-15,Nasdaq ESG Trendsetters: Etsy,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-esg-trendsetters-etsy-151000307.html,1668438600,STORY,"['ETSY', 'NDAQ']","[Nasdaq's ESG Trendsetters series highlights the top ESG professionals and teams around the world who go the extra mile in their evolving ESG roles. Discover how leading ESG companies are incorporating ESG factors into their corporate strategy, achieving meaningful impact and communicating with their stakeholdersNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 14, 2022 / Etsy, a global marketplace for unique and creative goods, fits the definition of a trendsetter. The company embeds ESG into its corporate strategy, integrates ESG metrics into its financial reporting, and has been named an award-winning ESG program, but Etsy is not standing still. Let's hear from the many groups responsible for Etsy's ESG program and how they look to stay ahead of the curve and set the trend. This is ESG Trendsetters.Why is ESG important to Etsy?At Etsy, where our mission is to 'Keep Commerce Human,' our economic, social and ecological impact goals are deeply integrated into all aspects of our business. We launched our Impact Strategy in 2017, which included setting economic, ecological, and social goals for our company that are specific, measurable and time-bound. We are values-aligned and apply the same focus and discipline to our impact metrics as we do to our financial metrics. Together, they make us stronger and more resilient.Understanding that ESG is often a team effort, can you share a bit about how Etsy addressed this? What are the benefits of that structure of IR involvement, and do you think IR/ESG should be combined or separate?Etsy acknowledged a few years ago that Impact/ESG are really cross-functional and require the work of many individuals in order to be fully integrated and effective. If only one team is held accountable for goals, how can these issues be truly addressed and impacted? By creating top-down goals that we are all focused on - across the company from our Board of Directors, our CEO on down - and then having cross-functional goal owners of each area, all being reported on externally, this makes us much more accountable. Everyone in the company can see how they drive the success of our impact goals.Story continuesHow have you seen ESG evolve in the Investor Relations role?There has been a very large shift in how investors view ESG. The ‘E' and the ‘S' have become more paramount in investors' minds, and, as a result, we spend more time talking about these topics in our normal course conversations with both the sell side and the buy side. Our IR team spends significantly more time in ESG related work than we did just a couple of years ago - encompassing everything from message development and disclosures to investor engagement. In fact, later this year, our team will be taking on even more direct ESG/Impact reporting work as Etsy is moving data collection and disclosure ownership from our Sustainability team into the purview of our Finance team.Can you share your top ESG focus areas over the past 12-18 months? Are there specific metrics/KPIs you use to measure your success?We were the first e-commerce company and one of the first U.S. companies to use SASB metrics in an integrated manner in our 10K report. On the IR side, our team has a few goals that are focused on ESG.Ensuring that our disclosures respond to investor needsWe as an IR team are as knowledgeable about the Impact/ESG metrics as we are about financial and operational KPIsWe incorporate Impact/ESG messaging into our ongoing investor messaging and conversations.What advice do you have for issuers looking to tell their best ESG story?Having an ""ESG story"" to me really means how are you driving long-term value creation for all of your stakeholders. The corporate strategy must dictate the ESG story, and it can only be effectively communicated when it is one and the same.How have you sought to develop your ESG skill set, and how have you used us for support via our ESG Advisory engagement?Starting 2020, Etsy knew we have been ahead of the game with our Impact/ESG reporting. But we questioned - was it enough? In Q2 20, Etsy's IR team worked with Nasdaq to further understand where we fit in terms of best practices as evaluated specifically by the financial community - ultimately to ensure that, over time, these efforts further positively impact investor perceptions of Etsy and our market valuation.Specifically, Etsy engaged the ESG Advisory team at Nasdaq to conduct the following work:Understand materiality, ESG ratings, index criteria &amp; buy-side needsReview disclosures vs. peer benchmarkingHelp align corporate efforts to the ESG ecosystemBenchmark valuation, ratings and feedback to prioritize future effortsDevelop an appropriate E&amp;S focused investor outreach strategyWhat we learned:Etsy is consistently identified as ‘best in class' by investors representing $3T in AUM/20% of our shareholder base.1Etsy's reporting 10-K process is highlighted by most as a preferred method along with detailed sustainability reports.Etsy's investors endorse SASB and TCFD as reporting frameworksNasdaq reviewed the top ESG capital markets perspectives and created a ‘Venn diagram' of disclosure overlaps to reveal ways Etsy could potentially improve its ESG profile. We're focusing on improving the ease with which investors can find out information on topics such as data privacy/security, supplier information and labor management practices - areas where we have deep commitment and activity but are less clear in our disclosures or where our disclosures may be hard to find.Etsy is currently under-represented in some key ESG Index funds. While hard to predict and influence, a combination of continued improvements in disclosures WITH growth in our market capitalization should enable us to capture more of this passive money over time.What are the benefits you have seen from being a (Nasdaq) ESG Advisory client?As you can see from this detailed information on what we learned, we found the Nasdaq work to be very helpful AND actionable. Etsy is working to round out our investor relations website to include added information and will be making some additional changes to how we think about ESG as a result of this work.1Examples of Etsy's top impact rankings:Just100 - Ranked #52 out of 922 companies and 1st of 50 Retail companiesAwarded a Leadership-level score of A- from CDP in 2019Ranked #48 in Fast Company best places to work for innovatorsWinner of Fast Company's 2020 World Changing Ideas AwardsReceived a perfect score on the HRC Corporate Equality Index, relating the LGBTQ+ equality in the workplaceNasdaq, Inc., Monday, November 14, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/725521/Nasdaq-ESG-Trendsetters-Etsy]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Kings List by Yield: Top 10 Stocks. Dividend Kings are the stocks that have raised their dividends for at least 50 straight years or more. These companies endured periods of economic downturn better than their peers due to consistent cash flows and stable earnings. In times of financial volatility, investors focus on stocks that offer low risk with proven track records of dividend growth. Stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground in this context.Over the years, dividend growers have taken a significant place in investors’ portfolios. These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans. In an extended period of higher inflation, like the one we are confronted with today, dividend growth stocks provide a hedge against rising costs with stable income. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers reported an average annual return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return for non-dividend payers. During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%. This shows that dividend growth stocks offer an excellent way to generate passive income during inflationary periods.Dividend stocks have remained a significant component of total market returns in the past. In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks represented 8% of the total return in the first two years of this decade.Stephanie Link, a chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, spoke about dividend investments in her recent interview with Barron’s. She asserted that investors should focus on growing payouts instead of high dividends as dividend growth is of utmost importance in an inflationary environment. This report also highlighted that dividend shares in the S&amp;P 500 index reported an 11% decline this year as of October 29, compared with a 23% drop for non-dividend stocks. Further elaborating on dividend growth stocks, we will discuss top dividend kings in this article.Story continuesDividend Kings List by Yield: Top 25 StocksPhoto by buian_photos on Unsplash Our Methodology:The dividends stocks mentioned below belong to the group of Dividend Kings and have raised their payouts for 50 years or more.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

251,e239a67b-49df-3251-acb1-6a94bed6194f,URI,2022-11-15,United Rentals to Acquire Ahern Rentals for $2 Billion,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-acquire-ahern-rentals-110000348.html,1668423600,STORY,['URI'],"[Combination will add significant capacity of branches, fleet and expertise to serve customers in strategic U.S. geographiesSTAMFORD, Conn.STAMFORD, Conn., November 14, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) today announced that the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of family-owned Ahern Rentals, Inc. for approximately $2.0 billion in cash. The board of directors of United Rentals unanimously approved the agreement. The transaction is expected to close prior to year-end 2022, subject to customary conditions.Founded in 1953, Ahern Rentals is the eighth largest equipment rental company in North America, with approximately 2,100 employees and 106 locations in 30 states serving approximately 44,000 customers in the construction and industrial sectors. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2022, Ahern Rentals generated $310 million of adjusted EBITDA on $887 million of total revenue.Strong Strategic RationaleConsistent with United Rentals’ ""grow the core"" strategy, customers of both companies will be better served by the combined scale, and legacy customers of Ahern Rentals will benefit from one-stop access to United Rentals’ specialty rental offerings.Ahern Rentals’ customer service footprint of branches, fleet and experienced employees is complementary with United Rentals’ existing network. The combination will increase capacity for United Rentals in key geographies, with concentrations on both U.S. coasts and in the Gulf region.The combination will expand the fleet available to United Rentals customers by over 60,000 rental assets with an original cost of $1.85 billion, as well as approximately $145 million of non-rental fleet. Notably, over 75% of Ahern Rentals’ rental fleet is comprised of high-demand aerial and material handling equipment.The integration of the acquired branch and sales operations represents significant opportunities to improve efficiency, productivity and new business development with the adoption of United Rentals technology and field management processes. Ahern Rentals and United Rentals use a number of the same technology platforms, including the RentalMan ERP system.Story continuesStrong Financial RationaleThe purchase price of approximately $2.0 billion represents a multiple of 6.5x adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2022, or 4.5x adjusted EBITDA net of cost synergies and the net present value of tax attributes estimated at $426 million.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to United Rentals’ adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow generation in its first year post-close.The transaction is projected to result in a net leverage ratio at year-end 2022 at the low end of the company’s target range: 2.1x adjusted EBITDA as-reported, and 2.0x on a pro forma basis.Return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to exceed the cost of capital within 24 months of closing on a run-rate basis, with an attractive IRR and NPV. Importantly, the return profile of the transaction is compelling across a range of macro scenarios.The combination is expected to generate approximately $40 million of annualized cost synergies within the first 12 to 18 months of closing, primarily in the areas of corporate overhead, operations and cost of rentals due to efficiencies of scale. Additionally, United Rentals expects to realize procurement savings based on the combined spending of both companies.United Rentals expects to realize approximately $60 million of annual revenue synergies by year three, led by the cross-selling of its specialty rental offerings to an expanded customer base.The transaction is not conditioned on financing. United Rentals expects to use a combination of newly issued debt and existing capacity under its ABL facility to fund the transaction and related expenses.The company currently plans to pause its $1.25 billion share repurchase program through the initial phase of the integration, consistent with its approach during the integrations of similarly sized general rental transactions.CEO CommentsMatthew Flannery, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, ""Our acquisition of Ahern Rentals supports our strategy to deploy capital to grow the core business and drive shareholder value. We view ourselves as the ideal owner of these assets within our network, as customers will benefit from the combination of the two organizations moving forward together. We’re leveraging our competencies in larger-scale M&amp;A to augment both our near- and long-term earnings power.""Flannery continued, ""Our integration playbook is underway so we can prepare the acquired branches to take full advantage of our systems and operational capabilities, and gain from our employee and customer-centric culture. I look forward to welcoming our new team members upon the closing of the acquisition.""Don Ahern, chief executive officer of Ahern Rentals, said, ""I’m proud of what we’ve built at Ahern Rentals over nearly seven decades, and I’m extremely pleased that the combination with United Rentals will take the business forward in this next chapter of growth. I want to thank our employees for driving the results that make this transaction possible. This is a strong outcome for both organizations and our customers.""Key Statistics of the AcquisitionFinancial data in $ millionsPurchase Price$2,000Present Value of Acquired Tax Assets$426Total Revenues (LTM 9/30/22)$887Adjusted EBITDA (LTM 9/30/22)$310Estimated Annualized Cost Synergies Achieved in Year Two$40Estimated Annualized Cross-Selling Benefits Achieved by End of Year Three$60Original Equipment Cost of Acquired Rental Fleet$1,850Non-Rental Fleet$145Employees~2,100Rental Branches106Customers~44,000AdvisorSullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP acted as legal advisor to United Rentals.Presentation and Conference Call / WebcastA presentation about the transaction is available in the Investor Relations section of the United Rentals website.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +20.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has gained 12.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share, indicating a change of -3.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.59 billion and $52.91 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +6.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The combination of Micron DDR5 and AMD’s 4th Gen processor enhanced the performances of OpenFOAM, WRF and CP2K dynamics by 2.4x, 2.1x and 2.03x, respectively.Further, the Micron DDR5 memory attained a peak memory bandwidth of 378 GB/s per socket with AMD’s 4th Gen EPYC processors, higher than the 189 GB/s attained with AMD’s 3rd Gen EPYC processors. Thus, the memory offers two times higher bandwidth compared to prior generations of the processor systems on the STREAM benchmark.At maturity, DDR5 enables speeds of 8800 MT/s, delivering up to a 3x improvement in effective memory bandwidth compared to DDR4, which is required to feed the continued growth of central processing unit cores in the modern data center. Moreover, DDR5 brings new and increased densities with 24Gb components and even higher densities in the future.Micron DDR5 memory ensures increased reliability and scaling as it sports 16Gb and 24Gb densities today, up to 64Gb chip densities in the future, and will deliver 4x the memory density of DDR4.The combination of Micron’s DDR5 and AMD 4th Gen EPYC processors is likely to transform the data center operations of AMD enterprise customers while accelerating their time to value, reducing their total ownership costs and aiding to address their sustainability targets. DDR5 stands as a significant enhancement in the system memory capabilities that are required to enable increasingly memory-bound algorithms, which bodes well for the next generation of data center infrastructure.During fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Micron reported Dynamic random access memory revenues of $4.81 billion, which represented 72% of the total top line. The company continues to witness growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5th-generation cellular network adoptions. A rising mix of high-value solutions, 5th Gen adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are the company’s growth drivers.Shares of Micron and AMD have declined 18.6% and 50.6%, respectively, in the past year.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMicron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while AMD carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Computer and Technology sector are Celestica CLS and Fabrinet FN, each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Celestica’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has increased by 9 cents to 53 cents per share over the past 30 days.

He's referencing one of Hasbro's most popular trading card games, ""Magic the Gathering,"" which Haas estimates accounts for roughly 15% of the company's revenue. Haas says they are overproducing cards, which is, quote, ""destroying the long-term value of the brand.""Elsewhere in that toy sector, rival Mattel, just a few weeks ago, cut its guidance for 2022. Mattel down 1/3 in the last six months. Hasbro itself falling more than 9% today, and 43% year to date. Toy stocks in bad shape ahead of the holidays, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, that's really an example of too much of a good thing when it came to Hasbro. Perhaps they did a little too much-- they've diluted the brand. So a lot of people are like, it's too much. It's losing its worth. And in that same note, he said that Hasbro could fall 34% due to the company ruining the ""Magic the Gathering"" card game. So when you have one game responsible for that much, not a good sign. You have to be more diverse than that.DAVE BRIGGS: 15% of revenue and it's tough-- another softening indication of the economy.]"

It features First Lady Jill Biden, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh and U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. Additionally, there will be a roundtable on scaling and growing apprenticeships, which will include Secretary Walsh, White House officials and executives from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., McDonald's, United Airlines, Walgreens Boots Alliance and others. They will address the importance of apprenticeships and ways to continue to scale the apprenticeship model among more employers, giving even more people greater access to sustainable careers with paid training to be successful. An apprentice-moderated discussion and networking event will follow the roundtable. Apprenticeships are key to expanding the talent pipeline and helping companies create more inclusive workforces that embrace talented individuals who may not have earned four-year college degrees. Contributing to national efforts, the Chicago Apprentice Network, founded in 2017 by Accenture, Aon and Zurich North America, has grown to include more than 80 employers that have brought on nearly 1,500 apprentices in industries including finance, technology, consulting, retail and manufacturing. In 2022, Accenture, Aon and Zurich North America were named Apprenticeship Ambassadors by the Biden Administration's Department of Labor.""A firm's talent is its most valuable asset. To build a truly resilient workforce, firms can benefit by expanding their candidate pools and opening the doors to a broader, more diverse group of candidates,"" said Greg Case, chief executive officer, Aon.

""While those traditional opportunities remain, Zurich, Accenture, Aon and many other businesses have pushed out those guardrails and proven that apprenticeships work across a wide range of corporate settings and roles. In all cycles, in every industry, all of us need talent with innovative ideas and fresh perspectives, and our talent pools want and deserve opportunities to develop and reach their potential.

Dedicated to supporting the diverse range of local businesses that create jobs, help boost the economy, and enhance neighborhoods around the country, Small Business Saturday was created by American Express in 2010 in response to small business owners’ most pressing need: getting more customers. Learn more at and connect with us on ShopSmall.com, instagram.com/ShopSmall, facebook.com/SmallBusinessSaturdayABOUT SHOP SMALLShop Small is a year-round movement that supports small, independent businesses and calls attention to the valuable and distinct contributions they make to their communities and the economy. Shop Small celebrates small businesses ranging from retail stores and restaurants to fitness studios and salons, and everything in between. The Shop Small movement was spurred by the widespread participation in Small Business Saturday, a day founded in 2010 by American Express. This national holiday shopping tradition is dedicated to celebrating small businesses and driving more customers through their doors on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. November 26, 2022 marks the 13th annual Small Business Saturday, proudly backed by American Express. Learn more at and connect with us on ShopSmall.com, instagram.com/ShopSmall, https://facebook.com/SmallBusinessSaturdayABOUT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS SHOP SMALL IMPACT STUDYThe American Express Shop Small Impact Study consisted of two studies conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express. The consumer survey was an anonymous online survey conducted from September 26-28, 2022 among a sample of 1,008 adults 18 years of age and older. Consumer data is weighted by five variables: age, sex, geographic region, race and education to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the total U.S. population, 18 years of age and older based on U.S. Census data. The small business owner survey was conducted online among a sample of 506 small business owners/managers in the U.S. from September 26 – October 5, 2022. Respondent companies must conduct sales in a physical location in one of the following industries: arts/entertainment/recreation, retail trade, restaurant/bar/coffee shop/hotel/hospitality, or personal services.ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDYThe 2022 Small Business Economic Impact Study was conducted by Econsult Solutions, Inc. (ESI) on behalf of American Express. ESI calculated the share of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment and employee compensation that small businesses with under 100 employees provide to the economy based on an analysis used by the U.S. Small Business Administration. ESI also estimated how much of each dollar spent at the average small business remains in their local community, and used input-output analysis across 100 representative U.S. counties to calculate the additional impact that is generated locally as the result of the spending of employees and the spending of the small business with local suppliers and service providers.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis release includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.

That’s a strategy I, and many others, have taken.That said, I think there is also value in paring down Mr. Buffett’s portfolio into categories or sectors. This approach is one I think is worth considering, because it indicates directionally how Buffett is thinking about the market at a particular time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors will certainly want to note, for example, that Warren Buffett has been re-orientating his portfolio toward energy for the better part of the past two years. Buffett’s view appears to be that energy exposure is a great hedge against inflation and more geopolitical conflict. Additionally, many energy companies are excellent operators and produce incredible cash flows and dividends (which he’s historically preferred).Then there’s the tech sector, dominated by a company we’ll get to on this list. It’s important to have some component of high-quality growth in one’s portfolio, and there’s plenty to be found in Berkshire right now.Finally, directional exposure to the U.S. consumer makes sense for most long-term investors. Finding companies that continue to grow alongside the broader economy is a great way to grow one’s wealth.These three stocks are perhaps among the best in Buffett’s portfolio right now, representing excellent wealth-generating assets for long-term investors.OXYOccidental Petroleum$70.48AXPAmerican Express$154.75AAPLApple$146.87Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comHouston-based hydrocarbon exploration company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been among the biggest additions Warren Buffett has made over the past year. This move has proven to be prudent, given Occidental’s price performance increase of more than 130% this year. Notably, Buffett has been adding millions of shares for several quarters now, suggesting that he’s betting that the energy trade is far from over.Story continuesOf course, one of the primary reasons oil stocks have outperformed the market is the relatively high prices at which crude oil has been trading. There’s always some risk that oil prices will decline, if demand is hit hard enough by central banks. However, Warren Buffett appears to be sticking with this pick, and buying on weakness.Investors will hope for Occidental Petroleum to show strength as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $2.48, a 185.06% increase over the prior-year quarter. The most recent consensus forecast calls for quarterly revenue of $9.35 billion, a 37.25% increase over the previous year.Valuation is also important, so investors should be aware that Occidental Petroleum currently has a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.35 times. Occidental Petroleum ranks eighth in the Oil &amp; Gas-Exploration and Production industry group and seems to be an exciting buy option for investors right now. At least, Warren Buffett thinks so.American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has long been one of the most desirable brands in the market. This is why many consumers are willing to pay nearly $700 per year for the American Express Platinum card.American Express earns a decent living by charging these subscription fees on several card programs, such as its Platinum and Gold cards. Apart from the company’s credit card lending business, American Express also operates an end-to-end payments network that facilitates payment transactions between consumers and merchants. The revenue from these transactions is the company’s largest revenue generator.The New York City-based company expects full-year earnings to exceed its forecast of $9.25 to $9.65 per share. Analysts are already forecasting full-year earnings of around $9.92 per share.American Express maintains its full-year revenue growth forecast of 23% to 25%. This statement came after American Express reported higher revenue in the previous quarter. For those looking for long-term exposure to the American consumer, there’s perhaps no better way to go than AXP stock right now.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comNo list of Warren Buffett stocks is complete without discussing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the most valuable company in the world for much of the past decade. This is one of the Oracle of Omaha’s best bets in recent years, and it’s also his biggest holding (for good reason).In fact, Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple holdings increased in value by $9.8 billion during the first half of 2022. This was driven in part by a surge in Apple stock of nearly 7% following a strong earnings report. While the stock’s recent performance hasn’t been great (along with the entire market), this is a long-term winner for Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway began buying Apple stock in 2016 and now owns 887,136,000 shares of the iPhone maker. This is more than 5% of Apple’s outstanding stock.Apple pays out regular dividends, which Buffett considers appealing to his investing philosophy. Buffett has also argued that Apple’s iPhone ecosystem is “sticky”. This encourages customers to upgrade regularly, making it a safer investment as a consumer company rather than a tech company.Furthermore, Apple’s revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $90.1 billion in Q4 2022, with multiple segments outperforming Q4 2021. Its iPhone segment revenue of $42.63 billion surpassed the previous year’s $38.87 billion, while Mac revenue of $11.51 billion increased from $9.18 billion in Q4 2021. With several PC companies experiencing decreased demand, Apple’s 25% growth in its Mac segment demonstrates the potency of its products.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in BRK-B and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM.Industry: Building ProductsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017191/4-concrete-aggregates-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsRising raw material costs, housing market slowdown, supply-chain disruptions and higher labor and transportation costs are creating several hurdles for the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry players. Nonetheless, a boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to act as a major tailwind.Also, an improving non-residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Prominent names in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Eagle Materials Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes, Residential Slowdown, &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Story continuesAlso, the businesses are exposed to weather-related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.This apart, the recent slowdown in the residential market is causing a downdraft in wallboard, cement and other products of the industry, thereby weighing on the companies’ performance. Notably, rising mortgage rates and home prices have been prompting a moderation in housing demand.Focus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water.Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players also have been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a weak earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since October 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 have been revised 1.2% and 2.1% downward.Despite the industry’s gloomy near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to the portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively lost 22.8% versus the broader sector’s decline of 25.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 21.5% in the same period.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 16.2X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 16.6X and the sector’s 11.8X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.5X, as low as 13.5X and at a median of 19.4X.4 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Below, we have discussed four stocks from the industry that have solid earnings growth potential. The chosen companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Summit Materials has been witnessing solid pricing growth across all lines of business and expects the trend to continue in 2023. The company has also been optimizing its portfolio as it intends to shift toward a more materials-led portfolio.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic as it believes public markets are poised to experience robust and durable growth driven by well-funded state budgets and as infrastructure funding begins to flow through.

This Zacks Rank #3 company’s earnings estimates for 2023 are expected to grow 50.9%.Vulcan Materials Company: This Birmingham, AL-based company produces and supplies construction aggregates, asphalt mix as well as ready-mixed concrete. The company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing, and Logistics Innovation — should enhance price performance as well as operating efficiencies.Vulcan Materials has been generating higher earnings despite tepid revenues on the back of prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. Overall, improving private non-residential construction, solid infrastructure investment and favorable pricing dynamics have been driving growth.Vulcan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have dropped 13.3% over the past year. Earnings for 2023 are expected to grow 26.5%.Martin Marietta Materials: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment, along with recovering private non-residential markets and heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to support near-term shipment levels.

Earnings for 2023 are expected to rise 21.7%.Eagle Materials: This Dallas, TX-based company produces and supplies heavy construction materials, light building materials, and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States.

Higher pricing is adding to the positives.Eagle Materials currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has lost 21.5% in the past year. Its earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have moved 2.9% upward in the past 30 days.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +11.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 16.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +48%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16.7%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.94 points to a change of +289.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.24 indicates a change of -17.1% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OXY _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.22 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $37.63 billion and $34.5 billion estimates indicate +43% and -8.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $9.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +39.4%. EPS of $2.44 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.58%. The EPS surprise was -1.61%.Over the last four quarters, Occidental surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That’s a strategy I, and many others, have taken.That said, I think there is also value in paring down Mr. Buffett’s portfolio into categories or sectors. This approach is one I think is worth considering, because it indicates directionally how Buffett is thinking about the market at a particular time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors will certainly want to note, for example, that Warren Buffett has been re-orientating his portfolio toward energy for the better part of the past two years. Buffett’s view appears to be that energy exposure is a great hedge against inflation and more geopolitical conflict. Additionally, many energy companies are excellent operators and produce incredible cash flows and dividends (which he’s historically preferred).Then there’s the tech sector, dominated by a company we’ll get to on this list. It’s important to have some component of high-quality growth in one’s portfolio, and there’s plenty to be found in Berkshire right now.Finally, directional exposure to the U.S. consumer makes sense for most long-term investors. Finding companies that continue to grow alongside the broader economy is a great way to grow one’s wealth.These three stocks are perhaps among the best in Buffett’s portfolio right now, representing excellent wealth-generating assets for long-term investors.OXYOccidental Petroleum$70.48AXPAmerican Express$154.75AAPLApple$146.87Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comHouston-based hydrocarbon exploration company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been among the biggest additions Warren Buffett has made over the past year. This move has proven to be prudent, given Occidental’s price performance increase of more than 130% this year. Notably, Buffett has been adding millions of shares for several quarters now, suggesting that he’s betting that the energy trade is far from over.Story continuesOf course, one of the primary reasons oil stocks have outperformed the market is the relatively high prices at which crude oil has been trading. There’s always some risk that oil prices will decline, if demand is hit hard enough by central banks. However, Warren Buffett appears to be sticking with this pick, and buying on weakness.Investors will hope for Occidental Petroleum to show strength as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $2.48, a 185.06% increase over the prior-year quarter. The most recent consensus forecast calls for quarterly revenue of $9.35 billion, a 37.25% increase over the previous year.Valuation is also important, so investors should be aware that Occidental Petroleum currently has a forward price-earnings ratio of 10.35 times. Occidental Petroleum ranks eighth in the Oil &amp; Gas-Exploration and Production industry group and seems to be an exciting buy option for investors right now. At least, Warren Buffett thinks so.American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has long been one of the most desirable brands in the market. This is why many consumers are willing to pay nearly $700 per year for the American Express Platinum card.American Express earns a decent living by charging these subscription fees on several card programs, such as its Platinum and Gold cards. Apart from the company’s credit card lending business, American Express also operates an end-to-end payments network that facilitates payment transactions between consumers and merchants. The revenue from these transactions is the company’s largest revenue generator.The New York City-based company expects full-year earnings to exceed its forecast of $9.25 to $9.65 per share. Analysts are already forecasting full-year earnings of around $9.92 per share.American Express maintains its full-year revenue growth forecast of 23% to 25%. This statement came after American Express reported higher revenue in the previous quarter. For those looking for long-term exposure to the American consumer, there’s perhaps no better way to go than AXP stock right now.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comNo list of Warren Buffett stocks is complete without discussing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the most valuable company in the world for much of the past decade. This is one of the Oracle of Omaha’s best bets in recent years, and it’s also his biggest holding (for good reason).In fact, Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple holdings increased in value by $9.8 billion during the first half of 2022. This was driven in part by a surge in Apple stock of nearly 7% following a strong earnings report. While the stock’s recent performance hasn’t been great (along with the entire market), this is a long-term winner for Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway began buying Apple stock in 2016 and now owns 887,136,000 shares of the iPhone maker. This is more than 5% of Apple’s outstanding stock.Apple pays out regular dividends, which Buffett considers appealing to his investing philosophy. Buffett has also argued that Apple’s iPhone ecosystem is “sticky”. This encourages customers to upgrade regularly, making it a safer investment as a consumer company rather than a tech company.Furthermore, Apple’s revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $90.1 billion in Q4 2022, with multiple segments outperforming Q4 2021. Its iPhone segment revenue of $42.63 billion surpassed the previous year’s $38.87 billion, while Mac revenue of $11.51 billion increased from $9.18 billion in Q4 2021. With several PC companies experiencing decreased demand, Apple’s 25% growth in its Mac segment demonstrates the potency of its products.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a LONG position in BRK-B and AAPL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

299,c85a3c9a-19cb-3b77-8752-1b2690a0cff4,KO,2022-11-15,Is Trending Stock CocaCola Company The (KO) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-cocacola-company-ko-140002103.html,1668434402,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +11.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +11.4% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.53 indicates a change of +2.1% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $9.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $42.73 billion and $43.51 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +1.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.2%. EPS of $0.69 for the same period compares with $0.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.37%. The EPS surprise was +7.81%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Kings List by Yield: Top 10 Stocks. Dividend Kings are the stocks that have raised their dividends for at least 50 straight years or more. These companies endured periods of economic downturn better than their peers due to consistent cash flows and stable earnings. In times of financial volatility, investors focus on stocks that offer low risk with proven track records of dividend growth. Stocks like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are gaining ground in this context.Over the years, dividend growers have taken a significant place in investors’ portfolios. These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans. In an extended period of higher inflation, like the one we are confronted with today, dividend growth stocks provide a hedge against rising costs with stable income. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers reported an average annual return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return for non-dividend payers. During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%. This shows that dividend growth stocks offer an excellent way to generate passive income during inflationary periods.Dividend stocks have remained a significant component of total market returns in the past. In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen. The report also mentioned that dividend stocks represented 8% of the total return in the first two years of this decade.Stephanie Link, a chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors, spoke about dividend investments in her recent interview with Barron’s. She asserted that investors should focus on growing payouts instead of high dividends as dividend growth is of utmost importance in an inflationary environment. This report also highlighted that dividend shares in the S&amp;P 500 index reported an 11% decline this year as of October 29, compared with a 23% drop for non-dividend stocks. Further elaborating on dividend growth stocks, we will discuss top dividend kings in this article.Story continuesDividend Kings List by Yield: Top 25 StocksPhoto by buian_photos on Unsplash Our Methodology:The dividends stocks mentioned below belong to the group of Dividend Kings and have raised their payouts for 50 years or more.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

SUM.Industry: Building ProductsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2017191/4-concrete-aggregates-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsRising raw material costs, housing market slowdown, supply-chain disruptions and higher labor and transportation costs are creating several hurdles for the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry players. Nonetheless, a boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to act as a major tailwind.Also, an improving non-residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Prominent names in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Co., Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., Eagle Materials Inc. and Summit Materials, Inc., have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials like aggregates and concrete along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes, Residential Slowdown, &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results.Story continuesAlso, the businesses are exposed to weather-related risks that affect production schedules and hence profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may continue to bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.This apart, the recent slowdown in the residential market is causing a downdraft in wallboard, cement and other products of the industry, thereby weighing on the companies’ performance. Notably, rising mortgage rates and home prices have been prompting a moderation in housing demand.Focus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water.Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reducing car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players also have been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector.

These companies have outperformed other asset classes on various fronts due to their stable fundamentals and solid business plans.

According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend growers reported an average annual return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return for non-dividend payers. During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%.

In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

These stakes have a total value of over $28.3 billion.Aristotle Capital Management, LLC mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the global beverage business, was a leading contributor for the period. Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail. Although uncertainties surrounding cost pressures, lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts remain, we believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to successfully continue its transition toward a total beverage business.”11.

""Investors need to know how they can recover their investments in time.""Starved of Russian energy exports, Germany is plugging short-term gaps by providing more coal and nuclear power than planned under its long-term renewable energy rollout aimed at meeting climate targets and eventually securing independence from imports.GE and Frontier said this pre-occupation, along with attempts to cap sky-high prices for consumers and siphon off excess profits in the utility sector, were distracting policymakers.They need to provide clarity on funding for the likes of new grid batteries, pumped storage plants and other measures.O'Neill also emphasised the longevity of gas turbines.They are a conduit for natural gas but could in future be repurposed for low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels, he said.Berlin has said its decarbonisation strategy remains intact despite the uncertain economic and geopolitical backdrop.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Valero Energy (VLO) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this oil refiner is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Valero Energy is 4.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 919.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 293.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Valero Energy has an S/TA ratio of 2.82, which means that the company gets $2.82 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 2.36, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Valero Energy is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 53.3% this year versus the industry average of 52.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Valero Energy have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 6.5% over the past month.Bottom LineValero Energy has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Valero Energy well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

312,ce168d4a-f812-30a9-9fa7-cc2647c52afb,VLO,2022-11-15,Valero Energy (VLO) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-great-momentum-170005496.html,1668445205,STORY,['VLO'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Valero Energy (VLO), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if VLO is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil refiner holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor VLO, shares are up 4.07% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 2.23% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.39% compares favorably with the industry's 15.65% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Valero Energy have increased 13% over the past quarter, and have gained 74.93% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -4.79% and -12.75%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to VLO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. VLO is currently averaging 3,895,631 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with VLO.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost VLO's consensus estimate, increasing from $27.02 to $28.66 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that VLO is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Valero Energy on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Delek US Holdings (DK). DK is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Another notable valuation metric for DK is its P/B ratio of 1.75. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.99. DK's P/B has been as high as 3.12 and as low as 1.11, with a median of 1.45, over the past year.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. DK has a P/S ratio of 0.12. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Finally, we should also recognize that DK has a P/CF ratio of 4.24. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 5.18. Over the past 52 weeks, DK's P/CF has been as high as 106.01 and as low as 2.81, with a median of 15.26.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Valero Energy is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.61 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.10. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 5.30 and average PEG ratio of 0.48.VLO's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 57.89 and as low as 4.79, with a median of 10.70, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 12.91 and as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.78, all within the past year.Valero Energy also has a P/B ratio of 2.15 compared to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 1.99. Over the past year, its P/B ratio has been as high as 2.90, as low as 1.47, with a median of 1.89.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Delek US Holdings and Valero Energy's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that DK and VLO is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Valero Energy (VLO) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 17.4% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this oil refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. VLO meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 13% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for VLO is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.66. This indicates that the stock moves 66% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that VLO has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped VLO earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, VLO is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. VLO is currently trading at 0.30 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 30 cents for each dollar of sales.So, VLO appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to VLO, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are three of the biggest companies in the world that have all hit 52-week lows this month.With a recession looming and a bear market having taken hold this year, it’s not surprising that many stocks are hovering around 52-week lows. It is rare to see so many high quality stocks get beaten down to the degree they have in recent months however. The four most popular stocks among hedge funds have all touched 52-week lows since November 3, creating a great opportunity for investors to buy low on some of the most respected companies in the world.Scanning the market for stocks at 52-week lows is a time-honored tradition among value investors, who covet the opportunity to buy quality companies with long track records of success at discounted prices. In many cases, such companies are merely caught in cyclical lows, without any real change to their long-term fundamental outlook that justifies their shares trading at their lowest point in a year or more.There are several technical reasons why stocks at 52-week lows can make good short-term buys as well. As stocks reach new yearly lows, short sellers are more likely to have profited from their positions and will look to buy shares to cover them. Bargain hunters, like the aforementioned value investors, are also more likely to start buying shares when they cross the 52-week low threshold, which can provide them with an immediate, though potentially short-lived, boost.That doesn’t mean every stock at a 52-week low is necessarily poised for a rebound however, either in the short or long term, which is evidenced by multiple stocks on this list, which have fallen to 2+ year lows. If you had bought these stocks earlier this year expecting a rebound by this point, you’d be sorely disappointed, as they’ve continued to trend down amid the tough economic backdrop.Story continuesAs with any investment decision, investors need to ask themselves why these stocks are at 52-week lows and whether their long-term outlook has changed enough in the last year to justify those new lows. If that doesn’t appear to be the case, it could be that the stock was simply overvalued a year ago and has fallen back to a more realistic valuation, which has happened to quite a number of growth stocks this year.We’ll try to answer some of those burning questions in this article as we take a look at 10 of the best 52-Week Low Stocks to buy now.10 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now Image by Gerd Altmann from PixabayOur MethodologyThe following 52-week low stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

Another is medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW), whose shares touched a 52-week low on November 4, a week after the release of the company’s Q3 results.Edwards Lifesciences shares fell by 17.9% on October 28 after the company announced Q3 sales of $1.32 billion and pro forma EPS of $0.61, both of which represented slight misses compared to consensus estimates.

While this quarter represented a deceleration in revenue growth from earlier this year, much of that was due to hospital staffing shortages and the vagaries of global healthcare systems emerging from pandemic disruptions. The Company received FDA approval for its minimally invasive mitral valve repair system, PASCAL, and also presented compelling related clinical data, which should help support accelerating growth over the next few years. As for Edwards’ core TAVR system, there continues to be a (unfortunately) pent-up, untreated population suffering from severe aortic stenosis that will finally be able to find their way back into healthcare systems as labor market pressures ease.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

Coca-Cola continues to benefit from the refranchising of its bottling operations and realignment of incentives, catalysts we previously identified. These initiatives are demonstrating their strength in an inflationary and supply-chain-challenged environment. Additionally, the company has focused on evolving its customer engagement practices by leveraging digital and social medias for targeted campaigns, such as the design and launch of Coke Byte in the metaverse. Lastly, Coca-Cola has furthered its transformation into a total beverage company, as it debuted its new Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola ready-to-drink premixed cocktail.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Construction Stocks To Buy Now. Although consumer inflation decreased slightly in October, prices for services and rents are expected to rise, continuing the path of steep increases that have crushed the stock market in 2022. Apart from food and energy, core CPI is forecasted to have climbed by 0.5%, or 6.5% on an annual basis. This is less than the 0.6% jump in September, which represented an annual pace of 6.6%. The central bank has hinted that the future rate hikes will be smaller, although interest rates will continue to climb to rein in inflation.A slower-than-expected rate of inflation sparked a rally in bond prices, which trims their yield. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 4% to 3.86% on November 10. This also indicates some relief in mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate exceeded the 7% mark, touching 7.08% for the week ended November 10, as per Freddie Mac. The real estate sector on November 10 gained 6.7%, becoming the best-performing S&amp;P 500 segment. Firms like D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) were the most prominent beneficiaries of the real estate rally. Our Methodology We selected the following construction stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.Sophie McAulay/Shutterstock.comBest Construction Stocks To Buy Now12. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is an Ireland-based company that manufactures and distributes building materials. It operates through three segments – Americas Materials, Europe Materials, and Building Products. CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) commenced its share repurchase program in May 2018, and as of September 2022 it has returned $3.8 billion to shareholders under its ongoing share buyback plan. Story continuesOn September 13, JPMorgan analyst Elodie Rall maintained an Overweight rating on CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) but lowered the price target on the shares to EUR 50 from EUR 59. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 12 hedge funds were bullish on CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 9 funds in the prior quarter. Edgar Wachenheim’s Greenhaven Associates is the leading position holder in the company, with 752,445 shares worth $26.20 million. Like D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL), CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) is one of the best construction stocks to monitor. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“CRH plc (NYSE:CRH) was outlined in detail in our December 2021 Quarterly Report. Since then, the tragic war in Ukraine commenced with no signs of resolution. This war and associated sanctions on Russia have led to major disruptions to European energy markets. CRH is a relatively energy intensive business and around 20% of the Group’s operations are in Europe. We expect they will be negatively impacted by higher energy prices and reduced economic activity. Around 75% of CRH’s operations are in North America and will be less impacted compared to the European operations.We have followed and analyzed the global building products industry for nearly 25 years and the current share price of CRH presents an investment opportunity that rarely arises. CRH recently sold a business for US$3.8 billion, equating to almost 15x EBIT. In comparison, the remainder of CRH which consists of many businesses which are higher quality than the divested operation, is trading on around 9x EBIT, 11x PE, 9% free cash flow, 4% dividend yield and CRH is buying back around 3% of its shares annually. CRH has delivered shareholders a 15% return per annum, compounded over 50 years. The current share price provides compelling value for investors with a longer-term horizon.”11. Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) is a Colorado-based company that manufactures and sells construction materials and downstream products for the public infrastructure, residential, and non-residential end markets. On November 2, Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.73 and a revenue of $686.01 million, topping analysts’ estimates by $0.01 and $21.16 million, respectively. It is one of the best construction stocks to invest in. Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari on November 8 raised the price target on Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE:SUM) to $33 from $29 and reiterated a Buy recommendation on the shares following the in-line Q3 results.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, Summit Materials, Inc.

(NYSE:SUM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials-based company that supplies aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete, and asphalt in the United States and British Columbia. Fears of a potential economic slowdown and a corresponding cooling in construction activity weighed on the company’s shares in the quarter. However, Summit has made noteworthy strides in optimizing its business portfolio through the divestiture of underperforming assets, allowing it to drive margins higher through efficiency gains and accretive acquisitions. Summit also is the beneficiary of ongoing migration trends favoring construction activity in the exurban and rural markets it primarily serves.”10. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is a Georgia-based homebuilding company that acquires and develops land for residential purposes. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is one of the top construction stocks to invest in. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) was one of the most prominent winners of the real estate rally on November 10, with the stock gaining 13%. On October 26, BTIG analyst Carl Reichardt reaffirmed a Buy rating on PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) but lowered the price target on the shares to $50 from $52. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)’s Q3 earnings miss was caused by weak homebuilding revenue and a larger than forecasted unit order decline, the analyst told investors. 2023 will be a ""trough year"" for housing demand, but the analyst still expects a 21% return on equity for PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Harris Associates is the biggest position holder in PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) as of Q2 2022, with 4.8 million shares worth $191.6 million. Here is what Miller Value Partners specifically said about PulteGroup, Inc.

(NYSE:PHM), traded down to half their financial crisis lows despite reporting housing improvements for the first time. Fear ruled in the short term, but fundamentals ultimately prevailed. Homebuilders were top performers in 2012 posting triple-digit increases in some cases. Opportunity Equity was a top performer that year.”9. Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO) is an Arizona-based company that designs, constructs, and sells manufactured homes in the United States. The company markets its manufactured homes under the Cavco, Fleetwood, Palm Harbor, Nationwide, Fairmont, Friendship, Chariot Eagle, Destiny, Commodore, Colony, Pennwest, R-Anell, Manorwood, and MidCountry brands.

Richard Scott Greeder’s Broad Bay Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 268,000 shares worth $52.5 million. 8. Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) is a Texas-based company that produces and supplies heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States. It operates through Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, and Recycled Paperboard segments. On November 8, Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on January 12, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 16. On October 10, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari maintained a Buy rating on Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $136 from $146. The analyst slashed estimates in North America building products ahead of the Q3 earnings season and prefers aggregates producers as he forecasts high public construction to widely offset slow residential demand.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 22 hedge funds were bullish on Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 28 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 183,884 shares worth $20.2 million. Here is what L1 Capital International specifically said about Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The investment thesis for Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE:EXP) was featured in our December 2020 Quarterly Report. Since then, the business has met our expectations. Eagle Materials is a low-cost regional producer of cement and wallboard. The U.S. cement industry is sold out, with imports required to meet demand levels. Eagle Materials operates in the centre of the U.S. where imports from the coast are prohibitively expensive. These sold-out conditions are before an expected increase in demand in 2023 and beyond as the U.S. implements its US$1 trillion infrastructure spending program.Eagle Materials’ wallboard operations also have a cost advantage over its competitors, predominantly using natural gypsum located next to its manufacturing facilities, rather than relying on more expensive synthetic gypsum derived from the waste generated by coal power plants or imported natural gypsum.Both the cement and gypsum industry have increased prices to offset cost inflation (see Figure 11). Eagle Materials has benefitted from these price increases and expanded margins due to its low-cost position in the industry. While we expect some softening in the wallboard industry due to reduced new residential construction, we consider Eagle Materials is currently materially undervalued, trading on 11x EV/EBIT, 12x PE and a 10% free cash flow yield.”7. M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) was founded in 1976 and is based in Columbus, Ohio.

Shareholders' equity reached a record high of $1.9 billion, a 25% increase from a year ago, with book value per share of $71. The return on equity came in at 27%. M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) is one of the premier construction stocks to buy now. Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless on October 27 reiterated an Outperform rating on M/I Homes, Inc. (NYSE:MHO) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $63 from $83 following the Q3 results. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 23 hedge funds were long M/I Homes, Inc.

Clint Carlson’s Carlson Capital is a prominent shareholder of the company, with 285,693 shares worth $11.3 million. 6.

While Q3 results were resilient, the only metric that mattered to him was the significant sequential decline in backlog, the analyst argued.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 27 hedge funds were bullish on Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE:SKY), compared to 35 funds in the last quarter. Michael Kaufman’s MAK Capital One is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3 million shares worth $142.2 million. In addition to D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL), elite hedge funds are piling into Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE:SKY) for exposure to the construction industry. Here is what Wasatch Small Cap Value Fund has to say about Skyline Champion Corporation (NYSE:SKY) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Manufactured-housing producer Skyline Champion Corp. (SKY) also helped the Fund’s results. Skyline has executed well and has benefited from simplification of its product line. Broader industry trends, such as rising housing demand and improved financing for lower-income buyers, were additional tailwinds for Skyline’s stock.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Construction Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:13 Best American Stocks To Buy10 Most Shorted Oil StocksBest Consistent Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Construction Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But not Jonas Cutler.Cutler joined the Marine Corps in 1989 and was determined to make the most of the four-year enlistment. During his off-duty hours, he traveled, learned to scuba dive, and started his college education. He gained rank and responsibility, too, eventually becoming a non-commissioned officer.That mindset-take advantage of all your opportunities-has been a guiding force in Cutler's life. It's taken him from the Marines to law school to his current position with the contracts team at Principal®. The skills he learned in the military helped him successfully transition to civilian life and enabled him to help other veterans see opportunities after their own discharge.A reset and a way forwardBorn in Des Moines, Iowa, Cutler and his mom moved around the Midwest after his parents divorced. He didn't have the money to go to college and his school experience had been disjointed. ""My parents were hippies, and how do you rebel against hippies? You cut off your hair and join the Marine Corps,"" Cutler says with a smile. ""My opportunities outside the military were limited. It was a chance to reset.""After enlisting, Cutler headed to San Diego for boot camp, which was located next to the airport; private planes taking off provided the soundtrack to predawn drills. Next came both infantry and combat engineer schools before Cutler shipped out. He was based in Okinawa for two years, deploying around the region, including six months in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for the Gulf War. There, he cleared lanes in minefields and other barriers to engage Iraqi units. His honorable discharge came four years to the day from his enlistment date.Transitioning to civilian lifeSome veterans face difficulties when they leave military life and re-enter civilian life. They may be more reluctant to seek care for mental health challenges, for example.1 Over one-third face underemployment,2 and businesses sometimes struggle to match military training and combat skills to jobs in the private sector.Story continues""Think of it like a language and cultural barrier,"" Cutler says. There are communication styles and processes that may be unfamiliar to those in civilian life, and vice versa for those coming out of the military.But Cutler sees similarities and used that approach in his own transition. ""In the Marines, we collect information, evaluate opportunities, and make strategic decisions,"" he says. ""As empowered employees, we do that, too. We use our skill sets to produce something bigger and better.""Post-discharge, Cutler finished his degree at the University of Minnesota, worked at the Veterans Administration, and then decided to attend law school. By graduation, he was married and a father and worked for several years for the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation. ""I loved the mountains and ocean,"" Cutler says. ""But the work became more demanding, the cases were contentious, and it became difficult to see a trajectory.""Through a friend, he reached out to Principal and found a position with compliance. ""Everyone said it was a good place to go,"" he says.That was March 2008.‘The company is very good for us.'In 2008, of course, the economy collapsed; the real estate market stalled, and layoffs soared across sectors and employers, including Principal. Cutler's family stayed put in New Hampshire, unable to sell their house, and for more than a year, he flew back when he could. ""The company was able to keep me on, and for that I'm exceptionally grateful,"" he says.And he never lost the ability to see the opportunities ahead of him and to help fellow veterans, too. Take a 2021 project he spearheaded with Principal colleague Micah Greene. The pair saw a gap in technology accessibility within the veteran community. If you're a veteran lacking tech, you probably also lack access to services and employment or educational opportunities.That led to the donation, sponsored by both Principal and the Principal® Foundation, of gently used, fully operational laptops at no charge to more than 100 veterans in the Des Moines metro area. The event also included free haircuts and free food (from two veteran-owned food trucks) for all in attendance, as well as job booths from several area employers.For Cutler, it was yet another example of Principal putting its commitment to veterans into action. ""I remember during the economic crisis in 2009, we had a scaled-back Veterans Day event, but the company still put time and effort into it,"" he says. ""I emailed [former Principal CEO] Larry Zimpleman to say thanks, and he replied personally. That's the nature of the company we work for: Recognizing good work and talent is in our DNA.""It's a message he conveys to other veterans. ""I enjoy it here, and I'm proud to work here,"" Cutler says. ""I talk to other combat vets often and encourage them to take a look. The company is very good for us.""One day a few years back, Cutler flew on the corporate jet to California for work. During the early-morning takeoff, he saw service members doing their predawn pushups, just like he did all those years ago. ""I thought, I did pretty good,"" he says.Interested in a career with a diverse, inclusive team that provides rewards and value?

However, a new U.S.-focused analysis of the Index, sponsored by Principal Financial Group® and conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), reveals an opportunity for employers to provide greater financial inclusion and support for their employees.The Index ranks 42 global markets on three pillars of financial inclusion – government, financial system, and employer support – using data across public and survey-based sources. The analysis ranked the U.S. first out of the 42 markets in the financial system pillar and second within the employer support pillar, driven largely by its enablement of small and medium enterprise (SME) growth and success.""U.S. employers are critical in helping their employees access the resources necessary to make well-informed financial decisions,"" said Chris Littlefield, president of Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal®. ""We must recognize and appreciate the role employers play in fostering financial inclusion within our communities and, as an industry, continue to do everything we can to help more businesses support the financial needs of their employees, now and into the future.""Opportunity for more consistent employer support across industriesWhen analyzing U.S. employer data by industry, opportunities were identified to enable more access to financial resources such as guidance, insurance benefits, retirement contributions, and pay initiatives (i.e. method of payment, access to interest-free loans on salary, etc.).Across six broad industry classifications within the U.S., professional sectors with typically higher wages (i.e. finance, insurance, real estate, and information management) were found to provide employees with more consistent support and tools to enable financial inclusion. This can generally be compared to industries such as retail and hospitality that often employ more informal workers and tend to have lower wages.Story continues""The importance of this analysis is the insight it offers employers to know where they stand in comparison to their industry and to consider how they can best support their employees with access to savings, financial education, and financial well-being programs,"" Littlefield said. ""We’re focused on helping employers become more intentional with solutions to meet the needs of their employees, including underserved individuals and part-time workers, while also advocating for the use of auto features in plans to increase participation and contribution rates.""Broad U.S. Industry ClassificationEmployersupportscore1Provision ofguidanceand support2Employeepension/retirementcontributions3Employeeinsuranceschemes4Employerpayinitiatives5Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate Services83.395.099.959.761.8Information Management Services81.487.087.167.178.5Construction65.590.936.789.074.2Production – Inclusive of Agriculture, Manufacturing, Mining &amp; Forestry, and Utilities56.459.657.969.537.1Health and Education Services28.945.626.836.68.6Other Services – Inclusive of Leisure &amp; Hospitality, Management, Personal Services, Professional/Scientific/Technical Services, Retail Trade, Transportation, and Wholesale Trade8.10.013.94.88.1Table 1: Employer support scores in the U.S. by sector from the 2022 Global Financial Inclusion IndexU.S. employers’ support of financial inclusion is often associated with sizeThe Index uncovers a clear association between business size and the financial support employers provide to their employees. Specifically, large businesses score considerably higher than small businesses on the level of support they offer to the workforce via financial guidance, insurance, pension contributions, and pay initiatives, for example.There are various reasons why large businesses can provide greater support than small businesses, who may lack dedicated resources and tend to overestimate the cost of benefits6. Small businesses could benefit from additional support in offering these solutions to their employees, whether from the government or through the financial services system at large.""There’s a need to better equip small businesses with the right information and tools to enable greater financial security for their employees,"" said Amy Friedrich, president of U.S. Insurance Solutions at Principal. ""These businesses fight hard for top talent, and to retain that talent, have realized the importance of providing holistic benefits offerings. With greater education around benefits costs and the variety of offerings that exist, many are realizing they don’t always have to cut benefits to reduce budgets7.""Employer SizeEmployersupportscoreProvision ofguidanceand supportEmployeepension/retirementcontributionsEmployeeinsuranceschemesEmployerpayinitiativesMore than 1000 employees90.898.687.290.790.3501–1000 employees86.596.882.982.088.0101–500 employees70.484.249.990.178.011–100 employees65.464.481.558.341.12–10 employees4.00.09.90.00.0Table 2: Employer support scores in the U.S. by business size from the 2022 Global Financial Inclusion IndexU.S. employers are critical drivers of financial inclusionDespite inconsistencies, when compared to other markets in the Index, the U.S. generally earns high marks across the four underlying indicators measured within the employer pillar – providing employees guidance and support around retirement contributions (first overall), pay (fourth overall), insurance protection (fifth overall), and financial issues (sixth overall). These support pillars help increase employee access to the solutions they need to enable long-term financial security.""As an organization with thousands of small to midsized businesses, we're focused on how we can further support employers with relevant financial education as well as meaningful tools and solutions to make a difference in the financial lives and futures of employees,"" said Friedrich.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, EnerSys has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Eaton has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ENS has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.ENS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.27, while ETN has a forward P/E of 21.38. We also note that ENS has a PEG ratio of 1.63. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ETN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94.Another notable valuation metric for ENS is its P/B ratio of 2.23. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ETN has a P/B of 3.99.Based on these metrics and many more, ENS holds a Value grade of B, while ETN has a Value grade of C.ENS sticks out from ETN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ENS is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AFL.Insurance Behemoth Soars Amid Renewed Market StrengthA glimmer of hope was cast upon the stock market last week, as lower-than-expected inflation data from October ignited the largest weekly rally since March. With many stocks beginning to show strength, investors may be wondering if the momentum can continue. Stocks that held up well this year illustrated their immunity to the volatility, and in past bear markets we’ve often seen these stocks continue their bullish runs as the market turns the corner.It remains to be seen if this recent move is actually the bottom or just another bear market rally. Certainly, investors applauded the mild CPI print, but lingering macroeconomic headwinds remain. And while the market is a forward-looking mechanism – typically bottoming well before relevant economic data – we may not be out of the woods just yet.So as tempting as it may be to pull the trigger on those beaten down technology stocks, the more prudent approach is to stick with the current leaders until we have more evidence in hand that growth names can put together a sustained rally.Despite a very difficult year for most stocks, we’ve seen pockets of strength in several different sectors such as insurance. These pockets have illustrated resilience, and rather than succumb to higher inflation, they’ve actually benefited from higher prices.The Zacks Insurance – Accident and Health industry group is ranked in the top 7% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Quantitative research studies have shown that roughly half of a stock’s price appreciation can be attributed to its industry group.

During the same period, dividend cutters and eliminators fell by 0.46%.

In the 1970s, dividend income accounted for 72% of the total returns, as reported by a Chicago-based financial planning company Nuveen.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)17.

A decision from the European Commission on the label extension is expected in the coming months.The recommendation is based on the phase III study FIREFLEYE and data from the follow-up study FIREFLEYE NEXT. Results from the FIREFLEYE study showed that treatment success with aflibercept 0.4 mg was high and achieved with mostly a single injection per eye in premature babies with severe retinopathy of prematurity.Aflibercept’s 2 mg solution injection is approved under the brand name Eylea for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or central RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME) and myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV).Bayer will apply for a six-month patent term extension for the European patent covering aflibercept, the active ingredient in Eylea, once the European Commission decides on the label extension of Eylea. A potential extension would prolong the patent term until November 2025.We note that Bayer has a collaboration agreement with Regeneron REGN for the global development of aflibercept. While Regeneron owns exclusive rights to Eylea in the United States, Bayer has licensed exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equal profits from the sales of Eylea.Eylea’s intravitreal injection 40 mg/mL has been approved for the treatment of preterm infants with ROP in Japan since September 2022.Additional label extensions will further increase the growth potential of this leading ophthalmology drug.Story continuesShares of Bayer have declined 1.7% in the year so far against the industry’s growth of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHigher sales of the ophthalmology drug Eylea boosted Bayer’s Pharmaceuticals segment in the third quarter, along with the sales of the newly launched cancer drug Nubeqa.Last month, Regeneron announced that the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity for Eylea injection, extending the period of U.S. market exclusivity for the drug by an additional six months through May 17, 2024.The pediatric exclusivity determination was based on data from two phase 3 trials – BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE – which were submitted in response to the FDA's Written Request to evaluate the use of Eylea as a treatment for ROP in preterm infants.Bayer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

If approved in Europe, Dupixent became the first-and-only treatment to be approved for prurigo nodularis in the country. The CHMP’s recommendation was based on data from two phase III studies, PRIME and PRIME2, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Data from the studies showed that Dupixent significantly improved itch, skin lesions and health-related quality of life in adults with prurigo nodularis.In Europe, Dupixent is presently approved to treat atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).The FDA approved Dupixent for prurigo nodularis in September. Prurigo nodularis was the fifth FDA-approved disease indication for Dupixent in the United States. Dupixent is now approved in the United States for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe CRSwNP, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Sanofi stock has risen 14.6% this year so far compared with the industry’s increase of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Dupixent is being jointly marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of the drug.Dupixent sales are now annualizing at close to €9.0 billion in sales after around five years on the market. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in peak sales. The drug’s frequent label expansion approvals are driving the drug’s sales higher. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications and expansion in younger patient populations expected, its sales are expected to be higher.Story continuesDupixent has become the key driver of the top line for Sanofi. Dupixent generated global product sales of $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which were recorded by Sanofi.Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in late-stage studies in a broad range of diseases, driven by type II inflammation like bullous pemphigoid, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Sanofi currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

GPS is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2022 numbers on Nov 17. The company is likely to register declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter bottom line is pegged at 1 cent per share, suggesting a sharp decline of 96.3% from 27 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.8 billion, indicating a 3.6% decline from that reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, Gap’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 300%. The company has reported an earnings surprise of 10.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteGap’s fiscal third-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of the changing consumer preference from casual wear to dressier clothes, as well as higher inventory, a tough macroeconomic environment and elevated costs. The company has been witnessing industry-wide challenges and headwinds in its Old Navy brand, including issues related to the launch of BODEQUALITY. Also, lower-than-anticipated demand in key categories like active, fleece, and kids and baby are likely to have dented the fiscal third-quarter performance.The company has been witnessing higher air freight costs. Huge discounts at Old Navy and rising commodity price increases are expected to have acted as other deterrents. Also, high inventory levels due to longer transit times, more delays, pack-and-hold strategies, and elevated AUC and input costs have been headwinds.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management noted that the company entered the fiscal third quarter with higher inventory. This is likely to have weighed on the fiscal third-quarter performance.However, management remained optimistic about sales in the second half of fiscal 2022. It anticipated air freight costs to decline in the second half of fiscal 2022, suggesting improved costs for the fiscal third quarter. The bottom line in the fiscal third quarter is expected to have gained from the sale of its UK distribution center.Gap has long been gaining from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. Strength in women’s active and wellness category, along with an increased focus on performance active as well as active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.Strength in Banana Republic has also been a key driver in recent quarters. The company’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from the easing of fuel prices, which is likely to have led to higher discretionary spending.Gap has been on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, focusing on store fleet optimization. The company’s efforts to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations, are likely to have aided sales in the fiscal third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gap this season.

QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Cisco prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q1 ResultsCisco’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to benefit from easing supply chain constraints. The company’s extensive product portfolio and the varied end-user base are also expected to have positively contributed to its top-line growth.Moreover, price hikes are expected to have somewhat offset inflation, thereby driving fiscal first-quarter top-line growth.Cisco’s revenues are likely to have benefited from momentum in web-scale, servers, wireless, security and SD-WAN businesses. The company has been benefiting from ongoing investments that its customers are making to rapidly digitize their organizations.Higher bandwidth requirements by customers are expected to have driven demand for Acacia’s optical solutions in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, the fiscal first-quarter results are expected to reflect the lingering effects of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as the negative impact of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Additionally, challenging macroeconomic conditions and the strong U.S. dollar have been major concerns.What Our Model SaysPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

CSCO may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cisco Systems is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CSCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 85 cents per share for CSCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CSCO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.46% heading into earnings season.Cisco Systems, Inc.
