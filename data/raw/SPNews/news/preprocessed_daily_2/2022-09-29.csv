Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) estimates that on an annual average basis, catastrophes around the world are expected to cause about $123 billion in insured losses compared to an average of $74 billion in actual losses over the past 10 years. This risk profile is assessed using Verisk’s global suite of models, which generate an industry exceedance probability (EP) curve that helps put years with high insured losses – like 2011 and 2017 - into context.“The most significant factor driving increased catastrophe losses over the past few years is the rise in exposure values and replacement costs,” said Bill Churney, president of Verisk Extreme Event Solutions. “Both are represented by continued construction in high-hazard areas as well as high levels of inflation that are driving up repair and rebuild costs. For this reason, it’s important for insurers to regularly reassess their exposures, particularly in the most vulnerable urban and coastal areas. Updating the property replacement values used in catastrophe modeling and other processes helps to ensure a more informed view of risk.”It is also important to consider the uncertainty and natural variability associated with global catastrophe losses. The current 5-year actual loss period has immediately followed a 10-year period of lower levels of loss highlighted by fewer loss-causing hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. Far larger years of insured losses can and will likely occur in today’s climatic conditions, and while climate change is contributing to increased catastrophe losses, it is to a lesser degree than the growth in the number and value of exposed properties.Story continuesVerisk’s models estimate a more than 40% chance of experiencing a 5-year average loss in excess of $100B, meaning the last 5 years should not be viewed as out of the ordinary. Also, Verisk’s models show at least a 50% chance of experiencing a single year in the next decade with insured losses in excess of $200B.“All catastrophes can contribute to losses, whether they are a single major event, an aggregation of smaller ones, or a combination of the two. As demonstrated by this report, Verisk models are effectively capturing the scale of recent losses, but also indicate that years of more extreme losses are possible,” said Dr. Jayanta Guin, executive vice president and chief research officer of Verisk Extreme Event Solutions. “We continue to invest in catastrophe models that provide a global and comprehensive view of the complex nature of risk today and of the near-present climate.”The 2022 edition of the Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses report bases its global loss metrics on Verisk’s latest suite of catastrophe models, including updates released during 2022 and updated industry exposure databases (IEDs) around the world.Download the 2022 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses report here: https://bit.ly/GlobalEP2022About Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk Extreme event solutions at Verisk (AIR Worldwide) provides risk modeling solutions that help individuals, businesses, and society become more resilient to extreme events.

Thereafter, a two-month long impressive summer rally raised optimism among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed’s tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Threats of a RecessionAs the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar, – the British has pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low, the euro is at a 20-year low and the Chinese yuan has fallen to its 14-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Economists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 27, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.88%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Stocks in FocusAt this juncture, dividend-paying stocks will be in huge demand to safeguard one’s portfolio.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusAlexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -38.14% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.18 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.42%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 4.39%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.85%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.72 is up 5.4% from last year. Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.41%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 58%, meaning it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for ARE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $8.42 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.51% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is possible as Modern Life’s technology utilizes data and analytics to speed up risk assessment and quoting.Modern Life seems the apt partner for assisting LNC in helping out financial professionals to grow their business prospects. Business growth is achievable only if a financial specialist eases the life insurance purchase process for its clients. Notably, Modern Life’s integrated dashboard precisely minimizes the friction points for financial professionals.The credible brokerage capability of Modern Life extends individualized assistance to overcome headwinds encountered by the professionals from intricate underwriting solutions, enhanced case design or sales concepts.The recent collaboration is expected to bolster Lincoln National’s distribution reach, ramp up its virtual-first distribution strategy and offer greater transparency for financial professionals availing the product suite. This concept of taking the help of a digital platform to highlight one’s products seems a time opportune move on the part of Lincoln National. The reason can be attributed to the ongoing digitization in every sphere of life, with the life insurance industry being no exception to the trend. Technology continues to play a vital role in keeping financial professionals and their clients connected to each other.The COVID-19 pandemic redefined the steps of a life insurance policy purchase and replaced face-to-face conversations with video calls. Digital forms emerged in place of paper applications, while in-person medical exams were taken over by predictive underwriting models. Thus, there is a dire need for injecting digitization into the system to ensure uninterrupted virtual communication among all parties involved, including wholesalers, financial professionals and end consumers, in an insurance buying process.Story continuesAlso, Lincoln National shows prudence in making an effort to boost sales of its life insurance products via this latest alliance, since the products usually follow a seasonal pattern of strong sales in the second half of the year.Shares of Lincoln National have lost 36.1% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 22.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksLincoln National currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Dillard's Inc. DDS, United Rentals Inc. URI and Unum Group UNM.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Value Stocks to Buy for Safety Amid Fed-Led Market RuckusSeptember is historically known as the toughest month on Wall Street. This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock's valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Dillard's Inc., United Rentals Inc. and Unum Group.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large  The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Story continuesInvestors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Avis Budget Group provides car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. The ability of CAR to cater to a wide range of mobility demands helps it to expand and strengthen its global foothold through organic growth.Avis Budget Group operates through distinct global brands that focus on different market segments and complement other brands in their respective regional markets. Fleet expansion and technology enhancement efforts by CAR are likely to enhance its offerings. The forward P/E of Avis Budget Group for the current financial year is 3.4X, lower than the industry average of 14.8X. CAR has a PEG ratio of 0.2, lower than the industry average of 1.3. Avis Budget Group has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.The forward P/E of Marathon Petroleum for the current financial year is 4.7X, lower than the industry average of 6.2X. MPC has a PEG ratio of 0.3, lower than the industry average of 0.5. Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last 7 days.United Rentals is benefiting from the U.S. administration's increased focus on infrastructural improvement. URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided United Rentals' second-quarter 2022 results. During the period, rental revenues grew 26.2% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin expanded 360 basis points.The forward P/E of United Rentals for the current financial year is 9.2X, lower than the industry average of 12X. URI has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 1.0. United Rentals has an expected earnings growth rate of 43.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 6.8% over the last 60 days.Unum Group's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. The sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistence levels in core business lines and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience.Continued rollout of dental products and geographic expansion have been paying off for UNM as its acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders' value. Unum Group expects 2022 premiums to grow about 2%. Adjusted operating EPS is expected to grow 15-20%.The forward P/E of Unum Group for the current financial year is 6.3X, lower than the industry average of 14.5X. UNM has a PEG ratio of 0.8 lower than the industry average of 1.4. Unum Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 7 days.Dillard's operates retail department stores in the southeast, southwest and Midwest areas of the United States. Its stores offer merchandise, including fashion apparel for women, men, and children as well as accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings, and other consumer goods.Dillard's has been keen on inventory management since the start of the pandemic, through measures like cancellation, suspension and delaying of shipments as well as merchandise purchase reduction. These aggressive measures to lower excess inventory owing to the pandemic-led decline in demand have proven beneficial to the company's margins.The forward P/E of Dillard's for the current financial year is 7.4X, lower than the industry average of 7.7X. DDS has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 0.7.

This makes the dividend yield 4.0%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.State Street has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 31%, which means that State Street would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 30.0% over the next 3 years. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 32% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.We Could See State Street's Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. State Street has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.6% per annum. State Street definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.State Street Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 6.47% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.93% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Thermo Fisher Scientific as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Thermo Fisher Scientific is projected to report earnings of $4.76 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 17.36%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.86 billion, up 5.67% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $22.94 per share and revenue of $43.16 billion. These totals would mark changes of -8.71% and +10.07%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

20,4775bb47-91af-335b-8f7e-222a12122434,USB,2022-09-29,"In the wake of U.S. Bancorp's (NYSE:USB) latest US$3.7b market cap drop, institutional owners may be forced to take severe actions",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wake-u-bancorps-nyse-usb-120024920.html,1664452824,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 68% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 5.7% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 29% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in U.S. Bancorp's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$113m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Pardon the interruption Mr. Adler, we're unable to hear you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul F. Adler, Cintas Corporation - VP of IR &amp; Treasurer [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. Yes, we were still on mute. So thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to our fiscal year 2023. First quarter total revenue grew 14.2%. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding a onetime gain recorded in last year's first quarter selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 20 basis points, and EPS grew 12.3%. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. In challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the work day. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Turning now to our business units. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.70 billion compared to $1.51 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 12.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers, volume versus price, is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $234.2 million compared to $199.1 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.8%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, declined again on a sequential basis. We welcome this mix shift because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream that has higher profit margins in PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $234.5 million compared to $189.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.4%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 44.1%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $11.90 to $12.30 to a range of $12.30 to $12.65. Mike? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 first quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 13.9%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.03 billion compared to $902.8 million last year, an increase of 13.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.5% for the first quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 47.6% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind, increasing 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.5% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 49.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services and 37.3% for Uniform Direct sale. Operating income of $440.1 million compared to $394.1 million last year. Excluding last year's first quarter gain totaling $12.1 million and recorded in selling and administrative expenses, fiscal '23 first quarter operating income increased 15.2% and operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 20.3% from 20.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.8% compared to 11% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter was $351.7 million compared to $331.2 million last year. Last year's first quarter diluted EPS contained $0.09 from the previously mentioned gain and related income tax expense. Excluding the gain and the related income tax expense, this year's diluted EPS of $3.39 compared to $3.02 last year, an increase of 12.3%. First quarter operating cash flow increased 13.8%. On June 15, 2022, we paid shareholders $97.7 million in quarterly dividends. Also during the quarter, we purchased $210.8 million of Cintas' common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '22 included not only the gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter, but also a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion, compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal '23 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal '23 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks, and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic-related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul F. Adler, Cintas Corporation - VP of IR &amp; Treasurer [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just 1 question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashish Sabadra, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was wondering if you could just comment on the new business trend, specifically around signing up new customers. Have you seen any changes there? And any signs of elongation of sales cycle, particularly for larger customers? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashish, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yes, our new business is quite robust. We continue to be very successful in converting over no programmers into our programs in all of our businesses with the exception of Fire, which obviously they're all -- everyone's a programmer in that business. But we're having really good success there. And we look at the total addressable market, and it's still incredibly large and growing. So that's exciting for us. But as far as the sales cycle, I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe that the sales cycle is elongating. We've got really good momentum in our new business. I'm very encouraged by that. And as we've spoken about in the past, some of our investments that we have made are really paying off big in the form of some of our unique products in our rental line with our Carhartt products, our Chef Works and we've got a CareFlex line of scrubs through Landau that's really successful in our restroom -- unique restroom lines. And then our First Aid business, just the breadth of products that we're offering is really helping us get in the door and provide great products and services to our customers. We're also seeing our investments in technology that we've made, whether it's our garment tracking that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace, our garment dispensing that we've seen. And I've spoken about our MyCintas portal, which is unique and an advantage in the marketplace. It makes it easier to do business with us, and that's important for our customers and gives our sales partners confidence in walking in the door. So some really good things in -- heading in that direction. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashish Sabadra, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's very helpful color. And obviously, great to see that strong momentum in the top line. Maybe just on the margins. The question around energy, it looks like oil prices might be rolling off here, or at least the fuel prices may be rolling off, but the natural gas prices are going up. How should we think about those puts and takes on the energy front for the rest of the year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So when you think about our energy spend, certainly, it's up over where we were a year over prior. It's down 10 basis points sequentially. Trying to anticipate exactly where that's going to head is challenging, certainly. But I can tell you this, we're focused on efficiencies that we can drive in our business that will lower our needs for natural gas and lower our needs for gas at the pump, and we're leveraging those. And that's helping us. That helps us with our CO2 emissions, and it helps us with our efficiencies in our business and our spend. And we're confident we can continue to make strides there. So that's -- where exactly natural gas prices will go this winter with what's going on in Europe and other areas, it's tough to tell for sure. But we'll manage through it, and we see opportunities to improve in our business and we're leveraging that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ashish, I might add that right around 60% of our energy spend is the gas -- or gas and diesel. And the remainder is electricity and natural gas. So the natural gas is a smaller component of that energy spend. More of it is the price at the pump, which as you suggested, is coming down. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we'll now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keen Fai Tong, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In the quarter, approximately what percentage of new business growth came from the no programmer market. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- George, this is Todd. The majority of our accounts are -- come from no programmers. So that is -- that trend has been consistent over the years and continues. And in a marketplace where it's still difficult for employers to find people to work offering a value of this and the way we handle it with uniforms is attractive for them. So it's another benefit for customers. And they see that as an opportunity to attract their employees and retain their employees. And we have one heck of an offering when it comes to that, that makes it really attractive for people. So I'd say those trends continue as they have been in the past. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keen Fai Tong, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Can you provide an update on uniform demand trends from the health care vertical? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, certainly. So the health care vertical is a very attractive vertical for us. It's growing nicely. Demographics are such in the United States and Canada that, that demand will continue. And we're seeing -- we have some unique offerings in that area with garment dispensing and our unique scrub line that makes it attractive. There are certainly other items that are -- that we lent into the health care market, whether it'd be in acute or non-acute. But we're -- we really like what we're seeing there from that demand. And I'll just -- I'll give you one example of a hospital that about 6 months ago, we sold a scrub rental program into that account. And it was a nice -- very nice size customer that you would recognize the name. In that case, the nurses that we were providing the program to, they were laundering the products at home. And the nurse has voiced a concern about safety, meaning, hey, what am I taking home? I'm laundering it? Am I laundering it correctly? And in that case, they chose Cintas because of a few things. One is our technology that we've deployed, that's unique that allows us to manage inventory for them, which provides the requisite access to the product, which is really, really important and also helps control their costs based upon how we manage that inventory. But also improves the safety aspect of it, separate from being an employee benefit. Because those, what I'll call, potentially contaminated goods or scrubs, they don't go home. We launder them appropriately via our hygienic process, hygienically cleaning process, which allows them to have the confidence that they're processed correctly and one that has improved safety. And just as an anecdote, I mentioned that was about 6 months ago, just recently we sold a microfiber white rental program to that same hospital. And so they use microfiber wipes in many ways, but -- and the most obvious one is when they're cleaning guest rooms or patient rooms, we should say. In this case, that particular hospital, they were purchasing those wipes and then they were having the, I'll call them, the hospital employees, or EBS type folks, that were cleaning those on their on-premise laundry. And in that case, they chose Cintas because it was able to -- we were able to reduce their labor costs. They're having troubles getting access to labor. And then, again, we're processing those in a manner where they can have great confidence that they're processed correctly with a hygienically clean process. So you asked your original question, George, was about uniform demand in hospitals, which is quite good. But it also -- there's so much that we can provide to those hospitals. And I just want to give one example to just give a little color around that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann of Baird. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew John Wittmann, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess, Mike, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what is implied in the guidance here. Maybe a couple of different ways to think about that. But how much conservatism is baked into the guidance? I know you made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks. Is there any change maybe sequentially to the guidance the way you're factoring in the macro outlook? And maybe any leading indicators that you can give us that gives us confidence that the economy is performing at the rate that you think it is. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, so let me start, Andy, with the guidance. The guidance implies -- and we're 60 days past when we gave the initial guidance. The guidance implies a really good growth through the rest of the year. But as you know, we do face some tougher comps as we saw the business pick up last year -- throughout the year. And so we would expect a little bit of deceleration from the growth levels of where we are, but still healthy growth and ending the year in a range of 9% to over 10%. And we like the momentum of the business today. And our expectation right now is that we're not seeing any change in the value that our customers are seeing, and we're not changing -- we're not seeing any change in the way -- in the economy, I'll say. Now maybe I'll flip to margins briefly. Our margin expectation remains that we will see margin improvement during the year in that range that we provided. It certainly contemplates that margin improvement even in a pretty challenging type of economic environment. So the guidance is a little bit better than we gave 60 days ago, part because of the first quarter, part because of the momentum that we see in the business. Now as it relates to trying to dissect what the economic picture is going to look like for the rest of the year, look, it's -- that's -- that can be pretty difficult, right? I mean, there are some who say we may be in a recession today. There are some who would say, we may be in a recession early 2023. Some would say we may be in a recession late in '23. The Fed has come out and said GDP for '23 is going to be 1.2%. It's hard to predict what we're going to see in the economic picture as we move forward. But what we know is that the momentum in our business today is really good. The value proposition that our customers see and our prospects see, they're reacting very positively to it. And because of that and many other factors, we believe that momentum can continue along with healthy margins. And that's what we've given you in our guidance. Does that help answer that question a bit? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew John Wittmann, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It does. I guess I wanted to then follow up with a question on, I guess, overall customer retention levels, considering that you're getting above historical averages in price increases, I thought maybe it would be helpful to comment on that. And you guys have talked about the sales [engine] in a couple of different ways. But if you look at sales productivity on a per head basis, is that metric up on a year-over-year basis as well? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andy, thanks for the question. This is Todd. First off, on retention, yes, our retention is very good. We like where that is. We like the momentum around that. We're organizing around it appropriately to make sure that we're meeting and exceeding our customers' demands. And we like our -- the product and service offering that we have. And the customers find it attractive. I mentioned some of the products and the technology that we have that are unique, and the customers like it. I think they also like our approach that we took over the past couple of years about being really flexible and empathetic with them as they were going through -- what they went through the various businesses through calendar '21 and calendar '22 -- '20 and '21, I should say, with the pandemic. So I think that was -- that is benefiting us because they saw that we were -- we understood what they were challenged with, and we pivoted to provide them what they needed, instead of just telling them, hey, here's what you were contracted to buy. So I think all that is paying off. As far as productivity and new business, yes, we like it. It's up. And we are -- certainly, we love our sales force. There -- we think they're well trained, well positioned. When sales partners have confidence in the products and the technology and the services that they're going to provide, that confidence is powerful. And it's showing itself in productivity and we like that. We're also deploying other types of technology via our investment with SAP. That's paying off in a number of ways. I'll just give you one as it relates to sales, which is investing in technology that allows for, what I'll call, best next prospect for a sales partner. Meaning instead of just calling blindly on businesses, we want to drive to our sales team who are -- who will be the next best prospect to call which, through analytics, we can tell them where to spend their time. And that's better for the partner, that's better for our company. Again, that provides more confidence. And yes, so that -- those types of investments are paying dividends for us. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We can now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Timothy Michael Mulrooney, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Group Head of Global Services &amp; Analyst [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We know energy was a slight headwind to margins in the quarter relative to last year, but gross margins were only down 10 basis points. So I was curious how some of the other cost buckets are trending? How are labor costs trending? Were those a headwind or a tailwind to margins? And anything else big to point out here like maybe materials and supplies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tim, maybe I'll start on that. From a gross margin perspective, you're right, we're down 10 basis points from last year in a period where total energy expenses are up 30 basis points. We're up 190 basis points sequentially. And so we've seen some nice improvement there. And look, when you think about that rental number of 47.5%, that's a really good gross margin for us. We've only been higher than that a few times, and that certainly is a much greater gross margin than we saw pre-pandemic. So we like the -- where we are in that space. We like the sequential improvement in the gross margin, which is pretty good. And we're doing it while we have -- we've seen such good growth in volume over the course of the last year, and we're able to be pretty flat overall in gross margins while we're investing in the business. So in other words, that volume growth over the last 12 months has certainly created the need for additional capacity, particularly in our laundry facilities, and we're investing as we should because we certainly want to make sure we have the capacity to serve the customer. And so nothing -- I would say nothing unusual to point out in there other than we continue to make the progress that we want to make. The only other thing I might say about that gross margin is we're seeing an all-time high in our First Aid and Safety business. And we continue to like the way that business is trending and the mix back towards that First Aid business that we love so much. Todd mentioned that the first Aid Part of that business is over 20% growth still. And we've seen some really nice movement there. So again, nothing real specific to point out, other than making good sequential progress and certainly continuing to invest for our future growth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Timothy Michael Mulrooney, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Group Head of Global Services &amp; Analyst [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, thanks Mike. I guess my follow-up, we'll just stick on that point, the First Aid and Safety gross margin really stuck out to me in the quarter. I mean, you're almost at 50% gross margin in that business, well above what we'd normally see there. Are there any extraordinary items to call out there that help drive those strong results that wouldn't necessarily repeat moving forward? Just trying to understand how to think about gross margins in First Aid moving forward as we model out the business for the rest of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Tim, this is Todd. We're proud of the gross margin improvement that we've made in the First Aid business. It is reflective certainly of the shift of the mix of the business. But I wouldn't say that there's anything that is out of the ordinary where you'd say, oh my goodness, what's -- is there something that -- a one-timer. So no. Now that being said, we're -- certainly there will be puts and takes of the First Aid business gross margin throughout the year. Don't think of it as a linear progression upward. It's -- we're making investments. We're growing that business really attractively. We are certainly leveraging -- trying to -- leverage very much as best we can the revenue growth that we're getting. But we've got to -- we've -- as Mike pointed out in all of our businesses, we've got to invest to meet the demand. And we're doing exactly that and trying to do it as intelligently and as efficiently as possible. But we're really happy with the demand levels that we're seeing and we're going to make sure we're positioned to meet those demand levels. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Timothy Michael Mulrooney, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Group Head of Global Services &amp; Analyst [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. That's really helpful. Congrats on a nice quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We can now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Manav Shiv Patnaik, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Lead Research Analyst [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I can appreciate, obviously, all the trends are very strong today. As you said, no economic weakness you're seeing in your businesses. But maybe you can help us with typically if that does start impacting your customers? Like how quickly do you see it? How quickly do they react? And I guess, what do you do in response to that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So Manav, a good question. We're not seeing it in our customer base today. And as a reminder, we're -- as of Friday, it will be 4 months into our fiscal year. And where we see it? How well -- what's this recession? Are we in one? As Mike said, is there one coming in the first half of '23? The back half? We're not trying to predict all that, but we are staying acutely aware. But we're positioning ourselves to make sure that we can grow in all types of economic cycles. And as a reminder, we've grown in 51 out of the last 53 years, the only exception being The Great Recession. We certainly hope that any recession that comes is not as severe as what that was. And so we -- and what I'll call in whatever the traditional type of recession, if that comes, then we expect good performance. We expect to grow. We have traditionally grown in multiples of GDP and jobs growth in the past. Mike spoke of our products and services are highly valued. You think about cleanliness, safety, image and compliance. Those are buying motives that are stronger today than they were in the past, certainly stronger than what they were even pre-pandemic. Our products and services are more diversified. Today, our customer base is more diversified today than it was in the past. Today, we're 70% services and 30% goods producing, so that diversification, we think, will help us. And when you think about NAICS codes, we have no 3-digit NAICS codes that is greater than 10%. So again, a really nice diversification there. We have also invested, as we've talked about in the past calls in our vertical sales approach, which we think gives nice diversifications into when you think about government and you think about health care, higher education, those types. We've spoken about our momentum that we think is really, really good. And also our strong cash flow, we think that will allow us to be opportunistic as we -- whenever we are into a recession, if that is today or in the future, we're going to be well positioned to make sure we're successful. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Manav Shiv Patnaik, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Lead Research Analyst [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Mike, if you could just remind us of your mix on the debt side between fixed and floating, whether you hedge just as we track these interest rate increases? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. We have -- as of the end of August, Manav, we've got about $500 million in commercial paper or other short-term variable debt. And the rest of our debt is fixed or senior notes. We do have some of our '27 maturities. The interest rates locked on those. Those are right now, as you can imagine, a fair amount in the money. So that's where we are today. And look, that the -- we like that. We like a little bit of that short-term debt because it gives us optionality. We can pay that down if we feel like we want to, or we can certainly have more space to use that if we needed to. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we can now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Charles Steinerman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - MD [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's Andrew. I just wanted to get a quick thought from you about organic revenue growth for the balance of the year from kind of each First Aid, Fire, Uniform Direct. Those had particularly strong first quarters. I definitely heard your general comments about tougher comps. And like do you think each of these 3 should be double-digit organic growers this year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew, thank you for the question. When I think about each of our businesses, we don't give guidance based upon each of them individually. But I'll just provide some -- maybe some top line thoughts. I'm really -- I haven't done the calculus on what it would be for the year, but I'm just thinking about the -- through the Qs 2 through 4 for each. I would think about Uniform Rental, Fire and the First Aid business, all being high single digits at the balance of the year. Keeping in mind that there was some PPE in the First Aid business in our Q3, which will provide a tougher comp for sure. And then in our Uniform Direct Sale business, we're going to be up against much tougher comps. So I would think of that from high single to flat, to maybe even negative in Q4 based upon the significant comps that we're up against there, which is obviously a little bit more lumpy business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Charles Steinerman, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - MD [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just say that last part again, about Uniform Direct Sale, high single digit, but then you said flat. Just you were talking about Q2 through 4. Just say the last part again, about Uniform Direct sales. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So when you think about the Uniform Direct sale business, again, a lumpier business, high single to in -- from Q2 through 4. Think about high single down to closer to flat to maybe even negative in Q4 due to negative sales growth, due to the negative -- or excuse me, the significant comps that we'll be up against on the back half of the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we can now take our next question from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I guess I'm curious, like what has gone better than what you expected when you first gave the guide a couple of months ago, especially as it relates to revenues? I know you mentioned better pricing. And I'm curious if the pricing update has been better than expected, or is it better new business? I know you mentioned the health care vertical, in particular. So just more perspective on like what you think really drove the outperformance, specifically in the rental business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Faiza, thanks for the question. It's Todd. I'll start. If Mike, you want to chime in. There's many contributing inputs to our positive growth that we're seeing. New business is quite good as we spoke about. But retention and penetration is very attractive as well. We continue to improve upon our cross-sell. And then as you mentioned, pricing is certainly playing a larger role than it did historically as it should, because of the levels of cost increase that we are seeing via -- whether it's labor or material cost and what have you. So I think, just generally speaking, we like the key inputs that we're seeing. I mentioned earlier our diversification into those various businesses, verticals, et cetera, they're all -- we like the momentum we're seeing in all of those. So pretty widespread. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Faiza Alwy, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And then just a follow-up on the labor environment. I don't know if you're seeing some easing in the environment in your business at this point. And I'm curious how you think about that going forward? So is that -- as the labor environment eases, is that a benefit for you? Or is that maybe more of a headwind from a competitive perspective? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good question. On labor, I'd say easing a bit, but that's relative. It is still a very challenging environment. But maybe not as quite as challenging as it was 6 months ago, 8 months ago, but still quite challenging. And we are in constant pursuit of attracting and retaining the very, very best people. We think that gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So when we look out and say, okay, what does that mean to us? We're constantly in pursuit of that. So any easing of the labor market would certainly be welcome from a standpoint of making it a little bit easier to run at lower RPMs. But here's what I know is we -- our team figures it out. And they have -- they are staffed at the appropriate levels to meet our customers' demand. They've done one heck of a job in fighting through all these challenges over the past couple of years to make sure that we're positioned to be successful. So whatever the environment, our team will figure it out. We've shown that building in the past. We'll pivot appropriately. But -- so we'll manage through it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we'll now take our next question from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Heather Nicole Balsky, BofA Securities, Research Division - VP [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On the new customer growth front, could -- you already touched on health care earlier in the Q&amp;A. But where else are you seeing some of the momentum? Are there additional verticals where you're seeing outside growth or you're targeting verticals you haven't been in the past. It would be great to get color on that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Heather, thanks for the question. Again, our experience is very broad in our -- the successes that we're seeing. But I'll just give you one -- another example that might provide a little color in one of our verticals we -- where we're calling on the government sector. There's one particular city that I won't mention, but you'll know the name of it. About a year ago, we sold a uniform program into that city. And as an example there, that was into the sanitation, transportation, parks and recreation-type departments. And in that case, they were using a local provider before we took over that account. And they chose us, in that case, because they liked our -- our garment offering was better, meaning they felt we had better more attractive garments that their employees wanted to wear. Our garment tracking technology helped them to reduce costs, meaning less lost garments and what have you. And then our -- as I mentioned earlier, our investment into our MyCintas web portal makes it -- made it easier for them to do business with us, so -- which reduces their administrative time and just is helpful for them. So that was about a year ago. And then if you fast forward, just recently, we sold them a First Aid Cabinet service to all those departments and even more municipal buildings. And in that case, previously, they had ordered all their First Aid products online. So they were a new programmer. They were ordering it from whomever online, and then they were essentially doing all that work and filling those cabinets themselves. And coincidentally, the sales lead for that opportunity came from our uniform service provider. So while there, the uniform service provider was speaking to the customer, and they said, ""hey, we're -- we need help here"". So the uniform service provider passed it on to our -- the appropriate person and our First Aid service provider. In that case, they chose us because, again, a better management of the products. And we're able to help them manage the products better, improve their compliance, reduce their costs, and remove their need to administer the program. So you think about what businesses are challenged with, in this case, it's a -- it was a city government, but it's still -- they're still running it as a business where they have to meet their customers' demands and their employees' demands. And that's, I think, another example of just how we are growing our business and why it's attractive for businesses, sticky, good retention, good cross-sell, and that shows itself in new business. Hopefully, that color helps a little bit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Heather Nicole Balsky, BofA Securities, Research Division - VP [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And then just a question on pricing. Can you just walk us through where you are in the process of taking, I guess, this outsized pricing you've been taking? When did it start? Kind of when do you start to anniversary it? Just trying to think through the flow-through as we progress over the next few quarters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, Heather, pricing is -- it's a local subject. It's a customer-by-customer subject, meaning some businesses are doing better than others. And -- but as we look at that, when inflation kicked in to much higher degrees, then that required us to make sure that our price adjustments were higher than historical as well. So you can think about it that way. When inflation was -- went to above historical levels, that's when we adjust the pricing at above historical levels. And as far as what that means moving forward, that will depend upon the -- what inflation does moving forward. So I don't have a crystal ball as it applies to that or recession, what have you, but we're paying very, very close attention to all those inputs and we'll manage it appropriately. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll now take our next question from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seth Robert Weber, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I actually had a pricing question as well, kind of a similar question. So Todd, I guess I'm trying to understand how much of the price increases that you guys have been pushing through are just purely tied to inflation? And how much of it is Cintas just trying to get more for the value prop that you're offering today? So I'm trying to understand, will pricing revert back to its traditional level if inflation recedes? Or do you think that pricing can be structurally higher for Cintas just based on the greater value that you're offering to your customers kind of today versus history, if that makes sense? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Seth, it's a fair question. As I think about our customer base, we've such a broad customer base. So -- some of them, we have contractual commitments. Some of them, we have the ability to adjust prices closer to inflation or what have you. So it's very, very broad, and it really depends on the particular customer and the health of that customer as well. But here's what I can tell you is that we take a long-term approach. We don't think about our customers in quarters or fiscal years. We think about them in -- over decades. And that approach has really paid off -- paid big dividends for us. Now we are constantly trying to improve the value that we provide to our customers. That being said, when the inflation is at the levels it's at, it requires us to adjust prices at above historical. When inflation comes back down, and we certainly hope and expect that, that will occur, then I think you can think of our price adjustments to be back closer to more historical. We're now -- am I constantly trying to improve the value to our customers? Absolutely. That pursuit will be in perpetuity. And the marketplace determines how that pricing is handled appropriately. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seth, I might add 2 things. One, you bring up kind of the structure of our pricing. And we're generally the highest price relative to our competition in the space. So in other words, we don't leave with price generally. We believe that our products, our service, they are better. And that generally means we are at higher price points than our competition. And I don't expect that, that would change. As Todd said, we are continuing to look for ways of even improving that value more in the future. But I don't see that type of pricing changing because of the inflation going up and down. We believe that we can command the best prices because our products are better, like Carhartt and other products like that, and our service is just better. The other thing I might add is our pricing, as Todd said, is customer by customer and local. And it's not necessarily a -- we have to offset or we look to offset inflation immediately. Generally speaking, we want to do the best for our customers and continue to add the right value. But we also know that given the way our cost structure works, we don't have to necessarily immediately offset inflation. We get, for example, the products that we rent in our rental business, we get to amortize them, right? And so if we do have to take a cost increase, we get -- we certainly get visibility before that hits our P&amp;L because that has to go through the manufacturing process. Then it gets to our locations and then it amortizes over a period of time. And so we can have multiple price increases before that hits our P&amp;L. And that ability to anticipate and manage our cost structure as well as our pricing, it's reflected in the fact that even in this pretty darn difficult environment, we've been able to increase our margins year-over-year, certainly excluding those onetime gains. But we've been able to continue to increase our margins during that period of time. So I just give you that color to say we are very thoughtful about the way we price, and we are thoughtful about the way we anticipate the costs within our cost structure. And it works because we're able to increase our margins in a pretty difficult inflationary environment in each of the last 4 quarters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Seth Robert Weber, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, it makes total sense, Mike. I appreciate it, guys. That's super helpful. And that's really all I had today. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shlomo H. Rosenbaum, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's pretty noticeable that the cost of goods sold is up only like $10 million sequentially. But when I look at the SG&amp;A, it's up like $46 million. And usually, when you have some kind of inflationary prices, I would have thought it hit COGS more. Maybe you could explain to us what the changes were in SG&amp;A? And was there some kind of significant investments in production or anything like that? And maybe if you can bring it down to kind of the unit level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, Shlomo, I'll speak to the SG&amp;A piece of this. Yes, we did have some sequential increase. But Shlomo, if you look at going back to -- I've got -- going back to fiscal '15, our first quarter SG&amp;A is usually the highest of the year. I'll throw out the pandemic impacted year. But our first quarter is usually the highest SG&amp;A quarter of the year, and that's been consistent for a number of years. And that's simply because of some things like we have higher payroll taxes when our equity compensation vests at that period of time. It usually happens in the first quarter. We tend to have a little bit more stock options that create more payroll taxes. We tend to have some beginning of the year meetings and other things that happen. But year-over-year, if you pull that gain out that we've been talking about, where our SG&amp;A is down 40 basis points. And so we like -- we do like the movement of that SG&amp;A. And gosh, if you go back to pre-pandemic, Q1 of 2020, we're down almost 300 basis points. If you go back to 2019's SG&amp;A, we're down 260 basis points. My point, Shlomo is, this is not unusual for us to have a first quarter higher SG&amp;A because of just the way that our business works and the timing. But year-over-year, we continue to make really good performance in that. And in this case, down 40 basis points. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shlomo H. Rosenbaum, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then maybe you can also talk about the higher revenue kind of translated into margin for 2 of the units. But for kind of the other unit, it didn't look like it's translating exactly the same way. Is there something that was -- is there a mix item in terms of what was being sold over there? And then just maybe you can just touch on your expectation for cash flow for the end of the year. With such strong revenue, should we expect there to be a working capital drag so we wouldn't necessarily see revenue grow the same way that we would see earnings grow? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shlomo, I'll talk to the all other first. I'm not sure if you're talking year-over-year, that gain that we've referred to a number of times is in the all other. And so you have to make sure that you're stripping out that gain, 14.7% for the quarter for us, that is a pretty good quarter. But as Todd mentioned a little bit ago, that Uniform Direct sale piece that can tend to move up and down a bit and be more inconsistent from quarter to quarter, and that's a bit of what we've seen in this quarter. So once you pull out the gain from last year where we had that outsized operating margin in all other, we're at a pretty good spot at 14.7%, and it more than anything is attributable to that lumpiness in the Uniform Direct Sale business. As it relates to our cash flow, look, we like where the cash flow is. We're -- our operating cash flow is up 13.7% year-over-year. Free cash flow is up 7%. And look, from quarter-to-quarter, there can be puts and takes. But generally speaking, our cash flow is really good. And I expect that we'll see a continued, very good conversion from net income to operating cash flow. Now when we grow, and we've been growing quite nicely, we have always been a bit of a drag in working capital because our AR tends to go up as we grow, our uniforms in service and other items in service tends to grow -- go up as we grow, and that certainly has happened. But we're still turning that into really good cash flow, and I would expect that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We're going to probably be a little bit higher in CapEx during this fiscal '23 year because we've -- again, we've kind of come from a pandemic period where we didn't need to grow capacity. And we've really seen some nice growth over the course of the last -- more than fiscal year. And that certainly means we do some investing. And so you're going to see a little bit of an increase in CapEx, but right in the range where we've guided to that 3% to 3.5% of revenue. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [53] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And we can now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Andrew Schneeberger, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [54] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think kind of go back to the recession question, the essence of the question is going to be visibility. It's been asked a few times on the call, but your guidance -- your quarter is obviously quite strong, and the guidance is certainly ambitious. And I view you guys as generally pretty conservative. So things must look really good for you right now and through the end of the fiscal year. So not to have kind of asked this, but I want to delve in a little bit deeper. When do you see when you're working with your customers, something like going back to past recessions, what are the first signs you see? How do they manifest? And what type of visibility do you have into, okay, that's going to affect our numbers weeks, months, quarters later? If you could just tell us kind of going back to past recession, how that takes shape. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [55] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Mike, certainly, if you want to chime in. When we think about -- again, are we in a recession? Technical, is one coming in early '23, late '23? How severe? We don't know those items, but we are watching it very closely. When you think about our customer base, how might it show up? Will customers -- if their demand is being impacted, then they're going to look for ways to cut their costs. Is that in getting -- they'll look at their P&amp;L and say, okay, what's the biggest things I can move on. And frankly, we're not usually top of their list. So -- and the reason being is because our spend per customer is pretty small. But that being said, will they reduce their needs for certain services, reduce quantities of products that they need? Certainly, those types of things can happen if their demand is being impacted. So those are the items that we look for is -- are customers reducing their needs because their demand of their business is such that they don't need as much. So I'd say that would be one of the certainly bigger categories that we look for. Mike, any other thoughts, but those are -- that was the first one that came to mind. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- J. Michael Hansen, Cintas Corporation - CFO &amp; Executive VP [56] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think that's true. We may see some of those kinds of signs. We may see a couple of our customers go out of business, depending on the type of recession. But the other thing that I think is really important is we've grown through lots of recessions in the last 50 years. And we have also sold a lot of new business through every recession. And so even if we start to see some signs that the customers are paying a little bit more attention to their spending, we know this that we're not asking them generally to spend new money, it's spend it with us. And we'll help them with our programs to reduce their own work content. In other words, they can -- they find their people can do more with less because we're able to take some work away from them and we're not necessarily asking them to spend new dollars. So we -- look, we're going to be paying attention to all different kinds of things within the economy. But we know this, we're going to sell a lot of new business. We're going to sell to new programmers. We're going to help our customers reduce their own work content. And that's why we feel -- we not only do we love the momentum that we have but as we look forward, that value proposition is still resonating very, very well. We've said that a number of times. And we don't see that changing. And so we feel pretty good. And we generally -- our guidance is a reflection of that and we like where we're headed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Andrew Schneeberger, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Analyst [57] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Excellent. That sounds good. I think a good follow-on there. You've alluded to M&amp;A, but we haven't really discussed it on this call. How is the environment right now? Are you seeing more opportunities? Or is that pretty steady? Any commentary on multiples? Is that something that's looking more attractive, less attractive? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [58] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Scott, this is Todd. Deal flow is good. We love our balance sheet. We love our position in the marketplace. That being said, those M&amp;A type of opportunities, they're tough to pace them, tough to -- there's various items that cause things to flip the switch for someone to sell their business. But I can tell you this, we're really well positioned. We love our balance sheet, love our team and the ability to manage through any M&amp;A. And we think that, that's going to be an opportunity for us in the future, and we're well positioned for it. That being said, again, it's tough to pay some, but deal flow looks good. And I don't see anything that's all that different from a multiple standpoint in the marketplace. So we'll -- we're interested in any and all opportunities from an M&amp;A standpoint, and we'll continue to push for those. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [59] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We can now take our final question from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Toni Michele Kaplan, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Senior Analyst [60] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wanted to ask a longer-term margin question. If I look back about 2 years ago, your EBITDA margin like really meaningfully stepped up to mid-20s. At the beginning, I think you're benefiting from travel -- reduced travel during the pandemic and health care costs. You've really been able to keep it at that level. And I know you talked about adjusting your cost structure at the beginning of the pandemic. But basically, what type of expenses have you been able to adjust so that you can stay at this mid-20s EBITDA level. Just how sustainable is it? It seems like it is but wanted to just get some additional color there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [61] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Toni, this is Todd. You're absolutely correct. And when we look forward, we see incremental margins. We talk about 20% to 30%, and we see that in our future. And we are leveraging certainly the top line very nicely. We manage our variable cost, I think, quite well. The team is very, very good at that. And -- but we're also getting efficiencies from some of our digital transformation that we've talked about in the past. You see that -- certainly, energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our smart truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with our energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. And one of the things we talk about around here is that we don't make money when the wheels are moving in our trucks. So getting those efficiencies is very important. We're extracting other efficiencies via our investment with SAP, with our inventory control programs that are allowing us to get better reuse of our products in our stock rooms, which also helps improve turnaround time for our customers. We think it's very, very important, which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. I mentioned in our last call, we have an operational excellence dashboard that provides us better transparency into the efficiency levels at each of our production facilities. So that is significant, right? So we're able to understand the efficiency levels of our facilities not by having to be there in-person every day, but by understanding the metrics of our operational excellence dashboard in real time. So I guess it's a blessing that we have those opportunities to improve. It's frustrating that we have opportunities to improve, but we're focused on improving those and extracting those efficiencies. So that will allow us to continue to provide good incremental margins, separate from the items that I mentioned before with some of the other technologies that we've deployed with making it a better win for customers and how they're doing business with us. So yes, as we look forward, we're going to continue to extract those efficiencies and provide what we think are attractive incremental margins. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Toni Michele Kaplan, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Senior Analyst [62] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And on a more sort of current basis, any changes to contract structure, changes in contract lengths, any increasing the minimum thresholds for clients? Anything to call out there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Todd M. Schneider, Cintas Corporation - CEO, President &amp; Director [63] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Toni, I would say it's nothing out of the ordinary. Certainly, we take a very long-term approach with our customers. They take a long-term approach with us. And we make sure that we're positioned to meet their needs and exceed them and provide products and services that they really value. And so that's what we're doing in the marketplace, and that tends to show itself in -- I'll just call it long-term relationships. Others might call those contracts, but I call them long-term relationships with our customers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [64] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Paul Adler for closing remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul F. Adler, Cintas Corporation - VP of IR &amp; Treasurer [65] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '23 financial results in late December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [66] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

(NYSE:WMT) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the , M. Biggs, for US$3.1m worth of shares, at about US$140 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$133. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Walmart didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Walmart Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Walmart shares. In total, President C. McMillon sold US$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does Walmart Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$3.3b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Walmart Tell Us?An insider sold Walmart shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Walmart makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Walmart that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

In some cases, as much as 10 percent to 15 percent of a regional retailer’s base of stores will be closed for at least two days, and could possibly sustain damage due to winds and flooding. Particularly hurt will be those single-unit mom-and-pop stores solely dependent on local populations that started evacuating this week.More from WWDInside the Neiman Marcus ""Live Your Luxury"" NYFW Cocktail Party6 Headlines that Captivated the Retail Industry in 2019CEO Talks: Michael Kliger, president, mytheresa.comNational chains like JCPenney and Walmart have scores of stores in the hurricane’s path, but it’s still a relatively small percentage of their total businesses.“Hurricane Ian will impact much of Florida, including major population centers such as Tampa, St. Petersburg, Naples, Orlando and Jacksonville as well as highly populated markets in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions,” Evan Gold, executive vice president of global partnerships and alliances at Planalytics, told WWD. “In addition to heavy rain, flooding, high winds and possibly tornadoes, Ian is likely to bring widespread power outages and dangerous storm surge.”While the hurricane impact will be significant — it’s the first hurricane to hit Tampa Bay in more than 100 years — this is not a big volume period for retailers considering it’s the middle of the week and not a weekend or holiday period, and back-to-school selling has passed. It’s also still quite warm in the South so fall selling wouldn’t necessarily be very big.At midday Wednesday, Walmart had a total of more than 200 stores and warehouse clubs closed. “The safety of our associates, customers and members is always our top priority,” Walmart indicated in a statement. “Walmart’s Emergency Operations Center is monitoring Hurricane Ian in real-time, assessing the status of our facilities in the path of the storm. We will continue operating as long as it is safe to do so.Story continues“A map has been built to assist our customers and the communities we serve to help them plan for the storm and possible effects. This map will continue to update in real time to give users the most up to date information available,” Walmart continued.A Neiman Marcus spokesperson said, “The safety and well-being of our customers, associates and brand partners is our top priority. To encourage individuals to follow important evacuation orders, Neiman Marcus Group closed our Tampa Bay, Orlando and Sawgrass Mills stores. Those locations will remain closed until it is safe to return. Our active partnership and point-of-sale campaign supporting the American Red Cross is already helping fuel efforts to shelter and support thousands of families impacted by Hurricane Ian. NMG’s Employee Hardship Assistance Fund will be available for our associates facing financial hardship as a result of the storm.”Bloomingdale’s closed its Orlando store on Wednesday and will be closed on Thursday.At Saks Fifth Avenue, “Based on the severity of the storm, we made the decision to close our stores in both Naples and Sarasota early on Tuesday to allow our associates to attend to their homes and families,” a spokeswoman told WWD. On Wednesday, both Saks stores remained closed and Saks continue to monitor the situation at other Florida locations. “We have also activated our associate relief fund for any associates impacted by the hurricane, allowing them to apply for relief funding for emergency needs such as housing and health care. As always, the safety and well-being of our associates is our utmost priority. We also take the security of our buildings seriously and take every measure we can to protect them and our associates in unfortunate situations like Hurricane Ian.”JCPenney begins monitoring potential storm impact well in advance of the storm making landfall, including monitoring not only the path but windspeed and rainfall forecasts for store locations, according to a spokeswoman.  “Care is taken to panel and sandbag stores.  JCPenney is in continuous contact with the store teams, field facilities teams and business partners throughout preparation and during the storm.  A virtual command center is set up which offers store and field teams an open line of communication to report concerns and request support.  This line is also used to coordinate safe return to business.  JCPenney’s priority is safely closing our locations allowing time for associates to personally prepare for inclement weather.”The Penney’s spokeswoman also said the company coordinates teams from other areas and stages support safely away from the storm so JCPenney can provide the quickest, safest response.  “JCPenney asks its associates not to respond to the stores until the company is able to complete a visual or on-site inspection; and even then, provide direction on what to look for to identify potential safety hazards.”In addition, each year ahead of hurricane season Penney’s takes precautions to clear dock and roof drains and communicate hurricane/storm safety topics to stores. When natural disasters are declared, Penney’s provides financial support to associates to cover immediate needs such as food, clothing and transportation.“Our first priority is the safety of our associates and customers,” a spokeswoman from Saks Off 5th said. “We are closely watching the path of the storm and taking all precautions to ensure the safety of our team. At this time, seven out of our 12 stores in Florida are currently closed and will remain so until conditions are deemed safe. We’re focused on our people and providing as much support as we can during this time.”Gold from Planalytics, which specializes in quantifying the sales impact the weather has on consumer purchasing to help retailers in their planning, said, “During hurricanes and other severe weather events, consumers shift to need-based purchasing involving ‘pantry loading,’ emergency items such as batteries, flashlights, ice and generators, and protective products such as plywood.”As such, he added, “This won’t be a great week for jewelry store sales, consumer electronics and most apparel.”However, according to Gold, home centers and hardware stores emerge as the biggest gainers in advance and in the aftermath of the storm for clean-up and repair items. Groceries, convenience stores, dollar stores and quick-serve and drive-through restaurants could also see a lift.According to Planalytics, other businesses and sectors that experience losses from hurricanes are:Entertainment/tourism, shopping malls and outlet centers. (Note that DisneyWorld is closing this week.) An exception to this can be “on demand video” for those stuck at home/sheltering in place.Restaurants, particularly fine dining and casual/sit down chains. “In most cases, these are totally lost sales that are not made up,” Gold said. An exception to this can be fast-food chains along evacuation routes.Apparel and other speciality retail chains. “An exception to this can be need-based apparel such as rainwear,” Gold said.Planalytics estimates that three days ahead of the storm, overall revenue can increase by 5 percent to 10 percent above normal sales. Two days ahead of the storm overall revenue can increase by 10 percent to 20 percent above normal sales, and one day ahead of the storm, revenue can increase by 30 percent to 50 percent. Sales of certain specific products, like canned foods, bottled water, batteries, flashlights, ice, wiper blades, can double or even triple, according to Planalytics.“After the storm, businesses will look to open up as quickly as possible once it is deemed safe to do so,” Gold said. “Agile supply chains are already staging goods outside of the projected impact area to be able to bring post-storm clean up items in and to replenish items that are high in demand such as ice, generators and water.”]"

As part of the initiative, the Biden administration wants to update regulations that allow online shopping with programs such as food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).Instacart, which has allowed food stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card purchases for the last two years for certain grocers, said in a statement that it plans to include TANF next year, and is also pushing to offer food stamp payments to all grocery partners.More than 21.4 million U.S. households use food stamps, with nearly 3 million of the families ordering their groceries online, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Food stamps restrict shoppers to nonalcoholic beverages, cold food items, seeds and plants.Expanding payment options for low-income shoppers could help the delivery platforms lure low-income grocery shoppers away from Walmart.com and Amazon.com, which also have food stamp payment options.More than 783,000 homes receive TANF cash benefits, which help families purchase toiletries and other essential items.Instacart's TANF addition will cover non-grocery items and service and delivery fees, which are not covered by SNAP EBT benefits. The company previously waived its $3.99 delivery fees for food stamp purchases.Shipt shoppers will also be able to pay for orders with SNAP EBT in 2023. The delivery company currently powers grocery retailer Meijer's website and allows food stamp payments through that platform. Target.com customers can make grocery purchases online with SNAP EBT and their deliveries are powered by Shipt.Story continuesShipt Chief Executive Kamau Witherspoon told Reuters that the delivery service is aiming to launch its expanded programs in early 2023.""To make an impact on food security here in the U.S., it truly is an all-hands-on-deck type of problem,"" Witherspoon said. ""From local government to federal government, public sector and private sector, it's going to take all of us to come together to solve this issue.""Shipt does not currently offer any WIC or TANF payment options. Instacart does not currently offer WIC payments. Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, is participating in a WIC online pilot program through the USDA; however, the company did not announce any expansions to its current offerings for low-income shoppers on Wednesday.Amazon provides discounted Prime memberships of $6.99 per month to subscribers participating in government assistance programs. However, the subscriptions cannot be paid for directly with the benefits. Amazon Prime membership is usually $14.99 per month.SNAP EBT Amazon shoppers also receive additional discounts of up to 15% off on select meat, produce and toiletries purchased at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods.Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether the companies have any announcements related to the White House health initiatives.

This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$746k.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Marc Oken bought US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$149). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Marc Oken.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$180m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insiders?The fact that there have been no Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders think the business has merit.

Equity Residential EQR was not spared either. The stock has lost 12.1% in the past month compared with the industry’s decline of 10.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the recent sell-off marks a good entry point for investors. We believe the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has strong growth potential and seems a solid choice.Analysts too seem bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook, with estimates having been revised 1.2% upward over the past two months to $3.51. This also calls for 17.4% growth year over year compared with the industry’s average of 12.60%.What Makes Equity Residential a Solid Pick?Solid Property Base and Technology Implementation: Equity Residential has a dominating presence in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. The residential REIT is also growing its presence in Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin. It is focusing on urban and high-density suburban markets where affluent long-term renters want to live. This diversification is expected to provide the company with a steady rental cash flow over the long term.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and to improve the efficiency of its operating platform. This is likely to provide the company with a competitive edge over others.Healthy Operating Performance: Per Equity Residential’s August operating update, it concluded a strong leasing season, driven by healthy demand and pricing for its apartment units. Consequently, same-store revenue growth is on track to either match or surpass the company’s projections mentioned in its second-quarter 2022 earnings release. Physical occupancy remained high through June and July 2022 at 96.7% and 96.5%, respectively. The preliminary physical occupancy rate for August was 96.6%. The percentage of residents renewing by month for June was 55%, whereas, in July and August, it remained steady at 52%.Balance Sheet Strength: Equity Residential has a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and financial flexibility. Moreover, unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI was 88.4% as of Jun 30, 2022. The company ended the second quarter with lower net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 5.01X. An A-rated balance sheet further renders the company access to the debt market.With $2.3 billion in available liquidity, limited near-term debt maturities, solid credit metrics and sufficient access to capital markets at favorable rates, the company is well poised to meet its future obligations as well as ride on its growth curve.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Equity Residential remains committed to this purpose. The company increased its dividend four times in the past 5 years, and its payout has grown 4.29% over the same time period. Currently, EQR pays a dividend of 62.50 cents per share. Given more balance sheet strength compared to its peers and recovery in business, EQR’s dividend is expected to be sustainable in the days to come.

It's been nearly three years since the city allowed mainland tour groups, so it goes without saying that players are ready to get back.Three stocks that popped yesterday on the news include Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resortsand MGM Resorts International.As we can see, LVS shares have been notably strong, with MGM shares being the weakest.It raises a valid question: should investors try to tap into the resurgence of Macau? Let's take a deeper look.Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts is a leading casino resort developer, owner, and operator. The company owns and operates casino hotel resort properties Wynn Macau and the Wynn Palace, located in the Special Administrative Region of Macau.Wynn also owns and operates casino hotel resort properties Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas.Investors took the news well; yesterday, shares closed up 12%.The announcement comes at a critical time – WYNN has struggled to exceed quarterly estimates, missing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in eight of its previous ten quarters.However, the company did pencil in a strong 12.8% bottom-line beat in its latest quarter, perhaps indicating that the tide could be turning.Story continuesRevenue results have also been primarily disheartening, with Wynn Resorts exceeding top-line estimates in just three of its last ten prints.Still, the company's revenue appears to have recovered from the initial pandemic shock.In addition, WYNN shares carry a 1.9X forward price-to-sales ratio, nicely below its five-year median of 2.3X but representing a 12% premium relative to its Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector.Wynn Resorts carries a Style Score of a D for Value.Las Vegas SandsLas Vegas Sands is a leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts primarily operating in the U.S. and Asia. The company's Macau business comprises the following resorts: Sands Macau, Venetian Macau, Four Seasons Macau, and Parisian Macau.Las Vegas Sands shares were hot yesterday, closing up more than 11%.The pandemic restrictions have hit LVS hard; the company has missed the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven of its last ten quarters.Top-line results paint the same story, with Las Vegas Sands exceeding revenue estimates in just three of its last ten prints.However, similar to WYNN, it appears that the company's revenue has recovered nicely from its 2020 lows.Still, LVS carries stretched valuation levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of an F for Value.The company's 6.9X forward price-to-sales ratio is undoubtedly on the steep side, well above its five-year median of 4.4X and representing a rich 314% premium relative to its Zacks Sector.MGM Resorts International MGM Resorts International is a holding company that owns and operates casino resorts through wholly owned subsidiaries. MGM's China operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino.MGM shares came out of the gate hot, touching a price of roughly $31.50 before tumbling and closing the day down a marginal 0.2%.MGM has a much stronger earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in eight of its last ten quarters. Still, the gaming titan posted a wide 87% bottom-line miss in its latest report.Top-line results have been impressive; MGM has chained together seven consecutive revenue beats. In addition, MGM has a notably stronger revenue trend than WYNN and LVS.Further, the company sports a Style Score of an A, indicating that shares could be considered undervalued.MGM's 0.9X forward price-to-sales ratio is nowhere near its 1.4X five-year median and reflects an attractive 36% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Bottom LineA curb on travel-related restrictions has put the gambling capital of the world, Macau, in the spotlight.After years of depressed foot traffic stemming from pandemic restrictions, consumers look to get back into the casinos, undoubtedly a positive for any company with exposure to the city.All three stocks above – Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International – have operations in Macau.In addition, all three carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).All three would provide exposure for investors looking to tap into the cash that'll soon be flowing in Macau.However, investors should approach the situation carefully.Many unknowns could occur in the coming months, especially with the lingering pandemic.A great approach would be waiting until positive earnings estimate revisions start rolling in.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

42,f4911080-8cdc-33bd-b7dc-89254f20577c,MET,2022-09-29,5 Dividend-Paying Multiline Insurers That Ensure Stable Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-paying-multiline-insurers-171405913.html,1664385245,STORY,"['ORI', 'PRU', 'RDN', 'HIG-PG', 'MET-PE']","[With the major indices — S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite — losing steam, investors are looking for returns on their investment in the form of dividends. The hawkish move of the Fed to cut down inflation (having increased interest rate fives time already in 2022), concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a strong dollar are causing the weakness in the stock market.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry’s performance too has been affected. The industry has lost 13.7% year to date. Amid this, players like MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, Old Republic International Corporation ORI and Radian Group Inc. RDN, who have an impressive dividend history, offer a breather.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio that in turn lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness driving higher demand for protection products should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, that in turn will drive a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4% while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.The Fed’s hawkish move is a boon for the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%. These stocks have a payout ratio of less than 60, reflecting enough room for future dividend increases. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Radian Group, with a market capitalization of $3.1 billion, is a credit enhancement company, which supports homebuyers, mortgage lenders, loan servicers and investors with a suite of private mortgage insurance and related risk-management products and services.RDN witnessed a four-year CAGR of 199.1%. Riding on continued financial strength and flexibility, Radian declared a 43% increase in quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2022, which translated into the highest dividend yield in the private MI industry. Its current dividend yield of 3.7% betters the industry average of 2.5%. The insurer’s payout ratio is 19, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 245.8%. (Check Radian Group’s dividend history here)Radian Group Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)Radian Group Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)Radian Group Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Radian Group Inc. QuoteRadian’s mortgage insurance portfolio is expected to create a strong foundation for future earnings. RDN remains focused on improving its mortgage insurance portfolio, the main catalyst of long-term earnings growth. For 2022, Radian estimates total mortgage originations to be nearly $3 trillion, reflecting an 8% increase in purchase originations and a 58% decrease in refinance activity. Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows.

In the same months last year, imports were 64 and 63 million litres respectively, well above national demand.Nigeria's reliance on imported oil products looks set to continue, two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said, with a new refinery near Lagos unlikely to come online until the end of 2023 and a revamp of the 210,000 barrel-per-day Port Harcourt facility expected to take several years.NNPC and Nigeria's finance ministry did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment.'CURIOUS CASE'Although the Nigerian government announced plans to remove the gasoline subsidy last year, it then backtracked in July, citing concerns over potential social unrest.The World Bank estimates inflationary pressures will tip 7 million more Nigerians into poverty this year, bringing the total to 45% of the population of 200 million.""Despite the better-than-expected performance of the services and agriculture sectors and higher oil prices ... Nigeria is experiencing a curious case of lower fiscal revenues,"" Marco Hernandez, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria, said in a June development Report.""This is limiting the government's ability to expand basic services, support the economic recovery, and protect the poor during this difficult time,"" Hernandez added in the report.Nigeria's Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed has repeatedly warned about the high cost of gasoline subsidies, saying the bill could reach $16.2 billion in 2023.And the World Bank estimated that foregone oil revenues would total 5 trillion naira ($12.04 billion) this year due to the subsidy, equivalent to 30% of Nigeria's entire budget.In 2020, NNPC retained 4% of oil and gas sales to cover gasoline subsidies. This rose to 45% last year and in 2022 it has reached 83% of sales.The increasing fuel subsidy is taking away money from capital expenditure and is a ""major drainer to overall government revenues and fiscal position,"" Nigeria's finance ministry said in its latest budget projection in August.""The subsidy on Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) supply has had significant adverse impact on government revenues,"" it added.Nwanze of SBM Intelligence said: ""The subsidy is a complete waste at this point, but it's politically explosive.""Nigeria holds presidential elections in February against a backdrop of price rises as a result of the Ukraine crisis and post-pandemic supply chain bottlenecks.As well as the higher cost of gasoline purchases, a more costly swap contract has also come at a bad time.Until the end of last year, NNPC covered domestic gasoline needs via Direct Sale Direct Purchase (DSDP) contracts.Now NNPC is also buying ad hoc cargoes and through a Crude Oil Refining and Direct Partnership Agreement (CORDPA), which involves paying higher premiums and a trader waiting longer to receive its crude delivery as payment.In May, for example, the DSDP premium was around $10 per tonne of gasoline, while the premium paid under a CORDPA was $22, according to NNPC's spreadsheets. Rates vary seasonally and for most of the year these levels had been $35 to about $50 a tonne. NNPC paid up $80 and $100 for some ad hoc cargoes.And although gasoline is subsidised, the amount ordinary Nigerians pay at the pump remains higher than the set price.In its FAAC reports for 2021 and 2022, NNPC set its subsidised price at 124 naira ($0.30) per litre, but the average pump price is closer to 200 naira per litre across many states.""We should be reaping a bumper harvest but alas we are not,"" lamented one Nigerian official.(Additional reporting by Camillus Eboh in Abuja, Libby George in Lagos, Hamza Ibrahim in Kano, Tife Owolabi in Yenagoa and Anamesere Igboeroteonwu in Onitsha; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Alexander Smith)]"

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged 11 institutions a collective $710 million fine.“Finance, ultimately, depends on trust,” Gensler added. “By failing to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-records obligations, the market participants we have charged today have failed to maintain that trust.""A man checks his phone outside the Royal Exchange in London.

A record 43 states have the cash they need to weather an economic slump without having to resort to severe spending cuts or tax increases.This press release features multimedia.

A record 43 states have the cash they need to weather an economic slump without having to resort to severe spending cuts or tax increases. (Graphic: Business Wire)""States have never been in a better position to make it through a recession,"" said Emily Mandel, the study’s author. ""State policymakers seem to have learned a valuable lesson from the Great Recession, a period when tax revenue losses far outstripped savings.""The Moody's Analytics study examines how well a state’s finances can carry it through an economic downturn. Economists at Moody’s Analytics ran stress tests on all 50 states to arrive at an estimate of each state’s recessionary needs in the event of a moderate recession. The study takes into account the impact of the business cycle on state revenues and spending over two fiscal years.While the stress test results find most states prepared for a recession, there is some variation in their degrees of readiness, according to the study. In total, 39 states have the funds to significantly reduce stress from a recession. Four states would have to raise taxes or cut spending by less than 5% of their budgets. However, seven states would have to resort to spending cuts or tax increases of more than 5% of their budgets.States overly dependent on tourism and consumer spending will be most hard hit during a recession, according to the study. States with agriculture and energy-based economies are better positioned to weather the storm.Story continuesThe bottom five states with less than a 10% revenue gap are:IllinoisAlaskaArizonaMississippiNew HampshireIn contrast, the states most flush with cash are:North DakotaWyomingIdahoCaliforniaDelawareTo protect their budgets from increased volatility and fiscal drag, state and local policymakers should consider investing in their budget processes and make stress-testing a higher priority. ""States may want to consider formulating targeted reserve levels,"" Mandel added. ""Planning for a recession requires putting away enough money today to prepare for a future downturn, without stunting economic growth.""Read the state stress test study.About Moody’s AnalyticsMoody’s Analytics provides financial intelligence and analytical tools to help business leaders make better, faster decisions.

While yearly listing price growth remained in the double-digits in September (+13.9%), the pace continued to moderate, suggesting that a rise in relatively affordable for-sale homes could be in store for buyers in the final months of 2022.""Home prices have been remarkably resilient so far this year, considering the impact that inflation and climbing rates are having on buyers' budgets. Recent data does show some deceleration in listing prices, and a seasonal pull back that is typical of this time of year. On the flip side, this cooling is likely one reason why fewer sellers entered the market in September,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""For homeowners deciding whether to make a move this year, remember that listing prices – while lower than a few months ago – remain higher than in prior years, so you're still likely to find opportunities to cash-in on record-high levels of equity, particularly if you've owned your home for a longer period of time. And for prospective buyers grappling with affordability, you may have more bargaining power than you realize, particularly in areas where time on market is rising.""September 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Sept. 2021Change over Sept. 2019 Median listing price13.9% (to $427,000)36.7 %Active listings26.9 %-40.2 %New listings-9.8 %-11.6 %Median days on market7 days (to 50 days)-16 days Inventory improvements hold steady even as new sellers hit pauseThe U.S. supply of active listings remained higher than last year in September, but improvements failed to accelerate over last month as newly listed homes continued to drop. With higher rates resulting in less demand and fewer home sales, seller sentiment continues to decline and impact homeowner plans to list. Still, today's buyers have significantly more options than during the worst of the inventory crunch of the previous two years. This is especially true in many southern and western markets, where competition has cooled compared to the COVID frenzy.Story continuesNationally, the inventory of homes actively for sale on a typical day in September increased 26.9% (+155,000) year-over-year, holding on par with the August pace (+26.9%). Newly-listed homes were down 9.8% year-over-year, a slight improvement over last month's rate of decline (-13.0%).Compared to last year, inventory increased in 36 out of 50 of the largest metros, led by markets in the West (+64.2%) and South (+57.5%): Phoenix (+167.3%), Raleigh, N.C. (+166.1) and Nashville, Tenn. (+125.3%).In September, active listings dropped year-over-year in just one region, the Northeast (-6.0%). New listings declined from September 2021 levels in all four regions, led by the Northeast (-17.2%) and followed by the Midwest (-14.0%), West (-12.2%) and South (-3.9%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, just eight saw the number of new sellers increase over September 2021 levels: New Orleans (+119.3% as last year was impacted by Hurricane Ida), Nashville. (+19.6%), Tampa, Fla. (+9.2%), Dallas (+9.1%), Birmingham, Ala. (+6.1%), Houston (+3.6%), San Antonio (+2.9%) and Raleigh (+2.0%).Home price growth continues to moderate but remains in the double-digitsIn September, national home listing prices increased at a faster September pace than in any prior year in our data's history, despite continuing to moderate from June's peak growth rate. Driven by the combination of still-high listing prices and climbing mortgage rates, a typical monthly mortgage payment was 70% higher in September compared to a year ago. As a result of these cost pressures, recent home sales data indicates that some home shoppers are putting plans on pause, giving those who remained in the market more power to negotiate price reductions in September.The U.S. median listing price was $427,000, up 13.9% year-over-year. However, listing prices declined from June's peak median ($449,000) and annual growth rate (+18.2%).Nationally, the share of homes having their price reduced grew to 19.5% from 11.0% last September, and also climbed higher than typical 2017 and 2019 levels (18.7%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, southern and midwestern markets (+11.8%, on average) led the charge in yearly listing price growth in September, with the biggest increases registered in Miami (+28.3%), Memphis, Tenn. (+27.3%), and Milwaukee (+27.0%). Listing prices declined in just two markets: New Orleans (-2.3%) and Pittsburgh (-0.8%).Western metros posted the biggest gains in the share of listings with price reductions, led by Phoenix (+32.3 percentage points), Austin, Texas (+27.4 percentage points) and Las Vegas(+20.0 percentage points).Time on market remains higher than last year but is still historically-fast In September, a typical home spent more days on market than last year, after first hitting that milestone just last month. As inventory continues to rise this fall compared to last year, homebuyers have relatively more breathing room to make decisions. This was true of September time on market trends nationwide, as well as in all four regions and in the vast majority of U.S. metros. However, compared to historical norms in prior years, homes continue to sell at a faster pace so far in 2022.The typical U.S. home spent 50 days on the market in September, up seven days year-over-year compared to an annual increase of four days in August, which marked the first increase since the early days of COVID. Nonetheless, time on market was still 18 days faster than the typical September 2017-2019 pace.Homes spent longer on the market than last year across regions: The West, up 10 days; the South, up six days; the Northeast, up five days; and the Midwest, up five days.Relative to the national pace, time on market slowed similarly across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average, up seven days year-over-year to a median of 43 days. Among these markets, the biggest yearly time on market increases were in Austin (+23 days), Raleigh (+23 days), Phoenix (+17 days) and Las Vegas (+17 days).In September, homes sold more quickly than last year in just five metros: New Orleans (-9 days, again reflecting the impact of Hurricane Ida last year), Richmond, Va.

(""Align"") (Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign system of clear aligners, iTero intraoral scanners, and exocad CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today introduced Invisalign Virtual Care AI, its next generation remote monitoring solution with new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities that streamline workflows for doctors and their staff. It includes features such as patient enrollment, setup, and review directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site without the need to use separate standalone solutions. Invisalign Virtual Care AI helps doctors remotely monitor Invisalign treatment progress based on their own pre-approved clinical settings and AI-assisted algorithms for Automatic Assessment calibrated to each doctor’s ClinCheck treatment features. AI-assisted Automated Notifications, based on doctor settings, guide patients to either advance to the next aligner stage if their treatment is tracking well or to stay on their current stage for longer or to contact their doctor if their treatment is not tracking.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220928006013/en/AI-assisted Automated Notifications are delivered to patients through the My Invisalign App in ~1 hour based on doctor settings. (Photo: Business Wire)Invisalign Virtual Care AI builds on the MedTech Breakthrough award winning Invisalign Virtual Care platform launched in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to help Invisalign doctors connect with patients remotely through the My Invisalign App to monitor treatment progress, and ensure continuity of care of patients during Invisalign treatment. It offers several software features to create a seamless and intelligent, single-platform experience. Part of the Invisalign Virtual Care AI solution is the AI-assisted Automated Notifications (Virtual Care 3.0) feature which is a registered medical device in some countries.Story continues""Align is committed to continuous innovation in digital orthodontics and I am very excited about our next generation AI-assisted remote monitoring solution,"" said Raj Pudipeddi, Align Technology chief product and marketing officer, executive vice president and managing director, Asia Pacific. ""Invisalign Virtual Care AI is the only doctor-directed AI-assisted remote monitoring solution in the market that integrates with the Align Digital Platform, enabling doctors to prioritize Invisalign treatment tracking exceptions. It creates a seamless and intelligent, single-platform experience for Invisalign doctors and their staff through integration with the Invisalign Doctor Site, without the need for a separate portal and login, or expensive third-party workarounds. In addition, since it’s part of the Align Digital Platform and integrated with ClinCheck software, it incorporates attributes from the approved treatment plan into the assessment, such as tooth type, size, shape, etc. Further, it automatically assesses patient-submitted photos through our My Invisalign App, sending instructions back to patients on their smartphone in as little as one hour.""""Invisalign Virtual Care AI is another great example of how we are using digital technology to connect doctors and their patients to facilitate even greater continuity of care and deliver a streamlined experience,"" said Dr. Mitra Derakhshan, Align senior vice president, global clinical. ""Aligner fit and seating are important clinical indicators of Invisalign treatment progress tracking and compliance. The AI-assisted Automatic Assessment algorithms measure and highlight aligner spaces, based on doctor approved settings, and AI-assisted Automated Notifications inform patients on actions such as whether to advance to the next stage, stay on their current stage, or contact their doctor for further instructions. These AI-assisted technologies integrated with human confirmation enable practices to prioritize Invisalign treatment tracking exceptions.""""I initially began using Invisalign Virtual Care at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure continuity of care for my Invisalign patients,"" said Dr. David R. Boschken, an orthodontist and Align Technology Global Faculty member located in Los Altos, California. ""The new AI-assisted algorithms in Invisalign Virtual Care AI have elevated the remote monitoring experience for me and my patients. Automatic Assessment provides me with objective measurement of aligner spaces, the single most important indicator of Invisalign treatment tracking in my practice, while Automated Notifications advise patients of their progress in less than one hour, which in turn enables me to focus on treatment tracking exceptions. And since Invisalign Virtual Care AI is integrated with the Align Digital Platform, I don’t have to log into a separate portal or use third party remote monitoring services. This efficiency has enabled me to save chair time and expand the geographic reach of my practice. It has given me the confidence to enroll over 1,000 of my Invisalign patients into Invisalign Virtual Care AI, from teens and young adults to seniors – this is the new way to follow Invisalign treatments for orthodontic practices.""""Invisalign Virtual Care AI has transformed how I follow the treatment progress of my Invisalign patients,"" said Dr. Jan Einfeldt, a GP dentist located in Kent, United Kingdom. ""Tooth movement using Invisalign clear aligners is often the first step in a smile makeover, which may require a combination of procedures such as implants, veneers and crowns, so it is critical to keep treatment progress on track. By using my pre-approved preferences and automatically integrating attributes of my approved ClinCheck treatment plan, such as tooth type, shape, size, pontics, etc., the AI algorithms help determine aligner fit and advise patients to advance to the next aligner tray or stay on their current tray for longer to ensure the desired movements take effect. Invisalign Virtual Care AI is now the gold standard of follow up across all procedures in my practice that include Invisalign treatment.""AI-assisted Remote Monitoring Fully Integrated with the Align Digital PlatformInvisalign Virtual Care AI is integrated with the Align Digital Platform, which includes the Invisalign Doctor Site, ClinCheck treatment plans, and the My Invisalign App. No separate portal or login is required since remote monitoring is managed directly on the Invisalign Doctor Site, which benefits doctors and their staff. Similarly, patients can use their My Invisalign App without the need to download a separate app for remote monitoring.AI-assisted Photo Capture: Easy capture of clinically relevant photos via the My Invisalign App for patients with a next-generation user interface and intelligent real-time photo guidance. Patients send photos with every aligner change and receive progress notifications on their My Invisalign App. No separate remote monitoring app is required.AI-assisted Automatic Assessment*: Automatic assessment measures and highlights the size of aligner spaces based on doctor settings.Objective and doctor-directed: AI uses each doctor’s settings to objectively measure aligner spaces. Doctors can customize settings at a clinic level or for individual patients.Personalized and integrated with ClinCheck treatment plan attributes: Virtual Care AI assessment automatically integrates tooth type, shape, and size from the doctor-approved ClinCheck treatment plan.Tooth-specific detail: Aligner spaces are measured and highlighted individually for each tooth. This enables doctors to quickly hone-in on problem areas where teeth do not correctly fit into the tray. Any exceptions to treatment progress, such as aligner fit or a tooth that is not moving as expected are flagged for doctor review, helping ensure patient treatments are being monitored between in-office visits.AI-assisted Automated Notification: Automated Notifications are delivered to patients through the My Invisalign App in ~1 hour based on doctor settings. Patients are instructed to advance to the next tray if their treatment is tracking well, or to stay on their current aligner or to contact their doctor if their treatment is off track. Automated notifications enable practices to prioritize patients review.The Invisalign Virtual Care AI remote monitoring solution is in active global rollout to Invisalign trained doctors with availability beginning in certain markets in APAC, EMEA and Americas. Doctors should check with their Align sales representative for information specific to their market and product availability. For more information, they can also visit the ‘Virtual Care’ tab on their Invisalign Doctor Site.*AI assessment results are reviewed by Align-trained personnel prior to Automated Notification being sent to ensure assessment is consistent with doctor’s settings.About Align Digital PlatformThe Align Digital Platform is an integrated suite of unique, proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless, end-to-end experience and workflow that connects users.About Align Technology, Inc.Align Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign® system, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero® intraoral scanners and services, and exocad® CAD/CAM software.

68,62e5a86a-7cd0-3f9f-a6c3-c7d9e1d713c4,MRO,2022-09-29,Investors Heavily Search Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-marathon-oil-130001053.html,1664370001,STORY,['MRO'],"[Marathon Oil (MRO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this energy company have returned -16.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Marathon Oil belongs, has lost 15.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Oil is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of +218% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.81 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +206.4%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.35 indicates a change of -9.7% from what Marathon Oil is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marathon Oil is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Oil, the consensus sales estimate of $2.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +46.5%. The $8.29 billion and $7.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +51.6% and -11%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Oil reported revenues of $2.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +101.5%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $0.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.87%. The EPS surprise was +7.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Oil is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Oil. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(screenshot/Netflix)Netflix and Disney are the latest platforms to hop on the ad-tier bandwagon, with the latter aiming to officially launch its ad option Dec. 8.Netflix recently announced two senior hires in its own efforts to roll out an ad-supported tier next year, although recent messaging signaled that the company may be moving up the launch to Nov. 1 to get ahead of Disney's timeline.Story continuesThe ad-supported version will cost between $7 and $9 a month, according to Bloomberg, with the company planning to play four minutes of ads for every hour of content.Netflix is looking to charge advertisers roughly $65 for reaching 1,000 viewers (a measure otherwise known as CPM or ""cost per thousand""), WSJ previously reported. That charge is significantly higher than most other streaming competitors.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Sept. 28, 2022Tech's ugly summer will get worse before it gets betterThe third quarter will, mercifully, come to an end Friday, closing out a trainwreck for big names in the tech industry as fears of a recession, changing consumer appetites, a broader bear market, and supply chain snarls conspired against the once-hot sector.Shares of Big Tech companies have collapsed. Year-to-date Meta (META) is down 59%, while Nvidia is down 58%. Amazon (AMZN) is off 31%, same as Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) is down 29%. The only firms outpacing the broader S&amp;P 500 — which is off 22% — are Tesla (TSLA), which is down 21%, and Apple, down 15%.“It’s the most negative as I’ve seen tech going back to 2009,” Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Monday, noting that investors are shying away from riskier investments like tech.But long-term tech investors shouldn’t lose hope, especially if consumer demand for products like Apple’s iPhones and cloud computing orders for companies like Microsoft hold pace. And while we could see ugly earnings reports in October, tech companies could start to bounce back by the new year.Tough going for everyone but Apple and TeslaHow did we get here? While life has returned to normal for most people, the shocks the pandemic sent through the economy continue to reverberate with some of the highest inflation we’ve seen in decades.The Federal Reserve is responding by driving interest rates ever higher. In turn, a strengthening dollar is also hurting companies’ sales abroad, with many firms reporting foreign exchange rates as a major pain point in their last earnings reports. These macroeconomic factors took a particular toll on tech companies specializing in discretionary items as consumers pulled back from making purchases.Story continuesTo say it was a difficult quarter for tech companies is an understatement. And while they’re all getting hit by inflation and rising interest rates, it’s showing through in different ways.Nvidia has seen sales of its graphics cards drop, as PC sales falter. (Photo via Getty Images)Chip companies, for instance, saw demand for semiconductors fall amid declines in PC sales. Ahead of its second quarter earnings, Nvidia (NVDA) announced it would miss its prior projections as gaming sales dried up. According to the company's numbers, gaming segment revenue dropped an eye-watering 33% year-over-year in the quarter and 44% compared to the first quarter. Worse still, Nvidia missed street expectations for its third-quarter forecast, saying it will bring in $5.9 billion rather than the $6.9 billion analysts had expected.Intel took a similar hit as PC sales fell, and Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM revenue, the money it brings in from sales of Windows to PC makers, fell 2% year over year. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, took a hit thanks to a decline in PC and server chips. The company is projecting 2022 year-end revenue will be $11 billion lower than it initially expected.Meanwhile, ad-supported tech companies like Meta and Snap (SNAP) have been hurt by Apple’s (AAPL) privacy changes that prevent apps from tracking their users’ activity across the web. That and slowing ad sales amid the current economic climate, resulted in Meta’s first ever year-over-year revenue decline, dropping by 1%. Snap hasn’t done much better, announcing layoffs and cuts to products like its drone camera.Amazon, for its part, is trying to correct itself after over-expanding its e-commerce division to deal with the crush of orders during the height of the pandemic. And while it beat on revenue expectations in the second quarter, and surpassed third-quarter projections, there’s no telling how a slowing economy could impact overall sales.Some companies, however, have continued to perform surprisingly well. Not only did Apple beat analysts’ expectations on revenue and earnings in the second quarter, but it also set a quarterly revenue record as well. Tesla, meanwhile, met revised expectations for the quarter, and announced that June was its highest vehicle production month yet.It’s not all doom and gloomThere are other bright spots in tech, chiefly in the cloud space. While Microsoft’s Windows OEM division was slapped in the quarter, its cloud business did incredibly well. The company missed analysts’ expectations on overall revenue, but its Intelligent Cloud revenue was up 40% year over year. Nvidia, meanwhile, saw its Data Center business revenue jump 61% in the quarter.Apple CEO Tim Cook welcomes customers outside the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)“Fundamentally, enterprise tech has held up well, as budgets and spending are not tapering off given the massive spending allocated to cloud and digital transformation projects,” said Ives. “That said, the softer economy is now front and center and we would expect [foreign exchange] and macro headwinds to be a key theme during tech earnings season in October. The stocks are reflecting a lot of bad news and the Street will breathe a sigh of relief if demand holds through the rest of the year in the beaten-down tech sector.”Demand for Apple’s new iPhone 14 line is also holding steady compared to the iPhone 13, and with the Pro devices getting the biggest push, that could bode well for sales in the coming quarters.Companies are also committed to investments despite the economic downturn. During Intel’s Innovation conference on Tuesday, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is continuing to move forward with its plans to build out chip foundries and is dedicated to its move into the graphics chip market.The coming holiday season will be an incredibly important time for the industry as analysts and investors look for hints as to how everyone from consumers to advertisers are spending their cash. And with luck, that could point to improvements heading into next year.“Once things settle down I think you'll see tech companies be some of the biggest and fastest gainers,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell said. “The hard part is predicting when that will be, but I'm hopeful for the first quarter of 2023.”By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.SAP has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Microsoft has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that SAP's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.SAP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.15, while MSFT has a forward P/E of 23.44. We also note that SAP has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MSFT currently has a PEG ratio of 2.Another notable valuation metric for SAP is its P/B ratio of 2.05. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MSFT has a P/B of 10.59.These metrics, and several others, help SAP earn a Value grade of B, while MSFT has been given a Value grade of C.SAP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MSFT, so it seems like value investors will conclude that SAP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.89 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.19%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this payroll processor and human-resources services provider would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of 2.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Paychex , which belongs to the Zacks Outsourcing industry, posted revenues of $1.21 billion for the quarter ended August 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.08 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Paychex shares have lost about 17% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -23.5%.What's Next for Paychex?While Paychex has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Paychex: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

(Operator Instructions) Please note this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Gretchen, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal '23 earnings release. Joining me today are John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. I do want to start out by saying that all of us are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Ian that is approaching Florida at this time. Certainly, our employees, our clients and everyone else in those areas, we hope are safe. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And this teleconference is, of course, being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available for approximately 90 days. We'll start today's call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will then review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and then we'll open it up for your questions. I will start out by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call as -- in my role as CEO of Paychex. On August 24, we announced I'm retiring as CEO effective October 14. That's after our 2022 -- fiscal 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, I will remain in my role as Chairman of the Board. John Gibson, on the call today, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO. John has been a member of the executive leadership team since 2013 and has been instrumental in the success of Paychex during his tenure. We have executed on a long-term succession plan, and I'm confident that John is the right person to lead Paychex into its next phase of growth. Really many best days ahead of us. I want to thank all of you also, you directly, for your interest in coverage of Paychex, some of you for more than 2 decades and for your good questions and feedback over my 12 years as Chief Executive Officer. I also want to publicly thank Efrain. Everyone knows he's one of the best CFOs in the business, and we've done over 40 quarterly calls together. And more than any -- more than a CFO, Efrain has really been a leader on our executive team and who provides not only great counsel, but is known for his intelligence, his integrity and also music trivia. You can try that out on some time. Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start with a double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings compared to the same quarter last year. We have a record level of first quarter sales with strong trends continuing in the mid-market, retirement and HR outsourcing in particular. We have had continued success in the selling of our suite of innovative products from HCM technology to HR solutions that help businesses become more efficient and address complex HR issues in a challenging time for many businesses. We continue to regularly monitor our key leading indicators for signs of changes to the macroeconomic trends. And while we have seen some moderation in key issues, we have not yet seen any significant changes. As an example, the latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch showed that workers of U.S. small businesses continue to benefit from higher wages. New jobs continue to grow but at a more moderated pace, and job growth at U.S. small businesses remains resilient even in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Employment levels at our existing clients have continued to increase as they're finding more people to fill those positions, consistent with these findings of our HR -- of our Small Business Index. I will now turn the call over to John, and he will provide you with some highlights surrounding our technology and product suite and results. John? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you. Based upon our recently released Pulse of HR survey, it's obvious that businesses of all sizes continue to be challenged with attracting and retaining talent, improving their operational efficiency and working to increase their financial flexibility. Our continued investments in innovative HR technology, combined with our unmatched HR expertise, truly and uniquely positions us to help small businesses and mid-sized businesses navigate a very dynamic and challenging environment. Earlier this month, we attended the annual HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, where once again, Paychex demonstrated the latest of our innovations. We showcased significant enhancements to the Paychex Flex recruiting and applicant tracking experience, which is designed to digitally deliver candidates to clients faster and allow them to leverage mobile technology to recruit, screen and then onboard candidates in a unified and simple-to-use experience. Already, our digital onboarding experience was utilized by over 1.7 million new hires in the last year alone. We also introduced our latest innovation, Paychex Voice Assist. And really, this is a natural extension of the expansive and ever-growing and utilized self-service capabilities that we have at Paychex. And coupled with our award-winning Paychex Pre-Check offering, which allows employees to further participate in the payroll process by reviewing their gross to net payroll calculations prior to payroll processing, Paychex Voice Assist now enables HR and payroll administrators and small business owners to manage their payroll and HR tasks while on the go through any Google Assistant-capable device. This provides a hands-free experience that includes voice recognition and verification security. I'm proud that Paychex is the first HCM solutions provider to offer voice-activated capabilities such as these. Our technology offerings continue to garner national recognition. Paychex is proud to be recognized for the sixth, I repeat, the sixth, consecutive year by NelsonHall, a global analyst and research firm, and it positioned us as a leader in its 2002 (sic) [2022] NEAT report for service providers. Paychex Flex was recognized for its comprehensive technology as one of the most advanced HR platforms that brings the power of benchmarking, data analytics as well as digital service enablement to drive operational efficiency and improve the employee experience. I also want to mention that we have once again, for the 12th consecutive year, been recognized as the nation's largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine. We were also recognized by them as an industry leader in the number of new plans that we added in 2021. It's obvious that our retirement business continues to be an area of strength for us as many business owners and their employees are focused on financial wellness as a key benefit and issue. In addition, our Pooled Employer Plan offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace with approximately 4,000 new plans onboarded during the first quarter alone. We continue to see strong demand for our Employee Retention Tax Credit service. This helps clients maximize their eligible tax credits and thus, provide them more financial flexibility. To date, we have helped over 45,000 clients secure over $8.6 billion, that's $8.6 billion, in combined ERTC and paid leave tax credits. We continue to have the opportunity to educate more of our existing clients on the benefit of this service as well as leverage the service to attract new clients. We have started off the fiscal year '23 strong. And while there is uncertainty in the macro environment, our solutions and business model have in the past and continue today to prove their resilience. We help our clients to succeed under any macroeconomic conditions. We continue to focus our product road map on the needs of our clients and anticipate releasing further enhancements this fiscal year designed to continue to provide them a positive digital user experience and help them utilize HR technology to simplify their processes. Now before I turn the call over to Efrain, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you, and yes, Marty, you're going to continue to hear this over and over again over the next couple of weeks. But I want to say thank you to Marty for his tireless dedication and strong leadership of the company over the years. And for me, personally, for his mentorship and his friendship for the nearly decade that he and I have been working together. Under Marty's tenure as CEO, Paychex has more than doubled its revenue and transformed into a leading HCM technology solutions company. Today, Paychex is a tech company, and it's a tech company because of Marty's vision and his leadership. Marty, it's been a pleasure to work alongside you, the leadership team and the nearly 17,000 now employees of Paychex, and I look forward to continuing our relationship in our new roles. As I've said many times and to many people, we're the same great company. It's the same great leadership team. It's the same great employees. We're just each playing a little different roles as we move forward. I know that our collective focus on our purpose, which is to help small and mid-sized businesses succeed, will continue to drive us in the future as it has in the past. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to discuss our first quarter financials. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, therefore, involve risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing key points for the quarter and finish with a review of fiscal 2023 outlook. As Marty and John already mentioned, Q1 was strong. Our financial results for the first quarter included service revenue and total revenue that increased 11% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 12% to $906 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration; HR ancillary services, largely our ERTC product; and price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I'll note that the revenue from our ERTC service benefited our first quarter revenue by about 1% to 2%. While we had anticipated ERTC revenue would continue in fiscal 2023, strong execution both in sales and service allowed us to realize some of the revenue a bit earlier in the year. While ERTC was a tailwind to growth for the first quarter, its benefit will decline as the year progresses. For the full year, the impact will be marginal to growth. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $283 million driven by growth in average worksite employees and PEO health insurance revenue. The rate of growth was tempered by a lower rate of health insurance enrollment in both the PEO and the insurance agency, together with continued softness in workers' compensation rates. So that really is a little bit more focused that the insurance agency has more of an impact on the revenue there. Interest on funds held for clients increased 24% for the quarter to $18 million primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 11% to $711 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general cost to support growth in our business. In addition, PEO direct costs increased due to higher medical plan enrollments compared to the same period last year. Op income increased 12% to $496 million with an operating margin of 41.1%, an expansion of 20 basis points over the prior year, a bit above where we anticipated it being in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. Both periods reflect discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp payments. However, the prior year also reflected an increase in state taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 14% to $379 million and $1.05 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% for the quarter to $372 million and $1.03 per share, respectively. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, and our borrowings are at approximately $800 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $364 million during the first quarter, a small decrease from the prior driven by fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income. And we paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $285 million in the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 46%. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first quarter results and our view of the evolving macroeconomic landscape. One thing I want to emphasize as I walk through the guidance. We don't provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. What we try to do is give you a sense of where we anticipate the quarters will fall. So I'd ask that you keep that in mind. The majority of our guidance remains unchanged from that provided in June with the exception of an increase in our expected growth for adjusted earnings per share. Let me provide some color in certain areas as follows. Management Solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, but now we anticipate it to be towards the upper end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is still expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, but we now anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, but is now again anticipated to be towards the upper end of the range. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, but again, based on what I just said, is anticipated to be towards the upper end of that range. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 11% to 12%, increase from the previous guidance of 9% to 10%. I just want everyone to remember, I'm talking about adjusted diluted earnings per share. So turning to the second quarter. Our current thoughts are that we anticipate revenue growth will be approximately 7%, and we expect operating margins to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which could change if there are significant changes to the macro environment. We will update you again on the second quarter call, and I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. I'd also like to take a moment to thank you -- say thank you to Marty for his years of service to the company. It's been an incredible pleasure working alongside you, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I can say that for all of the shareholders on the call, there was never a moment, never a conversation where putting the interest of shareholders didn't come first. And so I know that, that will continue under John's leadership. So -- the other thing I'd like to say is that the company that we're reporting on today simply would not be where it is today without Marty's efforts. And one other thing that I want to add, too. For the investors on the call, we filed a supplemental proxy statement this week relating to our say-on-pay proposal. We'd ask that investors who want a position in Paychex take a look, read that closely. I'm always available. The management team is always available for any calls that you'd like to schedule to discuss that. So with that, let me turn it back over to Marty. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, John and Efrain. Thank you very much for the comments and for your updates. And also, of course, we wouldn't be here where we are today at the company without our over 16,000 employees, who have worked so tirelessly for our clients and for our shareholders. We'll now open it up for your questions and comments. Gretchen, please open it up, please. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bryan C. Bergin, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marty, John, congrats. I wanted to start here if we can talk about really thinking a little bit more around the moderation comment you mentioned on some of the KPIs, and any changed view on macro assumptions in that fiscal '23 guide, particularly on client employee levels and retention? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I don't think so. I'll let John comment, too. But I think what we're seeing in the moderation is like on retention, I think that we're kind of heading back towards -- we're still above -- from a revenue retention standpoint, we're still above pre-pandemic levels. On a client retention, we're kind of normalizing back to a pre-pandemic. We kind of expected that. There was a lot of new business growth, new start-up business growth over the last couple of years during the pandemic. And so you're seeing a few more of those go out of business, and you're seeing a few more bankruptcies that way. And the other thing that we're seeing in the small business index is while wages are going up, they're starting to slow down and moderate. So while job growth is still growing and moderating some for small businesses, wage growth is starting to moderate slightly. So that's maybe a good sign that some of the actions being taken by the Fed are working, and maybe that will continue to improve. But other than that, sales continue to be very strong. So when you look at that side of it, we're at record levels of sales. We had a great first quarter in sales, and clients are adding employees. So the moderation is probably more on the retention side normalizing and -- but the number of employees being added and the sales are still very strong. John, anything you want to add? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, I would say I don't think there's anything we're seeing at this point that we'd see as a sign of a recession. As Marty pointed out, there's -- there was moderation that we expected going into this year on the retention because of the business charge. But when I look at it, employment levels continue to be -- increase. We see that in our checks. We see that in worksite employees per customer. The labor market continues to be tight. Our business watch certainly showed that information. I would also point to our revenue retention is remaining at the record levels we've seen before. So again, we continue to see the fact that retention and the use of our products, when I look at the underlying pieces, clients are taking high-value services from us. Those things are creating more stickiness for those customers that are. Our price value losses continue to remain significantly below even the pre-pandemic level. So again, any moderation that we're seeing, I view is more of a normalization of what we kind of saw as an anomaly going on during the pandemic. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bryan C. Bergin, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD &amp; Analyst [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Okay. And then just, Efrain, for the 2Q rough targets that you provided here, can you just talk -- dig in a little bit more on the dynamics, first on growth as we think about moving from 1Q to 2Q? And then just on margin, too. You had outperformance on margin in 1Q. Are there added investments that come back into the model over the course of the year, particularly in 2Q? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, a little bit. So let me just (inaudible) that because obviously, the growth rate in Q2 is a little bit different. This year was always a little odd because the 2 highest growth quarters were the first and the last and in the middle for different reasons, a little bit idiosyncratic to the processing for our plan process ended up a little bit lower. In Q2, I'd call out 3 things, Bryan, that are important. We don't anticipate that the level of ERTC, I called it out in the quarter, will -- the amount of growth contributed by ERTC will continue in the second quarter. Having said that, I don't know because I didn't think that was going to happen in the first quarter. So we could be a little bit more. But I'm being a little bit cautious about what we think we will get. So you won't quite get -- you won't get that level of uptick in growth in Q2. And these comments are about Q2, by the way. We'll talk about the back half of the year when we get a little bit closer to the back half of the year. The second part is that we had, to the point, although there's been discussion about moderation, what was really interesting in the first quarter is that we had higher growth in what we'd call check volume and pays per control, others call, than we anticipated in our plan. The first quarter was actually fairly robust. Out of an abundance of caution, reading the same info you are reading, we think we're still going to get some benefit in Q2, but it won't be as pronounced as it was in the first quarter. So that will cause a little bit of a step down. And then with respect to PEO, we called out some trends that are persisting with around -- PEO insurance around health care attachment that we think will continue into second quarter. That's going to drive growth a bit smaller or a bit lower than we were. We're really consistent, in some ways, a little bit above with what I said when we were in the fourth quarter call. That's really what's driving it. It really is more of a Q2 (inaudible) investment side. The challenge for this year was we entered the year -- we were -- in the first half of the year last year, we were really at much lower employment levels than we are currently, and so as you have a little bit of a step down in revenue in Q2 -- whereas you have a step down in revenue in Q2, you still have a relatively higher expense level that normalize as we get into the back half of the year. And then we're making investments in marketing, product development, the normal things that you would make in a quarter. And that combines to kind of create a little bit of a lumpy Q2. So that -- those are the key factors in terms of underlying dynamics. No change, and it's pretty much in line with what we anticipated. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Alan Kupferberg, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in US Equity Research &amp; Senior Analyst [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, first of all, congrats to Marty and John. I did want to start with a question for Efrain. Just on the EPS guidance raise, Efrain, is this just because you now think revenue and margin will both be at the higher end of your full year expectations? I know everything else is kind of unchanged, so just want to make sure we have the pieces there for EPS. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I think for the full year, we'll be a little bit ahead, I'd say. I think it's more driven, Jason, by more mix. So there's some revenue component to it, and there's a mix component to it that's driving the EPS number. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Alan Kupferberg, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in US Equity Research &amp; Senior Analyst [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Okay. Got it. The -- just the float income guidance for fiscal '23, I know it's unchanged. You're talking about being at the higher end. I guess maybe just given the magnitude and the speed of the Fed rate hikes, can you walk through some of the pieces there? Some people, I think, might have thought that, that number would be moving a bit higher. But obviously, there's portfolio duration and other variables to consider. Yes, that would be helpful. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason, thank you. That -- so look, I'm a little bit cautious, and I think we could be accused of some conservatism there. But you're absolutely right. And just to get one level deeper and get a little bit more into the question that you're raising, I think that the issue for us is at what point do you see the Fed raising and then you lock long based on duration? I don't have the great answer to that. I will say we're meeting basically every other week to decide what our outlook is on that. That could impact that number. I'm looking not only at '23 and '24. You were here long enough to know when we rode that cycle up and then had a bumpy cycle on the way down. And so I want to avoid that even at the expense of maybe a little bit of upside this year. So we're trying to figure all that out. And then we're -- you're reading the same thing. Actually, you have better info than I do. One second, it looks like short-term interests are going to go to X., and the next second, someone says, ""Hey, I'm a little bit concerned about that."" That could cause a recession. So balancing all of that with the appropriate level of conservatism so that we can hit what we said, we feel good about the forecast at this stage based on what we know is a little bit trickier. We're certainly at the high end of that range, and we'll update next quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Alan Kupferberg, BofA Securities, Research Division - MD in US Equity Research &amp; Senior Analyst [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Just one last quick one. Just in that -- picking up on that theme of potential conservatism. I mean, just looking at Management Solutions, obviously, you're sticking with 5% to 7% for the year. You started at 12%. You had some of the ERTC benefit, but it just seems like a lot of decel kind of baked in. So maybe you want to talk through that a little bit. I know you're talking about higher end, but still. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. I'd say this. I think -- and we'll talk more as we get to kind of mid-year. I think one of the things that ends up happening with ERTC in the back half of the year, it becomes a headwind to growth because it doesn't recur in the same way that the revenues do. So we baked that in. That's one. We're against tough comps in the back half of the year. So that's another issue. And then employment is really the other part that we're wondering about. Right now, I'd say we're not assuming that there's a lot of employee adds in the back half of the year. Could we see something that's different than that? I don't know, both ways. At this point, I can't call it close enough. So I'm sticking with where we thought we were going to be at the beginning of the year, and then we'll update as we go through the year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Owen Nicholas, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wanted to start on the PEO and Insurance Services segment. Obviously, growth came in on the bottom end of the full year range. You're now guiding to kind of lower end of the range for the full year. I know you mentioned some weakness in the insurance business this quarter. Is there anything else to call out within that business that surprised you, whether it was the upside or the downside? It sounds like existing clients' hiring activities are still quite strong. Sales are good. So just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics there as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let me frame it, and then I'll let John talk to it. He's obviously well-versed in what's going on in terms of the dynamics of the business. In terms of the plan and forecast and our guidance, we started out the year a little bit lower on the insurance side than we had anticipated. That's primarily an issue around -- and we called it out, on enrollments. We think that trend will persist into the second quarter, and then it will start to improve as we get into the back half of the year. So we have a little bit lower first half than originally anticipated and in the back half as we expected. So that's what's really kind of moving the PEO numbers down in terms of our outlook. Look, you know, Andrew, better than most. Differences in attachment can change revenues really, really quickly. And so we'll see where we end up on that front as we go through the year. It's driving it. It's driving our results. Largely doesn't have a significant impact on margin, again, as you know, because those are relatively low-margin revenues. But out of a sense of, I'd say, at a sense of where we ended up in the first quarter and where we're anticipating second quarter to be, we're good. Now I'll let John talk about the fundamentals of the business because I think they actually are pretty strong. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, I feel, particularly, on the PEO side, I'll talk about that first. Like we're well positioned coming out of the first quarter. Remember, we're just now really entering the key selling season. We're also in open enrollment season within our PEOs, and those are 2 critical periods of time. When I look at where we are going into this, our client retention is extremely strong. Really, we had set some pretty aggressive targets, and we're actually beating those targets in the PEO in the first quarter, so the value proposition is resonating. So retention was very strong. Sales were strong for the first quarter. I look at where we are from a sales headcount. We actually accelerated. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we made some investments in the first quarter. Some of that was actually adding because we saw the demand there. Our tenure is great. We have the best sales retention of any of our divisions in the PEO. So our tenure of our team going into the selling season is really strong. We just completed our renewals with our health insurance carriers. I feel good about where we are on those. I think we got a good part of that. To Efrain's point, kind of the attachment of insurance and then once we attach insurance to a client, how many employees are signing up for that? Again, in particular, this might be an affordability issue that we may be seeing. So some of the things we've done is we've actually expanded low cost plans in this next enrollment. We've expanded our enrollment consultants, who will go out and engage clients. So we're working against what we've kind of seen some trends in the first quarter. But obviously, some of the drag in revenue, as Efrain said, is we had a little lower than we historically have seen relative to attachment of insurance in the PEO and a little lower participation than we've typically seen as well. And again, we've taken steps in terms of both plan design and in our sales execution to be able to move forward. The agent -- the insurance agency, some of the things we saw relative to attachment and participation in our H&amp;B area, similar to PEO, common theme there that we saw in the first quarter. And then as we've talked about, I think, repeatedly, the market -- just the market is continually soft in P&amp;C and continues to be a headwind. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Owen Nicholas, William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Analyst [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Those comments were super helpful. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. You mentioned the HR Tech Conference in your press release and I think again in the prepared remarks. And I, personally, I was impressed by the number of vendors at the conference and the level of innovation really across the sector. So with that in mind, given the number of new products, the amount of money that's come into the space over the past several years, just wondering if it's changed how you kind of think about the build versus buy equation. Does M&amp;A make more sense today, given the rate of change in the market and how rapidly new products are being built and gaining adoption? Essentially, just want to get your thoughts on build versus buy, appetite for M&amp;A, given all that's going on right now. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. This is Marty. I'll start it out. It's an interesting question. I think the appetite is still there. I think valuations are still high, but we'll see if they catch up and come down some and get more realistic. We've always been able to use M&amp;A not only for growth from a -- kind of from a product perspective, but I mean, actually adding to the technology. So time and attendance started with M&amp;A back many years ago, now 10, 11 years ago and probably 12 for the first time and attendance product, which we then built into our product and now is one of the fastest-growing products we have from that perspective. So -- but I don't think so. I think we really look at that very closely, whether we can build. We have a very successful development team here, product management and development, that kind of decide what do we have to do from a tech standpoint. We like it being bundled into the Flex product suite, and so we're careful to do an M&amp;A from a product add-on standpoint. And we don't really see -- I don't really see, and John can comment on this, too -- a product that we're missing right now in the suite that I would have to go out and -- that we would go out and look at from an M&amp;A perspective. It's more adding to what we have. The technology, we feel -- everything is, as John mentioned earlier, the HR, the HCM technology that we have, the combination with being able to do so much on the mobile. We have such a large use now of the mobile app. We're also tying much more to the employees in self-service. And so if you didn't pick up on some of that at HR Tech, self-service has become a big part of our model. That gets the employees of our clients more involved and right from just making their own changes, self-onboarding many aspects of when they sign up to Paychex Pre-Check, which allows them to view, as you know, view their payroll before its processed, has really been important to bring the client employees into the picture, which builds better retention and better love of the Paychex mobile app, which still does a 4.8 out of 5 stars. And so I don't think there's a lot of M&amp;A from a product need that we have to add to. But there's still a good appetite for M&amp;A, and we're constantly evaluating opportunities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I'd probably give you a good example that I actually talked about here on the call and one that's -- that we have previously announced and is in the works to go live. I think we're constantly looking for the right combination of partnerships, technology we can build and acquisitions that we can bolt on to kind of put a unified experience together that resonates with our customers and addresses a problem. We talked about the recruiting and applicant tracking and onboarding experience that we launched reintegrated. That's really a combination of build. We got a partnership with Indeed, which we've talked about numerous times, to help get candidates faster. And then it was also an acquisition that we made some time ago of a company on the onboarding and kind of applicant tracking side and the unification of that into Flex and using the talent that we had bought. And that's taken off tremendously. So it's a better experience. As Marty mentioned, already 1.7 million new hires have went through that process. So that's an example. Another example that we're currently in the process of, and this goes back probably to your question on the insurance agency and about us working to really get more employees participating in all of our insurance products, and that was an acquisition that we made just a little bit ago with the benefits administration and enrollment technology, found a great small little company, could add both the talent on how to design that from a user experience perspective. We're in the final stages of deploying that. And actually, that will be deployed in our agency and our PEO as an electronic mobile-enabled way for employees to enroll in benefits. And it's also going to really highlight the ancillary benefits they get. Again, this has been showing them the right plan, getting them to participate and getting them to really see the full suite of insurance we've got electronically in a unified experience. So that's in early stages of being launched as we speak right now. So there's a couple of examples of where I think we're going to continue to look for experiences we're trying to build for our clients and their employees, what capabilities do we have built in to Flex today and where can we either find partners or find tech bolt-ons that will help us improve that experience. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ramsey Clark El-Assal, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wanted to ask about the pricing environment and the degree to which you've been able to kind of pass through potentially larger price increases, given the inflationary backdrop. Should we expect a bigger contribution from pricing in this environment this year than we normally would? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. In terms of pricing, Ramsey, I think that -- I think Marty mentioned last quarter's call that we were towards the higher end of the range than of what we typically price. And I think that's where we're at right now, and that's what's holding. Look, I think we are constantly trying to strive for getting the balance between price and value correct, and I think that we're striking, at this point, the right balance on that issue. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. The price realization feels very good right now. And as John mentioned, I think it was a combination of a lot of things John is saying. So when you have that, a big need for recruiting, hiring and onboarding employees, and we're able to solve that particularly with technology, you're saving -- we're hearing more and more from the clients that they're saving operationally. They're being more effective. Therefore, the -- a little bit higher on the price range is working, and it's sticking. So discounting has really been not an issue at all. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ramsey Clark El-Assal, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Quite helpful. A follow-up for me. I wanted to ask a question on the sort of the relative resiliency of the 2 parts of your business. I'm just curious if there are drivers or factors that make Management Solutions and/or PEO sort of more cyclically sensitive relative to each other. I kind of feel like investors have a better handle on Management Solutions as it's sort of the longer-dated segment. But I'm just curious if you feel that PEO also has the sort of resiliency that you'd expect from the overall business. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I can start, and John can jump in. I think, Ramsey, definitely PEO does. Right now, all the things that John just talked about and I just mentioned, recruiting, hiring, having insurance plans that as a small or mid-sized business you might not be able to have on your own. The PEO has continued to be pretty strong. You do see fluctuations. Like we mentioned in this first quarter, we'd have quite as much enrollment, but we're also heading into the real selling season and the enrollment portion of the PEO. So PEO has continued to be very popular. And I think it is very resilient in a time when I'm competing for employees, I'm a business competing for employees, and I need better insurance plans. I need better help in signing people up for those insurance plans. And so yes, I think it has very strong resiliency just like the Management Solutions offerings. Anything you want to add to that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, look, when I look at the clients that are attracted to the PEO value proposition, these are clients that are having to navigate very complex HR or complex employment situations, multistate, they're in difficult states where there's a lot of regulatory compliance and other risks facing their business. And they view our HR support, our compliance support, the way that we assist them and EEOC type of complaints and issues as a critical part of their business. I just got a comment on this from a client, a small client, that said they couldn't live without their HR person helping them out. And I would step back and just again -- and maybe reiterate macro because maybe we're not explaining it well. You look at our employment, you look at the HR pulse survey, and I look at the -- what issues our nearly 700 HR consultants are facing for our clients. Our clients are still trying to fill open positions. So not only did we see checks and worksite employees increase, but we continue to see them asking for technology solutions, support and how can they continue to fill open positions. So certainly, what we see in the underlying macro side in both the managed solutions and the PEO is that they're really needing our HR support. It's a complex environment, and I think there's good resiliency going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ramsey Clark El-Assal, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. So similar performance profile through the cycle for both segments is what I got from that. So I appreciate your answer. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eugene M. Simuni, MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So I wanted to come back for a second to macro. I'm hearing loud and clear what you guys are saying that you're not seeing any signs of recession slowdown in the employment numbers and still a very tight labor market. That's clear. I wanted to ask about a slightly different metric, which is, let's say, businesses' willingness to invest in new technology, right? So situations where you would get real upgrades, feature additions or maybe switching from a legacy provider to you guys, things like that. I'm curious if you're seeing any incremental caution across your small business customers on that even as performance remains strong as people just get more cautious looking ahead. And if not, then, in your experience running this company for a long time, when times get a little bit more volatile, can we expect that caution to increase? And why? Why not? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I would say at this point, we're not seeing that yet because, in fact, in a time like this, they're trying to -- the biggest things -- John talked about some of the surveys we've been doing lately. It's about operating efficiency. It's about how do I fill these positions. So the demand is still there for their products. And -- at this stage of the macro, and so they're needing people, and they're needing technology to save them money in other ways because wages are up. They have to give more benefits. So they're actually, I think, in this kind of environment, and it's been this way as the market has been tight, small and mid-sized businesses need to offer better benefits. They need to offer more technology. They need to have a mobile app like ours that you can deal with remote workforces. So actually, I don't think that has -- there hasn't -- they haven't gotten any more skittish, I guess, I'd say about investing. They're actually really needed at this stage of the game. And typically, in -- depending on what kind of macro environment you're in, but in this one, where it's about hiring and it's about retaining employees, they're very much looking for technology, benefits, all the things we offer. And even if you're a mid-sized and might have to go through some reshuffling of people, you're looking to one of those 700 HR specialists that John mentioned that we have that would say, ""Okay, how do I do this? How do I attract people? How do I retain them? How do I maybe lay some off while I hire others in the little bit larger companies?"" So we're actually seeing a great demand for technology in the HCM world as well as being able to handle remote workforces, which really are here to stay. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Eugene M. Simuni, MoffettNathanson LLC - Analyst [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Okay. Okay. And then for my follow-up, probably a question for Efrain, actually switching gears a bit. We talked about the margin dynamics over the short term already a bit, so I understand there's kind of ups and downs for the quarter. But I wanted to touch on the longer-term margin dynamics for a second. As we are now moving away from the COVID pandemic and settling more in maybe the steady state where digital channels have become a bigger part, digital buying has become a bigger part post-pandemic of your model, how are you seeing that really impacting structural margins of the business as we kind of get more experience with that maybe more digitally-focused model, I'm curious. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, Eugene, I think we've talked about -- certainly have talked with many of you on the call. We have a relentless drive for efficiency in the business. And so as more of the business goes into either digitally enabled solutions or fully automated solutions, we expect over time that's going to be a driver of improved productivity and improved operating margins. So I've said -- I always caveat with you also have to balance investment in the business for sustainable growth. So if we get 50 basis points or 75 or 100 of improvement in operating margins, we may decide, hey, that in order to create more operating efficiency -- I'm sorry, more sustainable margins over the long haul, we have to invest a part of it. But certainly, there are very few weeks that don't pass where we're not having that conversation. And I think that John has been a big driver in the last decade around making that model work, and I expect that to continue over the cycle. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, I would -- I'll jump on that because I think, look, our business model and our DNA as a company is around being the best operators in the business. I think we've proven that over decades, and that's certainly not going to change with me in this position. And I think what you're seeing, is it goes back to the question you asked earlier, is, look, clients are demanding technology because their employees are demanding technology. I mean, what we're seeing relative to the digitalization is really not just us trying to push that on clients. There's a big pull from clients and their employees to expect that they're going to have a technology experience, whether that's when they're recruiting. If they want to recruit people, you're not putting an ad in the paper. So if you're doing that, you're probably not going to find many people, particularly the people that are out looking for employment. And so whether it's benefits, whether it's their finances, they're looking for that to drive that. And not only is that a benefit for the customer, but that's also a benefit for Paychex. So digitization continues with our mobile usage. It continues to accelerate with our clients and our employees. It's up 67% year-over-year, and we had a pretty big year the year prior to that. So I continue to see this as kind of being something -- it's not a nice-to-have anymore. It's really a must-have if you want to go out and compete in the talent market today. You've got to have an HR technology solution that is easy to use and really meets the full needs of what employees are looking for. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bryan Connell Keane, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Wanted to ask about kind of the different market segments. I know you guys called out strength in the mid-market. So just thinking about the health in the lower end of the market. Could you just talk a little bit about new business starts, retention in that market? Any kind of softness in spend you're seeing there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think as we mentioned at the beginning, Bryan, the small business, new business starts are not as strong as they were last year, right? The last couple of years during COVID and the pandemic, of course, we had a lot of people leave big business and start businesses. And so small business retention, from a client perspective, we said, was starting to normalize a bit because some small businesses that started during that period have gone out of business. But the demand for employees through -- from small businesses is still needed. And we're still -- they're still adding employees. So the good -- I guess the bad news is some are a little bit more out of business. But the good news is that most of our clients, even at the small end, are adding employees and still have a lot of postings and openings to fill. So I think that mid-market, I think we're -- what we've said about mid-market being stronger is I think we've executed much, much better in the mid-market, not only from a product suite and a technology suite of what we're offering to the client, but the sales team has done really well. We hit our stride kind of last year, and that has continued right through the first quarter, with very good double-digit growth there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. And I would add that not only is the demand is still strong in the mid-market, double-digit first quarter, I think, well positioned going forward. Retention, when you really look at that mid-market, which, you get into our HR services, you get into the PEO, you get into the mid-market HCM, where our clients are getting the full value utilizing the technology, we're seeing very good retention levels. As we said, our revenue retention is at record levels. I mentioned -- I called out the PEO, particularly just on stellar performance in the first quarter relative to client retention, and we've seen strong retention in our HR businesses holistically, and the mid-market is solid as well. I also think that our price value equation in that market has held up very, very well as well with our average sell-in revenue in the first quarter really strong. Really strong. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bryan Connell Keane, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst [39] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. That's helpful. And just one clarification for Efrain. On the second quarter margin, I heard about the second quarter revenue being lower, and you called out some call-outs there. But on the margin in particular, is it just a revenue issue plus additional investments that just flow in that caused the drop in the margin? I just want to make sure I have all the pieces there for the 38% margin. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [40] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bryan, you heard exactly what I said. So I must have been partially clear on that. So no, that's exactly it. A little lower revenue, a little higher expenses. It's typically the lowest revenue quarter of the year, so you get a little bit of that impact. And it's in line with what we anticipated it to be. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [41] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Bryan -- or I'm sorry, Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Damien McVeigh, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD [42] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And my congratulations. And we share your view on Efrain, too, Marty. Maybe just one, I guess, higher level. I mean, John, your taking the baton at the organization is super, super strong. But no 2 CEOs are the same. So any initial thoughts as to areas of focus, maybe where you might dial in a little bit more? I mean, obviously, you're building on a great legacy. But just any thoughts as to where your initial areas of focus are, whether it's capital allocation or just technology or just any initial thoughts? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [43] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Well, Kevin, thanks for that. And as you know, I've been a part of the leadership team for nearly a decade now. So a lot of the things we've been working on, I've been involved in and highly supportive of. So look, I think you can expect we're going to continue to really focus on expanding our leadership in technology and HR. I mentioned it earlier, going to continue to be the best operators in the business. And we're going to consistently be a top performer in terms of total shareholder return. I mean, I think those are 3 traditions I don't plan to mess with, quite frankly, because they're working and are what I believe. Look, I think we've got -- look, we've got opportunities to expand our offerings and continue to innovate and change. I would tell you that I think Paychex has always done that. And there's no question, under Marty's leadership, that has accelerated. And I think you should expect us to continue to accelerate that. We're going to continue to look for new ways and growth platforms that we can apply to help our clients grow. We're going to continue to invest in improving the experiences. I've mentioned that. I keep using this word, experiences. We have a lot of great products. We have a lot of great service offerings. How we package those things together to address business problems is critical. I think the other thing that we've began to do more of, and I think you'll see more of, is, look, we're really beginning to use a large amount of internal data we have to really apply that, the Retention Insights product that we've launched for our customers and being used with our HR professionals, with the customers to identify how they can retain clients. We're also using ERTC as a good example where we're using our internal data sets to really identify customers that have specific needs and then able to get our sales force into a situation where they can talk to a client who has that need at that moment. And that drives productivity. I think you're going to continue to see us do that. And I think we're going to continue to see what I said before. We're a tech company, and we're going to continue to invest like a tech company. So I think relative to capital utilization, you're going to continue to see us look at applying capital in areas where we can improve our technology footprint and help our clients. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kevin Damien McVeigh, Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD [44] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, I think, for you, Efrain. I appreciate what you're saying in terms of the outlook on the Fed funds, things like that. But can you tell us like what Fed fund rate is in the implied guidance right now? And then just remind us, if you can, kind of what 25 basis points -- like what the sensitivity is to the revenue for every incremental 25 bps? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [45] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So in the first quarter, we called it out. It was between 3% and 4%, kind of around the midpoint there where we expected. I think I may have called specifically 3.25%. So right now, we're working with something in that range. Obviously, everyone's chief economist has a different number that ranges probably with the 4%, and some probably are 5% and above. But I want to call out that -- and so by the way, 0.25 basis point is somewhere in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of net income. So it's potentially important. It could be important. But Kevin, the one thing I think that Jason pointed out that's really important that I think what makes it a little bit trickier is you don't want to push your chips to the middle of the table and go all in short term and have a great year in terms of year-over-year interest income only to give it back in the next year. So what we're really looking at is what's the right duration for the portfolio in this environment? And so that's why I can't -- I wouldn't necessarily -- and I'm cautious about saying, ""Hey, I got 100 basis points up versus my forecast, and that relates to X."" I'm a little bit cautious about that because I think we've got to manage a somewhat volatile interest rate environment here with the Fed and figure out what the implications for '24 are. So I'll just leave it at that. So we're looking at it. And by the way, I mean, it's not like somehow we're geniuses here. We got some of the best minds in the business on the fixed income side working for us. So we'll take counsel and have a lot of discussion on that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [46] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [47] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is (inaudible) on for Samad. Marty and Efrain, congrats on the strong results. John, also congrats on the new role. So I think we've touched on a lot already, but I wanted to double-click on the employee growth that you've spoken about in both Management Solutions and PEO. So obviously, with COVID, right, the recovery was not completely even by vertical or geographic area. I think in the past, we called out Florida was -- saw some strength first. So I'm curious. The growth that you saw this past quarter, is that broad-based? Or is it coming from a specific vertical or geographic area maybe lapping what we saw at the start of the recovery from the pandemic? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [48] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So let me disaggregate. I'll give some, and then let John add some color commentary. So the PEO is a little bit different than Management Solutions per se. So what we saw was strength in ads in larger clients, and that's partly a result of really good work that we have done over the last 4 to 6 quarters in mid-market. We've done good work before that, but I think you've seen the benefits of that coupled with, and that's always important, coupled with the improvement from last quarter in terms of the overall hiring environment in the first quarter. We expect that, that starts to slow a bit. With respect to PEO, when we look at worksite employees, that was pretty widespread. So obviously, because our business is over-indexed in Florida and in certain verticals relative to Management Solutions, we saw strength there, but PEO is pretty widespread. Now PEO is a little bit different in the sense that our average client is roughly about 30 or so employees. So you're also getting a little bit of a larger, let's call it, client effect in terms of the adds. So that's a little bit more color, Marty. Marty, John, you want to comment? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [49] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I just -- I think we've seen it kind of across the board. Most of the client base has seen an increase in employees. So we've seen them adding employees. And of course, that's going to be in that 1 to 20 range, in particular, but 1 to 50, probably we're seeing that. I think that Florida, the south, we've seen that in the Small Business Index in that those have been the strongest job growth states for small business because that's where the people are. And so there's still a lot of job openings, particularly in leisure and hospitality. And they're able to fill them in the Texas, Florida, Georgia, even North Carolina kind of areas. They're their best job growth kind of area. So that's where small businesses are doing the best. But overall, we've seen our business is able to add people. And obviously, then, that's adding checks, as John mentioned. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [50] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No, just to reiterate, I think we've seen across the board in pretty much all segments improvement in the employment levels. And still in all the surveys we're seeing, again, both the survey we did, I know there was one that I think that was just in a paper recently a couple of days ago that I read that reinforced it. Small business owners are struggling more than mid-sized companies, and we've seen that in our data. When we look at where the number of checks and where the worksite employees have accelerated more, a mid-market company that offers more benefits is out competing for the talent. And so that's why we've really been focused on sort of this recruiting and the partnerships that we've built and the technology we've built to help small business owners have a fair advantage. I would also say to Efrain's point, another interesting and again, a little dated, but we certainly looked at this a lot when we were doing the down trim. What we know is customers who were in our HR products, whether that's our ASO product or our PEO product, they decelerated less than the general market. And when it came time for recovery, they were able to staff up faster. And I do think that's because of our HR support. So we, certainly in those areas, have seen better recovery, faster recovery, more full employment. And I think that has to do with both our technology and our advisory service and helping them (inaudible) advantage there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [51] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Awesome. That's all very helpful color. I think along the same lines I wanted to follow up with, we've talked about how difficult hiring is at this time. And your own business or you've seen this hiring pull forward, and that's obviously impacting the cadence of margins throughout the year. So this past quarter, were your hiring plans on track, ahead of or lagging your initial expectations? And was there any change in your ability to hire incremental sales or support staff throughout the quarter? Just curious if there were any changes on that end. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [52] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- No. I mean, actually, we did very well. The hiring machine really took off here from a recruiting and a hiring perspective, and retention is better. So I think you're hearing that in the overall market, particularly for larger businesses. Now we made some changes to that. We improved some of our starting wage rates just like a lot of companies and did some other things as well for some of the existing employees. And I think that's paid off. Yes, we're fully staffed, and we're ready to go. Actually, we're ready at the start of the quarter for sales and everything else. So we've done very well on the hiring front and are ready for the rest of the year, too. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [53] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. Again, John, congrats on the new role. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [54] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- James Eugene Faucette, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD [55] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My congratulations to both Marty and John as well. I wanted to -- you've addressed a lot of our key questions, but I wanted to quickly follow up. Marty, can you just talk to really quickly again the expected cadence for PEO during the course of the year? And just so I understand the expected improvement later, is that because of the things John mentioned, of adjustments to the PEO plans, some changes in sales, et cetera? Or is there something else that you expect to have an impact there? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [56] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey, James, let me talk to that. So I think as I said at the beginning of the call, we started the year in the first half a little bit under what we expected from an attachment perspective, and insurances were a little softer than we anticipated. The impact on margin's pretty insignificant. As we get through the year, we -- our expectations are that the PEO growth accelerates in the back half of the year, and part of it is that we had pretty strong worksite employee growth coming out of the first quarter. So we -- if you get that coupled with better health care attachment in the back half of the year, look, if people make decisions or making decisions in this quarter, you don't see the revenue this quarter. You see it in future quarters. They're making those decisions on the assumption that those things materialize, which they should, then growth accelerates in the back half of the year. That's basically the explanation for what's going on. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- James Eugene Faucette, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD [57] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess more from a landscape perspective. You've touched on and obviously highlighted over time but also on this call everything that you've done from a technology perspective in terms of Paychex's ability to help its customers and continue to improve. But what are you seeing happening in the regional provider space? How are they being able to keep up with you, the incumbents or on tech? And do you expect further consolidation? Or I guess the real question is, where you're not winning from regionals, what is -- what's the primary reason? And how can you address that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [58] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, sure. Actually, we're doing very well against the regionals. I don't -- I think it is hard to keep up. They certainly have been viable competitors, but I think that it's -- we haven't seen a big change in the competitive environment. I think if anything, we feel like we've really continued to jump start. John mentioned the Voice Assist that we just offered. No one else has offered that through -- with Google. The work we've done to combine for recruiting and onboarding their clients, I think the -- there may be some consolidation. I think they're looking for probably some more support from a tech standpoint because there will continue to be a lot of investment going forward that we obviously have a great track record of doing. But I think there's been a lot of demand, so that's kind of kept everybody happy. The pie is -- the overall pie has continued to grow, particularly in the mid-market. So I think they've all done -- everybody has done pretty well. We'll have to see how that goes forward as we get to the kind of the back half of this year. But we feel very confident, not any big changes in the competitive environment, and we've performed very well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [59] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [60] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quick thanks to Marty, of course. Always appreciate our conversation through the years. So I'm not sure if you'll miss these calls, but definitely we'll miss chatting with you. And John, look forward to working with you more. You did, in your remarks, credit Marty's vision for embracing technology. And I think someone asked you about what your focus or legacy might be. I caught that, but I'm just curious, John, given your background on services and where you were before Paychex, I'm curious if you see more opportunity to improve services here further for Paychex to complement tech? Or is it one and the same in terms of tech and services starting to blend a little bit further? I'm just curious how you think about balancing those 2 things, right, between the services and the tech of the company. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [61] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, look, Tien-Tsin, I think you're right. I see it one and the same, and that's probably the reason why Marty and I were reminiscing about my interview here. And what really attracted me was Marty's vision was very consistent with mine and my experience about where I saw our industry going from my prior experience. And my view is I think having the best technology and having a unified user experience is going to be critical not only for the demand of what customers and employees want but also to drive the operational efficiency that I think customers are going to want. That being said, customers need to know how to use that tool. And they are facing complex issues outside of items that technology can solve, particularly in the HR area. So I think we have a unique position to be able to reposition our traditional services kind of, ""Hey, I put something in a system for you,"" and really position that more as an advisory opportunity. And I think about the things we're doing with the mass sets of data that we have, the benchmarking data, the way we can do analytics, the fact that we can call client up and say, ""We think you're going to have a retention problem. Let us walk you through your insights."" That's what service is going to be. It's really not even service in the historical sense that you would see a service company talk about. And I do believe that, that's going to resonate, and we see it resonating in this complex environment. More and more companies are going to end up having employees in multiple states than ever before to compete for talent and the remote workforce. That brings regulatory complexities that not just technology can solve for you. You've got to think about how you're going to do this. And so I do think that we're uniquely positioned, and I think you'll continue to see us invest in technology and invest in HR and really position ourselves as the digital HR leader in the marketplace. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [62] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. I appreciate you going through that because I still think about it. When I started covering Paychex, I always thought of it as a services company, and of course, tech and digital has taken over everything. So just wanted to get back to basics there. If you don't mind my quick follow-up. I know the call is getting long here. Just thinking about the modules and the breadth of services. You mentioned Paychex being the largest 401(k) recordkeeper. I know the equity markets have come down a little bit. Is that having any influence on your outlook in general? And also just clarifying, if you don't mind, 2 questions in one. Just the health care enrollment piece. Is the lower attach or enrollment a function of mix of clients? Or is it a competitiveness of the plans issue? I just want to make sure I understand that, if you don't mind those 2 questions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [63] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll talk to the first, and I'll let John talk a little bit, Marty, if you want, on the second. So in our retirement services business, as many of you know, we do have about 1/3 of the revenue there is derived from basis points. So it has a modest drag in terms of revenue. It's not really significant. I just put it as de minimis in terms of the balance of the year. And then on health care enrollment, you're asking for more color on that. I'll give -- I'll let John touch on what's driving a little bit lower health care enrollment. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [64] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Look, I think -- I wish I had the perfect answer to that. Looking at all the data, my experience tells me a lot of that can be mix of clients. Again, a lot of it has to do what's the average wage of a client, what's the industry they're in. Like you also have, as I said, economic situations where a person may be having benefits and deciding I can't afford benefits right now, given my economic situation, they dropped the benefits. We recognize that. That's why we're doing a lot in really looking at our plan designs and the PEO in particular, rolling out lower cost plans, also rolling out nontraditional plans. We've actually created an entire wellness kind of spectrum of products and services to really meet the needs of the economic needs of every type of worksite employee that we would have there. And we're also driving digitalization into our H&amp;B business. I mentioned that earlier. That's rolling out in the second quarter so that we can offer a more full suite of benefit options that can match the price point of both the clients and their employees regardless of what their economic situation is. So we certainly are trying to expand what we're doing. We recognize that for some employees and some customers, the cost of getting some of these benefits is outside of their capabilities right now. And so we're really focused on a product development perspective to make sure we have the broadest suite of offerings in the marketplace. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [65] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Steven Marcon, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [66] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Marty, congratulations on just tremendous accomplishments over the tenure that you've been the CEO. And John, look forward to working with you. With regards to the macro environment, you did mention small business formations are a little bit lower. How are you thinking about the sales pipeline for HR Management Solutions? And to what extent can you dial the marketing strategy to highlight some of the tech improvements? I was at HR Tech. I was really impressed by the voice recognition program with Google. And are you charging more for those types of solutions? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [67] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. We're really -- I mean, one, let's take the marketing side of it. It's doing exactly that, Mark. It's being at HR Tech. It's being -- it's getting the word out there. We're doing a lot with -- in trying to partner with folks like Google to be sure that it's known that we have the only -- we're the only one that can do that with their Google Assistant and have you be able to do it totally hands-free. We're pushing -- the marketing has been pretty aggressive for years on -- through webinars, through the tech conferences and, of course, through all the podcasts and then just all of the online work that we've done. And that's been very important to us to get the message out, and we think that, that's worked well. So I think that's been good. I think on the -- so we think there's still a huge demand. And John mentioned, I think, earlier, the product penetration rates continue to go up. I think that as the tech word has gotten out there and the need, of course, as we've talked about a lot on the call, we've really seen this additional product penetration. And even if new business starts are less than what they were, they're still up. They're just not -- they're not up the big numbers that they were during COVID when everybody -- or many people ran from large businesses and started small businesses. So they're still up. We're still obviously doing very well on the start-ups, but I think we're doing even better with the product suite to make the additional penetration of the existing client base. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Steven Marcon, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [68] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Right. So the way I'm taking it, it sounds like the pipeline in terms of the key selling season for Management Solutions as well as PEO continues to be robust. And you're not really seeing much of a change in terms of what we're reading about from a macro headline perspective as it relates to that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [69] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Correct. Correct. We still feel it should be a good selling season. It's early, but we should feel -- we feel good about it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Steven Marcon, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [70] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great. And then can you talk a little bit about retention? How do you think that ends up being impacted as ERTC kind of winds down? Does that have any sort of impact? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [71] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark, so as -- we gave a little bit of color on that in Marty's call. I think what I've called out is 2 things. One is, and it's one thing that John mentioned, but from a revenue retention standpoint, we're at near-record highs. So that makes sense. Marty called out, on the very lower end, we've seen a little bit more churn. That is to be expected, given where the market is right now. So on those 2, I think we feel we're pretty well positioned going into the balance of the year. ERTC really should not have a significant impact on client retention. I think that it is a -- if anything, it's positive in the sense that it just demonstrates the value add of Paychex. A lot of our competitors are not talking about it, because candidly, their model doesn't allow them to get there. Some are doing it. But I think we think about giving our clients that level of consulting and expertise that John was mentioning earlier. So from a retention standpoint, really should not have a significant impact. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [72] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next question comes from (inaudible) from Northcoast Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [73] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congrats on a great quarter. I just want to get some color around your float portfolio. And as the Fed continues to hike rates, do you think there will be any changes? Or has there been any changes in the management of your float portfolio? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [74] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think I answered earlier that in the environment, every time the Fed makes another pronouncement about what they expect to do, we huddle and figure out what the implications of the portfolio are. And what we're trying to do is adjust the duration based on what we believe is going to happen and when we think we're going to see peak interest rates to position the portfolio not just for '23, but for '24. So we -- I would say, the changes would become a little bit more dynamic in terms of what the balance between short and long term is. And as the year progresses, we'll continue to make adjustments real time to take advantage of what we think is our changes in the landscape. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unidentified Analyst, [75] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Right. And do you have any thoughts on change in your return of capital to shareholder strategy? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Efrain Rivera, Paychex, Inc. - Senior VP &amp; CFO [76] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- They're really -- the short answer is no. We -- and I think Marty and John talked a little bit about this, which is obviously, we're going to continue to pay a pretty strong dividend. We will buy back shares to offset dilution. And we will look at deployment of capital in terms of M&amp;A if it makes sense, if it builds value in the portfolio. So from that standpoint, no significant changes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [77] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Your last question comes from Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Darren Wurtzel, Wolfe Research, LLC - Research Analyst [78] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just one question from me. Just on the revenue retention side of things. I know you called out it's still trending above pre-pandemic levels. And I think John had mentioned you're continuing to see attach rates of high-value products. So just wondering if you can just maybe give a little bit more color on what products are exactly resonating most with the client base? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- John B. Gibson, Paychex, Inc. - President &amp; COO [79] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. It's really our HR suite of products. You continue to see our online products. I just mentioned the retention -- the recruiting and applicant tracking really, really popular right now. 401(k) retirement, very popular, right? And then time and attendance is the other. I put that in kind of the online area. Anything around the automation of the employee-employer relationship is very high demand, very high demand right now. People are looking for those operational efficiencies, their workforces are more dispersed than ever before, and they're leveraging technology to keep track of what's going on. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [80] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gretchen, that's it, right, for calls? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [81] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. No further questions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Martin Mucci, Paychex, Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO [82] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- All right. Well, one more thank you to the over 16,000 employees at Paychex who deliver the great results for us all. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. I would like to thank you all for your support you've given me in my role as CEO over the years, and I know I'm leaving you all in good hands. Have a great day. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [83] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.]"

Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting the industry. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.Nonetheless, continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Limoneira Co LMNR.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial product). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology. The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.What's Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryGrowing Organic Demand: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement prompted by consumers’ increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry’s growth. Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $193.5 billion suggest a decline of $2.5 billion from the fiscal 2022 forecast of a record $196 billion. Declines in cotton, beef and sorghum exports are the key factors resulting in lower export projections. Cotton exports are expected to decline due to drought-slashed exportable volumes. Beef exports are expected to be impacted by tight U.S. supplies. Sorghum exports are likely to decline on sharply lower exportable supplies. Wheat exports are expected to be affected by lower unit values. Meanwhile, higher exports of soybeans and horticultural products are likely to aid. Soybean exports are forecast to be up $2.2 billion to a record $35.2 billion on higher prices. Horticulture exports of $39.5 billion are expected to increase $400 million on higher exports of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, offset by declines in tree nut exports.Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. Also, the conflict in Ukraine has been creating headwinds. The companies have resorted to solid pricing strategies to counter the rising raw material costs. The participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it at the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in a year.The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 19.2% in a year against declines of 17.2% for the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and 8.5% for the sector.One-Year Price PerformanceAgriculture - Operations Industry's ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 15.74X and the sector’s 17.75X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.73X, as low as 10.24X and at the median of 14.32X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Agriculture Operations Stocks to Keep an Eye onNone of the stocks in the Zacks Agriculture – Operations universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Here, we suggest four stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) from the same industry, which investors may hold on to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Archer Daniels: The Chicago, IL-based agricultural product company’s leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials has been a key contributor to its momentum. Its focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a significant growth driver. Solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations have been driving growth. Its Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit have been aiding the results. The company has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Management is optimistic about the company’s 2022 results and envisions another year of strong earnings growth.

This has been taking a toll on the U.S. equity market, which is plummeting as depicted by the 19.82%, 30.78% and 23.48% year-to-date declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 indexes, respectively.The Federal Reserve recently passed another 0.75% hike in its benchmark interest rates. The Fed has further vowed to hike interest rates to drag down inflation to its target of 2% at best by 2025.Fed’s aggressive stance on inflation control is responsible for the huge sell-off in the broader equity market. Soaring interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which, in turn, will consistently affect consumer spending.From an investment perspective, investors should not completely shun equities. We advise investors looking for good investment opportunities to park their money in tech high fliers.The widely-diversified tech sector holds the potential to defy recessionary woes and minimize the anticipated contraction of the world economy despite rising interest rates, supply-chain constraints and geopolitical tensions.The technology sector holds plenty of growth opportunities with the ongoing worldwide digitization. Growing 5G deployments, the rising proliferation of cloud services, cybersecurity solutions, IoT, AI, Machine Learning, Blockchain, autonomous driving technology, and the increasing trend of hybrid work are likely to be the major tailwinds for tech companies.We recommend four blue-chip stocks from the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, namely Fortinet FTNT, Zscaler ZS, Synopsys SNPS and STMicroelectronics STM.Why Should You Invest in These Stocks?With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected the above-mentioned four blue-chip stocks (market cap greater than $20 billion) that are well-poised to grow through the rest of 2022, as these are highly reputed, fundamentally strong and financially resilient.Apart from having solid fundamentals, the aforementioned stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.Fortinet has been benefiting from the rising demand for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. It has also been gaining from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.Increasing IT spending on cybersecurity is expected to aid Fortinet in growing faster than the security market. Its focus on enhancing the UTM portfolio through product development and acquisitions remains another tailwind. Strong deal wins remain the company’s key growth drivers.FTNT currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. It has a market capitalization of $38.08 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fortinet’s 2022 earnings has improved 2.9% to $1.05 per share over the past 60 days. The long-term earnings growth rate for the stock is pegged at 18%.

(NYSE:PM) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$135b last week after a 9.4% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 7.4% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Philip Morris International's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Philip Morris International. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Philip Morris International?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Philip Morris International does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Philip Morris International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.5% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 17 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Philip Morris International Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$224m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Philip Morris International. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

""The firms did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications, in violation of the federal securities laws.""The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) penalty totaled $1.1 billion across 15 broker-dealers: Barclays Capital (BCS), Bank of America, Citigroup (C), Credit Suisse (CS), Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS Securities, Jefferies, Nomura Securities, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged 11 institutions a collective $710 million fine.“Finance, ultimately, depends on trust,” Gensler added. “By failing to honor their recordkeeping and books-and-records obligations, the market participants we have charged today have failed to maintain that trust.""A man checks his phone outside the Royal Exchange in London.

105,2ed0ad08-bcd9-3e80-a0da-dcb4c4efbe46,APTV,2022-09-29,Is Aptiv PLC's (NYSE:APTV) Recent Price Movement Underpinned By Its Weak Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aptiv-plcs-nyse-aptv-recent-135002362.html,1664373002,STORY,['APTV'],"[Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) has had a rough month with its share price down 12%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, and therefore we decided to pay more attention to the company's financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Aptiv's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Aptiv How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aptiv is:1.9% = US$161m ÷ US$8.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.02 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Aptiv's Earnings Growth And 1.9% ROEIt is hard to argue that Aptiv's ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 14%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 5.6% seen by Aptiv was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Aptiv's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 12% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is APTV fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Aptiv Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Aptiv's performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

I think this password sharing crackdown is going to be very bumpy in terms of how they police it, multiple family members using it in different locations.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's true. And clearly, Netflix is really sort of trying to look for some other options, as we saw those subscriber numbers started falling, more competition in this space. We're even seeing them increase their push into gaming. We're seeing that they're launching an internal gaming studio. In Finland right now, they have 1/3-- about 31 games on the app. Netflix isn't something you usually associate with gaming, so they're definitely trying to broaden their horizons in a very difficult time for streamers right now.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. It could make a lot of sense when you take a look at this bullish call here from the Street. Cowen was out a couple of months ago, saying that their new ad tier plan could potentially be a game changer here in order to attract those subscribers that maybe do plan to cut the cord because of higher prices. So if you're able to bring in new subscribers, maybe those who share an account and might be forced off here in a couple of months, it could be a strong play here for the company. Obviously, Netflix has been under pressure, so a valuation call as well.]"

117,7c6e3929-6df3-3d7d-a4d7-df09addc75b5,PEG,2022-09-29,Is Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) Trading At A 24% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/public-enterprise-group-incorporated-nyse-191416363.html,1664392456,STORY,['PEG'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$555.7mUS$488.0mUS$240.5mUS$527.5mUS$775.4mUS$1.03bUS$1.28bUS$1.51bUS$1.70bUS$1.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 47%Est @ 33.48%Est @ 24.02%Est @ 17.39%Est @ 12.76%Est @ 9.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.3% -US$528US$440US$206US$429US$598US$758US$892US$994US$1.1kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.0bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.3%– 1.9%) = US$56bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$56b÷ ( 1 + 5.3%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$39b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$59.6, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Public Service Enterprise Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Then our free report on General Dynamics will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is General Dynamics' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as General Dynamics' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 3.4%. The solid recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 5.9% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.6% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that General Dynamics is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From General Dynamics' P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of General Dynamics' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Having said that, be aware  General Dynamics is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than General Dynamics.

Natural gas prices reached a record high of 321 euros ($309) per megawatt-hour (mWh) in August, compared with 27 euros a year ago. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin has lost about 60% of its value this year and is hovering around $20,000.Energy in the northernmost parts of Norway and Sweden is as much as 10 times cheaper than in the southern parts of those countries. That’s because the countries are split into different energy markets. The Nordics have a higher proportion of electricity coming from renewable energy compared with the rest of Europe – almost 100%. But the southern parts of the countries are connected to European markets, which means higher demand and thus higher prices.In Europe, the further north, the higher the use of carbon-free energy. (Electricity Maps/Edited by CoinDesk)Back in March, when CoinDesk visited Kryptovault in southern Norway, CEO Kjetil Pettersen said that his company, which runs data centers that host large-scale bitcoin miners, was looking to expand in the north as energy prices were starting to rise. That was before Russia invaded Ukraine, sending natural gas prices soaring. The company closed its operations in the south in May and June and has been slowly moving its machines to a site in the Lofoten region, just north of the Arctic Circle, Pettersen told CoinDesk.Similarly, a smaller bitcoin mining site in southern Spain that CoinDesk also visited earlier this year is being moved to Paraguay, said the owner Jon Arregi.The companies' situation is emblematic of how the bitcoin mining industry in Europe has been responding to energy prices that have shot up this year, largely because of the war in Ukraine. Miners are either shutting down or moving to places where energy is cheaper, especially in the far northern reaches of Norway and Sweden where there is abundant cheap hydropower, or in the Americas, even as they fear tougher regulations may be coming in states like New York.Story continuesDaniel Jogg, CEO of Hungarian miner and equipment supplier Enerhash, said that many companies in Germany have also stopped their operations there and are looking to move to the U.S. or Sweden.Fiorenzo Manganiello, founder of Switzerland-based Cowa Energy, a mining company that also provides venture funding, said that in southern Norway “it’s impossible” to mine given the high energy prices. The current macroeconomic situation has been a “disaster” for the mining industry in Europe, he said.But while the Nordics’ fragmented energy markets can bring opportunities, they also present difficulties in hedging power prices, Jogg said. The financial products sold to companies looking to hedge their power costs are aimed at the entire Nordics market, but the actual price of power miners are looking to hedge is likely for a narrower region, where they mine, he explained.Power costs a pretty penny in much of Europe. In the second quarter, the average wholesale price of energy in France and Germany was more than double what it is in the U.S., according to the International Energy Agency. In mid-September, following measures to curb the price hikes, the wholesale price of power in many European countries was still more than 350 euros ($350) per megawatt-hour, several times more than what miners are looking for to break even.Bad timingThe timing has been bad for miners, and several factors have contributed to an ever-worsening energy crisis. The war in Ukraine increased the price of natural gas after European political leaders sanctioned Russia, one of the continent’s biggest suppliers of fossil fuels.Also, over the last few years European countries have decommissioned nuclear plants and closed coal factories, which also limited the supply of power. France, which has the largest share of its electricity generated by nuclear power in the world, shut down 32 of 56 reactors for maintenance this year.The energy crisis has caused Germany to backtrack on some measures in a surprising move; the country’s parliaments voted to bring coal plants back to life over the summer.Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine rages on, European Union leaders have placed more sanctions on Russian gas companies, which prompted Russia to close the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in early September. That pipeline, which transports liquified natural gas from Russia to Germany, was allegedly “sabotaged” along with Nord Stream 2, on Sept. 28.However, moving to the northern parts of Scandinavia isn’t risk-free for miners. There were a few days in September when the price of energy in northern Sweden increased to around 20 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), compared with an average of around 3.5 euro cents per kWh the rest of the year, because of low wind production, Jogg said.The future of the energy market looks uncertain, with demand expected to increase in the next few months as households try to cope with winter temperatures while European leaders remain unwilling to back down on sanctions.At the same time, Europe has managed to fill its storage piles with natural gas that could help the bloc make through the winter. The initial shock from the Nord Stream pipeline closure to the energy market appears to be subsiding, with prices coming back down in the past few days.New developments in nuclear power may also relieve some pressures. Rusinovich noted that a nuclear power plant set to go into full operation in Finland later in the year, the country’s fifth, and reactors in France coming back online in early 2023 after maintenance, could free up some of the market pressure on Norway and Sweden.Policy implicationsEurope’s politicians have started calling on their people in their countries to reduce their energy consumption – or else. French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, said that plans to ration energy are being prepared ""in case"" they are necessary.In a speech earlier in September, European Commission President Ursula von der Layen said the commission is looking to overhaul the energy sector by imposing a cap on energy companies’ profits and perhaps a cap on the price of natural gas. The Commission is the European Union’s executive body.Yet, Manganiello of Cowa Energy doesn’t see EU-level policy on mining coming any time soon because that process typically takes a long time, and it is usually local municipalities that approve mining projects.But in the current crises in energy, geopolitics and possibly domestic affairs, “there is a lot of, let's say, witch hunting” and mining in the past has always been “an easy target,” Rusinovich said.In the meantime, the icy pastures of northern Norway and Sweden beckon.]"

In the same months last year, imports were 64 and 63 million litres respectively, well above national demand.Nigeria's reliance on imported oil products looks set to continue, two industry sources with knowledge of the matter said, with a new refinery near Lagos unlikely to come online until the end of 2023 and a revamp of the 210,000 barrel-per-day Port Harcourt facility expected to take several years.NNPC and Nigeria's finance ministry did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment.'CURIOUS CASE'Although the Nigerian government announced plans to remove the gasoline subsidy last year, it then backtracked in July, citing concerns over potential social unrest.The World Bank estimates inflationary pressures will tip 7 million more Nigerians into poverty this year, bringing the total to 45% of the population of 200 million.""Despite the better-than-expected performance of the services and agriculture sectors and higher oil prices ... Nigeria is experiencing a curious case of lower fiscal revenues,"" Marco Hernandez, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria, said in a June development Report.""This is limiting the government's ability to expand basic services, support the economic recovery, and protect the poor during this difficult time,"" Hernandez added in the report.Nigeria's Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed has repeatedly warned about the high cost of gasoline subsidies, saying the bill could reach $16.2 billion in 2023.And the World Bank estimated that foregone oil revenues would total 5 trillion naira ($12.04 billion) this year due to the subsidy, equivalent to 30% of Nigeria's entire budget.In 2020, NNPC retained 4% of oil and gas sales to cover gasoline subsidies. This rose to 45% last year and in 2022 it has reached 83% of sales.The increasing fuel subsidy is taking away money from capital expenditure and is a ""major drainer to overall government revenues and fiscal position,"" Nigeria's finance ministry said in its latest budget projection in August.""The subsidy on Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) supply has had significant adverse impact on government revenues,"" it added.Nwanze of SBM Intelligence said: ""The subsidy is a complete waste at this point, but it's politically explosive.""Nigeria holds presidential elections in February against a backdrop of price rises as a result of the Ukraine crisis and post-pandemic supply chain bottlenecks.As well as the higher cost of gasoline purchases, a more costly swap contract has also come at a bad time.Until the end of last year, NNPC covered domestic gasoline needs via Direct Sale Direct Purchase (DSDP) contracts.Now NNPC is also buying ad hoc cargoes and through a Crude Oil Refining and Direct Partnership Agreement (CORDPA), which involves paying higher premiums and a trader waiting longer to receive its crude delivery as payment.In May, for example, the DSDP premium was around $10 per tonne of gasoline, while the premium paid under a CORDPA was $22, according to NNPC's spreadsheets. Rates vary seasonally and for most of the year these levels had been $35 to about $50 a tonne. NNPC paid up $80 and $100 for some ad hoc cargoes.And although gasoline is subsidised, the amount ordinary Nigerians pay at the pump remains higher than the set price.In its FAAC reports for 2021 and 2022, NNPC set its subsidised price at 124 naira ($0.30) per litre, but the average pump price is closer to 200 naira per litre across many states.""We should be reaping a bumper harvest but alas we are not,"" lamented one Nigerian official.(Additional reporting by Camillus Eboh in Abuja, Libby George in Lagos, Hamza Ibrahim in Kano, Tife Owolabi in Yenagoa and Anamesere Igboeroteonwu in Onitsha; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Alexander Smith)]"

We're pleased to work with Portland General Electric and help them achieve their decarbonization goals,"" said Rebecca Kujawa, president and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources, the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun, and a world leader in battery storage. ""These facilities generate low-cost, homegrown energy and will provide millions of dollars in additional tax revenue to Morrow County over the life of the project.""Wheatridge plays a key role in helping PGE meet Oregon's targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power served to retail customers by at least 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035 and 100% by 2040.

(NYSE:NEE) in the last 12 months may probably not pay attention to the stock's recent 5.4% drop. After taking the recent loss into consideration, the US$6.5m worth of stock they bought is now worth US$7.0m, indicating that their investment yielded a positive return.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NextEra EnergyIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider James Robo bought US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$81.08. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While NextEra Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. NextEra Energy insiders own about US$269m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About NextEra Energy Insiders?The fact that there have been no NextEra Energy insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like NextEra Energy insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for NextEra Energy you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The Mastercard Economics Institute’s ""Shifting Wallets"" report looks at how consumers across the world are holding tight to habits that offer convenience, experience or both.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220928005769/en/Mastercard Economics Institute: Shifting wallets, new consumer spending habits (Graphic: Business Wire)The latest Mastercard Economics Institute report applies unique and high-frequency economic measurements to answer three key questions — what, where and when — consumers are shifting their spending preferences. Key findings include:What: With higher prices forcing consumers to rebalance their discretionary and essential spending, travel and food have reigned supreme in discourse in recent years.Consumers continue to prioritize travel. Global consumer flight bookings this summer (May-August) were 15% above 2019 levels, despite heightened logistical challenges and price pressures. 2Short haul flights fuel most of the travel growth globally (+20% compared to long) 3 except in European countries where travelers have good alternatives to flying for shorter trips.The ease of eating out draws diners. Restaurant spending was up 25% this year compared to the same time in 2021, while grocery spending—largely fueled by food inflation—was up 14%.4When looking at longer term trends, online grocery spend is up 70% above the pre-pandemic trend, while in-person grocery spend sits 25% above.1 This speaks to the pandemic-fueled shift to digital and the stickiness of convenience-based spending.Story continuesWhere: Small businesses bore the brunt of pandemic-related closures, as they tried to rapidly shift online.Small businesses show gains in online services. Small online services businesses—think tax preparation, tutoring and personal care services—are growing 1.5-2x faster than large online services businesses. 5 This is especially true in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Italy, and Singapore.Large retailers dramatically outperform small businesses in the shift to digital. In the retail sector, e-commerce sales for large businesses grew 66% versus 27% for small businesses in August compared to 2019.6 The gap is particularly evident in more developed economies like Australia, Germany, Hong Kong and Singapore.When: Gone are designated days for spending. Working from home and the shift to digital have blurred the lines, and date night is apparently now any night. This has significant staffing and supply chain implications for retailers, restaurants and other businesses.Both goods and experiences spending shifts into weekdays. Globally, roughly 5% of total weekend spending at department stores has shifted into the weekday. This represents roughly $22.3 billion USD of global department store sales.7In the U.S., a clear weekend to weekday shift in spending at movie theatres, where a cumulative 3 percentage points have shifted away from Saturdays and Sundays into the weekdays – mostly on Thursdays and, to a lesser extent, Mondays too.""The shifts in spending preferences come as consumers settle in to a new rhythm,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, Mastercard chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute. ""Despite contending with rising prices, interest rates and growing economic uncertainty, consumers continue to evaluate their spending habits based on what works best for their lives.""You can view the full Shifting Wallets: New consumer spending habits report here.

But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 100% the gain in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 18% drop, in the last year.In light of the stock dropping 8.6% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Mastercard achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Mastercard has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Mastercard, it has a TSR of 106% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Mastercard shares lost 18% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.We will like Mastercard better if we see some big insider buys.

Traveloka, backed by investors including GIC Pte and Expedia Group Inc., is considering an initial public offering in the US or in Indonesia, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous discussing a private matter.The fresh funds strengthen Traveloka’s balance sheet and allow it to invest in its core business, President Caesar Indra said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin, David Ingles and Rishaad Salamat in Singapore on Friday.Southeast Asia’s tourism industry plunged into crisis during the pandemic when lockdowns all but brought travel to a halt. Traveloka ventured into financial services during the pandemic by partnering with banks including PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia and PT Bank Negara Indonesia. Representatives for the startup declined to comment.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysThe revenue of Southeast Asian online travel agents (OTAs) might gain from the speedy rebound in domestic and international travel in the region, helped by high smartphone ownership and low penetration of brick-and-mortar travel agencies. We expect industry leader Traveloka to grow faster than rivals such as Tripadvisor and Booking Holdings, with our scenario projecting sales to expand by more than 40% from 2021-25 vs. the industry’s 36%. Traveloka, along with Indonesia’s Tiket.com, appears more able to weather industry challenges, the most crucial of which is achieving profitability amid IPO plans.Story continues- Nathan Naidu, analystClick here for the research.Many countries are now removing pandemic-era restrictions and reopening borders. For example, Thailand -- where international tourism contributes about 12% to gross domestic product -- has seen a rush of foreign travelers in recent months after scrapping restrictions in July.Traveloka envisages a full recovery from the pandemic by 2024, Indra said. “We are very optimistic that domestic travel will drive the recovery, followed by international recovery,” he said.Regional startups are raising funds despite worries about a global economic downturn, hoping to position themselves for an eventual rebound. Traveloka helps consumers book a range of services including airline tickets and hotels as well as spas and tourism attractions. It also offers food delivery and financing, payment and insurance products. Its app has been downloaded more than 100 million times, according to its website.The valuation of the deal is unclear.

Barry Diller, the senior executive at both Expedia Group and IAC, thinks many Environmental, Social and Governance programs amount to “empty calories,” remote work options have been foisted on corporations by a few California tech companies, and the mid-term elections in the U.S. could be a “grim” precursor to the Presidential vote in 2024.Skift Editor-In-Chief Tom Lowry interviewed Diller on these and many other travel-related topics on stage at Skift Global Forum 2022 in Manhattan on September 20.Diller said the several-year-old reorganization of Expedia Group has revolutionized the company, that the future of the casino hotel is bright, and airfares and hotel rates will have to get lower.Watch the full video of the conversation and you can read the transcript, as well, below.Interview TranscriptBarry Diller: What are you supposed to do with these? They look like you could eat them. Oh God. All right. Hello.Tom Lowry: There’s a price to pay for design forward, Barry.Diller: Oh yeah, backwards.Lowry: Welcome to Skift Global Forum.Diller: Thank you.Lowry: Great to see you again, in person this time.Diller: Thank you. This is everybody.Lowry: The last time we spoke was September of 2020. That was less than six months after the start of the pandemic. And you were quite adamant, at that time, about people returning to the office to work. If we were to go outside right now and go the 30 blocks down IAC’s headquarters…Diller: Wasteland.Lowry: … south of here, and we walk through the door, what would we see in IAC today?Diller: You wouldn’t see too many people. You’d see big open spaces with relatively few people in. First of all, the concept work from home is stupid when you think about it. This started, obviously, because of we were all shut in so nobody could go to work. But the idea that, and mostly done by the tech companies in California, which started this absurdity of three days, three and two, which is basically a four day weekend. There’s actually been no real thinking about this. You can only do this in a granular way, which means if you’ve got a workforce of thousands of people, then there are relatively few that can genuinely do work outside of the office and only touch the office very occasionally. But, you really have got to do it granularly.Story continuesAny mass concept of three days or two days, or we must come on, now you must come on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for sure. And Wednesdays are optional and whatever. We had this imposed on us. It didn’t come out of a lot of really thoughtful work on, all right, how does work get performed with these new tools that are available? It got pushed on us. And I think that we’ve just, because of the job market and because of, basically, these surveys asking employees what they think is really insane, asking employees what they would like to do, they will all answer you, “I want to work for home from home and I want to get paid more money. Thank you. Leave me alone.”Lowry: Right.Diller: OK. But, who would pay attention to that?Lowry: Some might characterize that as an old school way of thinking, Barry.Diller: I think it’s new school. Thank you.Lowry: Do you worry about your competitors?Diller: The problem look is in every conversation I’ve had about this in my own companies is, “We can’t do that because we’ll lose employees to X or Y.” You have every company saying, “We’ll lose employees to X and Y,” which renders the whole thing kind of meaningless. If you operate a company and you want people to grow in it, if you want people to get promoted, there’s hardly much vitality or inspiration sitting at a laptop computer on a dining room table. I don’t know how you get people, if you have a culture, if your company’s lucky enough to have some culture and most successful companies do, how you get that without people being in a communal arena is almost impossible. How do you get promoted?”Lowry: Did you implement a policy at IAC?Diller: No, I’m hopeless. I’ve not.Lowry: No?Diller: I’ve tried. I’ve made them maybe a little better, but mostly it’s, “You can’t do that because of this or that.” I said, “OK, I’m up for this four and three concept, except Mondays and Fridays have to be mandatory attendance.” They looked at me as if I had lost my mind. They said, “No one will work for us.” I said, “Oh really? Why is that?” And they said, “Mondays and Fridays, those are the days that people want to work from home.” Why is that? It’s all a crock.Lowry: Let’s move on to corporate travel, which is related to what we’re talking about. This morning, Skift posted a deep dive story by our corporate travel editor, Matt Parsons, and the headline was In Search of Corporate Travel’s Elusive Recovery, which pulled together all the prognostications about whether travel would come back fully or whether it’s just going to come back partially.Diller: But will.Lowry: What is the future of corporate travel? And what are your views on that?Diller: Back and growing. Not necessarily this year, maybe a little more next year. But, the year after that and for years on, yes. Corporate travel will completely be back. Why wouldn’t it be? You have all these facilities, all these places around the world that are organized for people in business to come to travel to. There’s such an incredible infrastructure for it. And it will, of course, return. We are still coming out of, it’s very hard, I think, for any of us, living in the moment does obscure things. We don’t realize the incredible impact of a year of imposed relative isolation. In all areas. Corporate travel is going to be fine.Lowry: You mentioned earlier that you’ve done a ton of traveling even through the pandemic. How about your team? Are they up and running and are budgets still the same?Diller: Yes. In terms of traveling, for sure.Lowry: Do you think there’re some companies that might look at that differently? That a CFO is now looking at what the savings was over the last two years and change their mind.Diller: They can look at all the savings they like, but there is an imperative to see your customers, to be out in the world, to be visiting other places that have businesses either similar to yours or those you want to enter. That will push against it. And I think for successful companies, they’ll force the budgets. Or they’ll tell their CFO to be quiet.Lowry: Let’s talk Expedia. You’re the chairman. Peter Kern is the vice chairman and CEO and he’ll be on this stage tomorrow talking about what’s going on in Expedia. Let me ask you, at the next board meeting, will you say, “Peter, let’s pick this up. Let’s pick this up.”Diller: I don’t think you can pick it up anymore than we’re picking it up. We’ve, basically, in the last couple of years, revolutionized the company. We’ve gone from a very complex, very siloed operation with endless duplications, seven different checkout paths for different properties of ours, multiple platforms, et cetera, into making Expedia one tech platform. Basically, redesigning every single crook in the machine. And it is performing now, obviously, far better. Again, we had this imposed in an odd way. We were doing it anyway. We had decided, before the pandemic, that we were, so to speak, a bloated operation and that we were going to see to that. Obviously, the COVID accelerated that. So we dropped from 25,000 employees to 17,000 or something like that. It’s leaner, it’s more efficient, it’s more capable of productivity and it is growing in any terms.Lowry: It sounds like you’re satisfied with the pace of the restructuring?Diller: No. How could I ever say I’m satisfied with anything? That’d be a disaster. That would just make the people who work with me happy.Lowry: Okay. We’ll be sure to pass that on to Peter tomorrow.Diller: Do.Lowry: Right before the pandemic, you (IAC) took an investment in MGM Resorts.Diller: Yes.Lowry: Which was largely…Diller: Not right before, during. Quite during.Lowry: Largely a bet on online gaming and sports betting?Diller: No, it was a bet. It was certainly that we thought we had some expertise in online activity that they did not have. And we thought we could spur that along. Not that they didn’t think optimistically about it, but we thought even more optimistically. But, what struck me is their infrastructure. In Las Vegas alone, 468 restaurants, 150 performance venues from 20 some odd thousand seats down to thousands, seven or eight million feet of convention space, 11 properties on the strip of Las Vegas. More than 40 percent of every transaction that goes through Las Vegas goes through one of our properties. I was just knocked out by that and by what I thought could help that begin to innovate, which had not really happened for some time in Las Vegas.Lowry: Last month you boosted your stake to 16 percent?Diller: I’m not sure the exact percentages.Lowry: What did you see that changed your mind?Diller: Changed my mind? What do you mean changed my mind?Lowry: Just in terms of your confidence in the investment?Diller: I wasn’t unconfident. I began confident and as we got into it, I got even more confident. And we’ve been buying, in addition to our initial purchase, throughout the last year. And we’ll continue to do so.Lowry: Are there other opportunities for you in that space, in the gaming space?Diller: I think the opportunities for us are inside our MGM investment, not outside of it. And that is, I just think it’s an extraordinary opportunity. I mean those you, of course, know Las Vegas is doing extraordinarily well. Will it continue if there’s a recession? It’ll probably go through a cycle. But, the opportunities, and particularly as online opportunities worldwide, are immense.Lowry: As more gaming moves online, do you think the notion or the idea of the casino hotel faces some sort of extinction?Diller: Not at all. I think it faces enhancement because the relationship between being able to do games and things in sports betting and all sorts of gambling online connects you to the bricks and mortar resort hotel, et cetera, in all sorts of ways that have not been able to be done before. No, I think they benefit each other.Lowry: One of the topics that we have been running an awful lot about over the last two years is sustainability and pledges that companies are making towards sustainability and their ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) initiatives.Diller: Yes. Come into my room.Lowry: How much of this will end up being rhetoric and how much will be real action, Barry?Diller: I think it’s difficult for the travel business. Travel business by its very nature is not, quote, in the sustainability business. Meaning if what you’re after is reduced carbon footprint, in order to travel, you got to get someplace, and that’s going to eat up that, it’s going to increase that. Resorts and things are not, of course, they’re not particularly carbon neutral, but they can offset it to some degree. But, most of ESG is virtue signaling, I’m afraid. And it’s nothing terrible about it.It’s sensitized everybody to a whole host of issues that are worth paying attention to. Expedia, for instance, is now paying real attention to audiences that have not really had access before in different generic groups and different all sorts of definitions. That’s good. And we’re also doing another thing, which again it’s small beer, I think, but we’re trying to promote places that are not on everybody’s hit map for selfies and whatever. Because when you get into sustainability and you think of overrun places that are big, big attractions, that’s hitting at it. And so to try and help popularize other less trodden places is a good thing. I don’t think it’ll have much impact on, quote, sustainability. But, there it is.Lowry: Some critics have called it, not Skift’s phrase, but their phrase woke capitalism. Larry Fink at BlackRock got himself caught in the crosshairs of that recently.Diller: Crossing back quickly as he can.Lowry: Do you think so called woke capitalism has gone too far?Diller: Yes, of course I do.Lowry: Can you elaborate on that?Diller: No, I mean yes. Can I? Any bird brain can tell you that most of the things that are instead of are in support of that really don’t make very much sense. Yes, to be more aware of your surroundings of people, et cetera, more sensitized, that’s a nice thing. But, all of the woke rules, I shouldn’t say all of them, most of those woke rules have no brain in them. And so I think that it’s been popular for a while. Just talk about pendulums. It’s naturally beginning to swing back, meaning that there’s a lot of people who were afraid to speak out about it.Listen, what Larry Fink said and led America’s companies to do with, quote, ESG for several years was above criticism. And people would frightened to death to criticize it because they get slammed everywhere. I think people are now saying, “Let’s make some real sense of this.” Given that most ESG programs, most of them, not all of them, there are some very specific things that people have done, companies have done, that make great good sense. But, the mass of them are truly empty calories. They’re just a lot of people employed by these companies to write glossy reports that generate nothing but glossy reports.Lowry:Who do you think is getting it right? Can you give us a company?Diller:I actually think that some of the energy companies are, many of the energy companies, are beginning to get it right. When you talk about the big issue, in practical terms, they’re at the crux of it. And so that has, I think, changed a lot. I think, generally, other than sensitizing people, and I think sensitizing people is always a good thing, I don’t think this ESG movement has amounted to very much. Again, except reports.Lowry: Let’s talk about the global economy. You obviously keep a close eye on that. It’s far from certain what’s going to happen over the next year or so with the war in Ukraine, pop threats of recession. What are your thoughts and what sort of makes you a little bit nervous?Diller: Except for certain places, the obvious places, the economy is very strong. Our economy is very strong. You can get any dope to give you their predictions about when this recession will come. You only know that the big issue is inflation. That is the issue, economic issue. And attempts have to be made in every way to get it down. We cannot live with inflation, sustaining or increasing. And so interest rates will rise. The result of that has to be that there will be some somewhat of an r, uncapitalized, hopefully, recession at some point. But, not soon. Meaning soon, I don’t think certainly… Well, the year’s almost over. Maybe ’23? Look, if the Fed keep raising rates, it’s an inevitability that you’ve got to get a slow down. Again, maybe a little r, some r. But, it’ll be something like that. We have lived through endless cycles of recession, strong or weak or whatever. Okay, there is pain, but we will plow through it. I don’t care very much.Lowry: What implication would a recession with a small r have coming after what we’ve just been through the last two years?Diller: We haven’t been through a recession. We’ve been through enormous growth beginning about a year ago. Many, many companies are back to ’19 levels and exceeding them. In our vacation rentals business, VRBO, we’ve been exceeding ’19 for a year or more. Will hotel room prices sustain at this level? No, they can’t. They’re too high. We all know that they will have to come down. Will air travel prices stay at this level? No, they can’t. They will also come down over time. Those have effects. For consumers, they’re good effects.Lowry: The last time we spoke, it was about six weeks shy of the 2020 presidential election.Diller: Yes.Lowry: And you described that, at the time, there’s an anvil hanging over our heads. President Biden was elected. Here we are again. We’re facing a midterm elections. What do you think the state of the country and democracy right now?Diller: My God, my God. I don’t real much care about the midterms. The only worry I have is that if we elect people who deny the 2020 election or say the election was a fraud, which we are in danger of doing in many places, to me, that is the enormous danger. If you have people who we willingly elect, who actually denied that that election was a fraud, God knows what’s going to happen when the big ticket comes in ’24, which is the real great fear. My worry about this midterm, and I think it’s a little better than it was, certainly for the only side that denies the election are the Republicans. Obviously, they lost so who would do it? But, the idea that you would actually, institutionally deny it and every single person who’s gotten that, whatever you would might call him, fill in the horrible blank, Trump.Everybody who’s gotten his endorsement has had to pledge, one, that they will come out publicly and say the election was a fraud. And two, they’ll commit to reverse it. How do you like that one? That’s my worry because that presages the big game in ’24 when it’s incomprehensible to me that we would reelect Donald Trump. But, we might. Or we might have real, real difficulty, either side. People who say that this upcoming election will be fraudulent. Everybody’s going to stick a claim on either side. If the prospects are really grim for what might happen in ’24. And ’22 is a precursor. Of course, many things will change in the two years. I won’t say what I hope will happen.Lowry: Wince we have these sit downs every two years and the election cycle is here, will you come back in 2024 and talk about?Diller: I’ll come back in two years.Lowry: I want to shift gears really quickly to wrap up, Barry. So Yvon Chouinard at Patagonia made a lot of news last week, giving away his company to put everything into the climate.Diller: Extraordinary.Lowry: You and your wife, Diane von Furstenberg, have been philanthropists forever through your foundation.Diller: Yes. We are lucky we can be.Lowry: Would you ever consider a similar type of move that Yvon Chouinard announced last week?Diller: I think I’m really charitable. I’m not that charitable.Lowry: We have about a minute left. Do you want to give a plug to the Little Island?Diller: No, not plug to it. It’s down the street. Go visit it. It’s crowded but it’s awfully nice.Lowry:For those that don’t know. What was it, $260 million investment?Diller: Yeah.Lowry: And what was the old Pier 50?Diller: It was Pier 54 and they were tearing it down. And so we got very ambitious, architecturally, and did the stupidest thing that you can do is to build an island in the waters of the Hudson River. But by the way, we did it. It’s there. It’s nice. Go visit it.Lowry: Great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.Diller: Pleasure. Nice to be with you all.Lowry: Pleasure always.Diller: Thank you.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

RTX recently announced a contract involving AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $15.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide depot-level repair capability for the government of Kuwait’s inventory of AN/APG-79 AESA radar weapon replaceable assemblies.The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in El Segundo, CA.Significance of AN/APG-79 RadarsAN/APG-79 radars deliver increased air-to-air and air-to-surface targeting and tracking capabilities through the near speed of light beam steering. The APG-79 may be tailored to fit any platform's size, space and requirement, particularly for legacy aircraft.This radar’s solid demand can be gauged from the fact that it is currently in full-rate production for the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, with Raytheon delivering more than 700 systems to F/A-18 Super Hornet and Growler squadrons.Radars &amp; RaytheonWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, developed and developing nations have been boosting their defense arsenal significantly. Radars constitute a vital part of their defense equipment. While radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, nowadays, they are being used for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, air traffic control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.Demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like a rise in defense spending of emerging economies, an increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft. These, in turn, have been benefiting radar manufacturing companies like Raytheon in the form of contract wins like the latest one.Story continuesNotably, Raytheon’s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-SPY 6, AN-TPY-2, APG-79, APG-82 are some of its combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market.Growth ProspectsPer Fortune Business Insights firm, the global military radar market is expected to reach $22.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2021. Such growth projections for the aforementioned market should benefit prominent radar manufacturers like Raytheon Technologies, Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and Northrop Grumman NOC.Notably, Northrop is a pioneer in Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and has been at the forefront of AESA innovations for more than 60 years. The company’s broad portfolio of products comprises radars like AN/APG-83 scalable, agile beam radar, AN/ASQ-236 Dragon’s eye radar pod as well as AN/APG-81 and AN/APG-71 for F-35 and F-22 jets, respectively.Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 sales indicates an improvement of 1.9% from the 2021 reported figure.Among Lockheed Martin’s notable radar portfolio, the significant ones include SPY-7, AN/TPQ-53 radar system and AN/APY-9 radar.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock has gained 13.5% in the past year. Similarly, L3Harris is the manufacturing company for AN/SPS-48G naval radar, Symphony Airfield Radar Systems and Tactical Air Surveillance radars and a few more.L3 Harris boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Raytheon Technologies’ shares have lost 6.8% compared with the industry’s 11.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. PulteGroup (PHM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.81 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 25, 2022.PulteGroup's Earnings ESP sits at 1.75%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.81 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76.PHM is part of a big group of Construction stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Boise Cascade (BCC) as well.Slated to report earnings on November 7, 2022, Boise Cascade holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.60 a share 40 days from its next quarterly update.Boise Cascade's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3.29% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.45.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, PHM and BCC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the WEC Energy Group share price has climbed 49% in five years, easily topping the market return of 40% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 11% in the last year , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, WEC Energy Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.2% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 8% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on WEC Energy Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, WEC Energy Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 73%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that WEC Energy Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with WEC Energy Group (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.WEC Energy Group is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

(NYSE: WM) outperforming in such an environment.Waste Management – Company ProfileWaste Management, Inc provides waste management environmental services to customers in North America. It operates 260 landfills, 96 material recovery facilities (MRF), 5 secure hazardous waste landfills, and 340 transfer stations.The company is vertically integrated to handle everything from collection to disposal and runs 15,500 collection routes. Alongside Republic Services (NYSE: RSG), the company is the leader in the solid waste management sector, running half of the largest landfills in the US.In recent times, Waste Management grew through several acquisitions – the most prominent one being Advanced Disposal, for which the company paid US$4.9b in 2019. Currently, the company is set to acquire a controlling interest in Avangard Innovetive's US business, adding an estimated 400 million pounds per year of postconsumer resin and expanding its operation in the Midwest.Waste Management vs. Republic ServicesWaste is a co-product of any growth. Thus these 2 companies grew along with the economy. Although environmental pressures have been growing over the years, a growing economy finds it hard to reduce the amount of waste it produces.

WM scores an advantage in the current growth forecast, as well as in higher returns on capital.Story continuesOperating in the capital-intensive industry, both companies carry considerable debt, but it seems it doesn't hinder their growth so far. Scratching below the surface, we see that WM looks ahead with better cash flow coverage (33.1% vs. 24.5%) and better EBIT coverage (9.1x vs. 6.9x).  WM vs RSG Valuation September 29, 2022  Both companies are paying a dividend that isn't notable, but it is higher than average in this sector. These dividends are growing steadily and have a modest payout ratio.Valuation – The Elephant in the RoomWarren Buffett famously said, „Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.“ According to him, the greatest danger might not be buying a company with poor prospects but rather overpaying for a company with good prospects.Both companies trade at a significant premium to the industry and broad market in general. Their valuation is at the point where it seems like its relative advantage in the ongoing market condition is priced in. Although our discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis points to some upside, WM still has a high price sticker – albeit at a better relative value to its biggest competitor, RSG.If you're unsure about the strength of Waste Management's business, you might want to explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:MRK) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-ownership-merck-co-inc-140111622.html,1664373671,STORY,['MRK'],"[If you want to know who really controls Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Merck. See our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Merck's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Merck. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Merck &amp; Co., Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$165m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Merck better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Merck .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

A sign in one of the photos said ""C919 aircraft type certificate issuance ceremony"" in Chinese.COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The C919, launched 14 years ago and designed to carry up to 168 passengers, will compete against the popular Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX families in the world's second-biggest aviation market as China looks to boost its technological self-reliance amid trade tensions.Although the plane is assembled in China, it relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics, from companies including GE, Safran and Honeywell International.Tough U.S. export licensing rules have led to delays in sourcing parts and remain a key risk to ramped up production until China replaces foreign engines and components with homegrown technology.Richard Aboulafia, U.S.-based managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said the plane seems like a relic of a bygone era of increasing integration between China and the West.""Thus, we have an aircraft that is only superficially Chinese but is actually powered by Western technologies and systems,"" he said.

A sign in one of the photos said ""C919 aircraft type certificate issuance ceremony"" in Chinese.COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The C919, launched 14 years ago and designed to carry up to 168 passengers, will compete against the popular Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX families in the world's second-biggest aviation market as China looks to boost its technological self-reliance amid trade tensions.Although the plane is assembled in China, it relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics, from companies including GE, Safran and Honeywell International.Tough U.S. export licensing rules have led to delays in sourcing parts and remain a key risk to ramped up production until China replaces foreign engines and components with homegrown technology.Richard Aboulafia, U.S.-based managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said the plane seems like a relic of a bygone era of increasing integration between China and the West.""Thus, we have an aircraft that is only superficially Chinese but is actually powered by Western technologies and systems,"" he said.

So great to have you on the show here. So for people who are wondering, perhaps, they want to invest in some of this new technology, talk about some of the holdings in this ETF and how investors can get in on this.LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, so Robo Global, the company, built Robo, our robotics and automation ETF, almost a decade ago. So we're investing across the entire ecosystem of robotics and automation, so really looking at automation as a megatrend. About half the portfolio, actually about 60%, is in areas where we can apply these robotics technologies. And about 40% is the technology, the sensing and computing actuation, AI, and integration-- the technology underneath the robots.So we believe that you should really own the whole ecosystem of automation because while automation is relentless, it's not perhaps moving sector by sector in lockstep. So sometimes you're catching really great growth, really great opportunities. Right now, logistics automation, you want to talk Amazon. Logistics automation is something we're also excited about. And you want to also own the companies in 3D printing that maybe are not so much seeing the fad like they were maybe five years ago, but are an integral part of the automation ecosystem.SEANA SMITH: Lauren, there certainly are so many players in this space, even more companies jumping in, it seems, like on a daily basis when it comes to automation. How are you picking out the winner since it is such a broad spectrum?LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, yeah, so we look at the 11 subsectors that we really think make up the automation ecosystem. And we look for market leaders in those sectors, for technology leaders in those sectors. So we want to really populate the entire spectrum with leaders. We want to talk about-- let's talk about warehouse automation. 20% of the warehouses in the United States are only using some amount of automation today.Story continuesSo we look at a company that's going to be able to really penetrate that market and provide solutions there. We want to talk about logistics automation. We're going to talk about companies like-- Machine Vision is going to be a key part of that, so Cognex and Keyence from Japan and Samsara. Ultimately, we don't care where a company is located. We just care that they're leaders in some component of the automation megatrend.DAVE BRIGGS: Pre-pandemic automation was viewed as really a threat to jobs not just here, but around the world. But how is the employment shortage in just about every field imaginable actually contributing to the growth of some of these companies?LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, I think McKinsey said that there were-- 88% of the companies that they surveyed last year said that they're going to employ some sort of automation technology. The obvious places to think are going to be manufacturing and some sort of warehouse. I mean, gosh, Amazon's attrition rate last year was like 160%. So you've got to start thinking that robots can do some of these jobs.Obviously, with wage inflation, automation is going to solve that problem to some extent, make the investment in robots, and then you've got some sort of cost control there, as opposed to the variability of labor. But there are-- robots are not going to replace people everywhere. Cobots is also a major industry, and cobots are going to work alongside people, just things that we can't do with just the machine.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Lauren, I want to ask you about supply chain challenges. Obviously, not just for things like the chips that go into this technology, but even the materials, some of these commodities that we see that are required that are needed for growth in some of these industries. What are you watching in that space? And how concerned are you that some of these supply chain issues still haven't been resolved yet?LAUREN HEIN: So the supply chain issues are especially hairy for some of the companies in the manufacturing or capital goods side of the robo ETF companies like FANUC, Daifuku, Kardex even. Like, these companies are trying to meet the demand for robots and robotics, but they're just having issues getting not just semiconductors, but they're also having trouble getting component parts like sensors and other types of actuators.It's just been an ongoing issue. They're not able to meet the demand for this-- for the orders that they have right now. So you're actually having sales growth continue to climb. But these companies in the robotics manufacturing space just not being able to meet their current orders.So it's ongoing. You will see some reshoring, obviously, here in the US. We're really leaning into manufacturing our own chips and the semiconductor fabs that were estimating to build, I think, 10 over the next two years as part of the Chips Act that we passed this summer. So, yes, the supply chain is an ongoing concern. But it's going to take a few years to resolve.]"

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.Cigna could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Cigna.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Cigna's is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 27% decrease to the company's bottom line. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 53% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Cigna's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.What We Can Learn From Cigna's P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Cigna maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $15.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide depot-level repair capability for the government of Kuwait’s inventory of AN/APG-79 AESA radar weapon replaceable assemblies.The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in El Segundo, CA.Significance of AN/APG-79 RadarsAN/APG-79 radars deliver increased air-to-air and air-to-surface targeting and tracking capabilities through the near speed of light beam steering. The APG-79 may be tailored to fit any platform's size, space and requirement, particularly for legacy aircraft.This radar’s solid demand can be gauged from the fact that it is currently in full-rate production for the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, with Raytheon delivering more than 700 systems to F/A-18 Super Hornet and Growler squadrons.Radars &amp; RaytheonWith the rapid escalation of geopolitical tensions globally in recent times, developed and developing nations have been boosting their defense arsenal significantly. Radars constitute a vital part of their defense equipment. While radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, nowadays, they are being used for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, air traffic control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.Demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like a rise in defense spending of emerging economies, an increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft. These, in turn, have been benefiting radar manufacturing companies like Raytheon in the form of contract wins like the latest one.Story continuesNotably, Raytheon’s product portfolio consists of varied radars like integrated air and missile defense radars, ballistic missile radars, surveillance radars as well as air dominance radars. Radars like AN-SPY 6, AN-TPY-2, APG-79, APG-82 are some of its combat-proven products that enjoy solid demand in the global military radar market.Growth ProspectsPer Fortune Business Insights firm, the global military radar market is expected to reach $22.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 6.3% from 2021.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, long term Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shareholders have enjoyed a 63% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 37% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 34% in the last year , including dividends .While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Northrop Grumman achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Northrop Grumman has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Northrop Grumman, it has a TSR of 76% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Northrop Grumman shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Northrop Grumman better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Some believe Nike will also lower its own current sales forecast on Thursday.THE CONTEXTNike saw its fortunes grow during the pandemic as sweatpants and joggers became a more intrinsic part of everyday fashion, while demand for the company's running shoes and sportswear surged from people taking up more outdoor exercises.However, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions has shifted some of that spending back to more formal and social occasion-based apparel, while overall demand takes a hit from decades-high inflation.That comes as concerns grow about the pace of recovery in China where the government's Zero-COVID policy lockdowns dampen demand in the region, which accounts for about 17% of Nike's annual sales.Story continuesRival Adidas also slashed its full-year earnings target in July, citing a slower-than-expected recovery in China from pandemic restrictions.Still, some analysts are more bullish about Nike's business in North America, citing an improving supply chain and a better inventory position.""Nike products generally continue to sell through at high prices with fewer promotions in North America and Europe. The pricing data also suggests Nike's inventory levels are mostly well-controlled,"" UBS analyst Jay Sole said, citing UBS Evidence Lab pricing data.THE FUNDAMENTALS* First-quarter revenue estimates have declined to $12.27 billion from $12.32 billion since the start of September* Full-year earnings per share estimates have also fallen to $3.66 from $3.74, according to IBES data from Refinitiv* The blue-chip stock is one of the worst Dow 30performers this year, down about 42%, compared with the index's18.6% fall.WALL STREET SENTIMENT* The current average analyst rating on NKE shares is ""buy"", with 24 rating it ""strong buy"" or ""buy"", 10 rating it a ""hold"" and two rating it a ""sell"" or ""strong sell"".* The mean price target is $128.28, down from $166.67 at the start of January(Reporting by Mehr Bedi in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like NIKE (NYSE:NKE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for NIKE NIKE's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. NIKE managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. NIKE maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.9% to US$47b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for NIKE?Are NIKE Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of NIKE, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$30b. That equates to 20% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. So there is opportunity here to invest in a company whose management have tangible incentives to deliver.Story continuesDoes NIKE Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of NIKE is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Now, you could try to make up your mind on NIKE by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

That give and take has helped keep VF current, showing a willingness to keep up with the market (one of the areas where Vans is now actively playing catchup).“We’re committed to continually shape this company,” Rendle said. “While we have one of our key brands that is not achieving its potential, every other one of our brands, the 11 other brands, are achieving at or greater than their commitments. We are deeply committed to growth.”Steve RendleThe company’s overall strategy has been more updated than changed — focusing in on a deep commitment to customers and then using its business platforms to drive growth.Story continuesVF, however, did get a new vision statement.“We are committed to be the world’s most dynamic portfolio of deeply loved, iconic active-lifestyle brands,” Rendle said. “That vision has been born by a commitment to provide absolute clarity to our teams on who we intend to be, most importantly, the strategic investments that we’re prepared to drive behind. Every brand in this portfolio plays a very specific role, both strategically and financially to help us achieve our results.”Those results — through fiscal year 2027 — call for revenues to grow at a compounded annual growth rate in the mid- to high-single digits, as earnings per share expand high-single to low-double digits, on a percentage basis.Now that Supreme has been integrated into VF, the brand is set to start contributing more to growth.Susie Mulder, who is global brand president of Timberland, and the company’s liaison to Supreme’s management, noted that the brand is “100 percent direct-to-consumer” and available in 40 countries through 14 flagships and three owned websites.(VF plans to take a $300 million to $450 million non-cash charge on Supreme’s trademark and goodwill in the second quarter, which is not tied to the brand’s business or operations but to “a triggering event that is the result of higher interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations, which are expected to negatively affect the estimated fair values”).“We often get the question, ‘What is the Supreme business model? What makes Supreme Supreme?’” she said. “I’m going to try to explain that in one slide.”That slide simply described the brand as authentic, scarce, global and agile.“Unlike many businesses, Supreme is global, each season we produce one product assortment globally, it’s identical in every market and it creates a shared experience across the worldwide community,” she said.And that community is going to be seeing more of Supreme, which is going to start spending on brand building and plans to double its 2020 footprint over the next five years with a “grow wide” strategy.That started with news that Supreme would open a store in Chicago as well in Dover Street Market in Beijing.But Mulder said Supreme would stick to its knitting while evolving and growing.“This is a brand that always listens to culture and, as we know, culture is moving,” she said.As Supreme and VF’s other brands chart growth for the future, there’s some tough terrain on the nearer horizon.VF said its second-quarter results are coming in lower than expected and revised its outlook for this year. Total revenue is expected to be up 5 percent to 6 percent in constant currencies, instead of the at least 7 percent gain seen earlier. Vans’ revenues are now seen down mid-single digits as opposed to the mid-single digit projected earlier.And adjusted earnings per share are seen at $2.60 to $2.70 this year, down from $3.18 last year and the prior outlook of $3.05 to $3.15.Kevin Bailey, who is global brand president at Vans and returned to the business earlier this year, told analysts the brand was refreshing, refocusing and accelerating.Bailey said the brand — which grew from $2 billion in sales in 2017 to $4 billion in 2019 — had failed to keep up with the youth culture it caters to and relied too much on its classic looks.“Vans is far from done in our growth potential,” Bailey said. “We are rooted in youth and skateboarding. We are refreshing our strategy now to grow and expanding beyond those perceptions.”He noted that surf and snow are also important and, along with skateboarding, are set to get a boost now that they’re all part of the Olympic lineup.Apparel is also going to be getting more attention, building to a big launch for next fall, Bailey said.While the meeting was largely upbeat and focused on the future of VF, it started on a dour personal note with Rendle acknowledging the passing of The North Face team captain and ski mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, whose body was recovered Wednesday morning after a fall in Nepal earlier this week.“It is a hard day, it’s been a hard last couple days,” said Rendle, noting analysts at the meeting would pick that up from The North Face employees at the meeting. “Hilaree was really our superhero and she provided so much passion and so much energy that we drew from. We’re sad and the grieving begins.”]"

That is the maker, of course, of Timberland and North Face after the company revised its full year outlook for 2023 due to lower than expected results in the second quarter. And I made a joke off camera, but to me, it holds true. Whenever you see a company come out, I think, with a five-year growth target inside of a stock market that is completely melting down, it just usually suggests that near-term is going to be a lot of pressure in this business.Now, VF Corp has some incredibly strong brands, but look, that guidance was taken down, what, close to $0.40, Julie, compared to prior estimates. Challenging quarter, and not a good look, I think, ahead of those Nike earnings that come later in the week because these companies, by and large, if I'm going to buy a North Face black, just hoodie, next to it is probably something from Nike.BRAD SMITH: Look, well, for Nike, they've been trying to move out of some of those partnerships where they're in the same space as a Vans, North Face, Timberland, and Dickies brands. And what it does signal, though, is even with a Nike exit from some of those retail partnerships on the wholesale side of their business, for what VF Corporation is now talking about, for Vans, North Face, Timberland, Dickies, they're also still trying to go to direct to consumer.And so if you're seeing both a hit on the wholesale side and a hit on the direct to consumer side, it's essentially going to shape up to exactly what VF Corporation is pointing out here across those brands, saying that they see the economic uncertainties persist, actively addressing challenges within their business. And I think that this is just going to be more of that investment story in their existing customer base, while they're not sure exactly where the marketing spend is going to be able to continue to go forward to acquire new customers.Story continuesWhat does that mean for partnerships? I've seen Dickies in everything from Walmart growing up, to Target now, too. And if you're looking at the type of consumer you're going after and also thinking about where they're pulling back in some of their discretionary spendings, did they lean in to a North Face or a Timberland? Or did they say, you know what? Target's got some of the same stuff, too. Perhaps VF Corporation can capitalize on that. But really be hard pressed to believe that right now, with the five-year growth plan, there's anything to really be optimistic about.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'll just mention, too, it's a very good point. And something to, I think, look out for this earnings season, VF Corp noting their guidance that they just lowered for fiscal year 2023 doesn't account for no-- doesn't-- no significant worsening in global inflation rates and consumer sentiment. So theoretically, if we get a next leg lower in this economy-- we do enter a full blown recession-- our companies like a VF Corp and even industrial companies-- you name it-- are they prepared to lower again? And I think that's what you're seeing in the markets just that--JULIE HYMAN: Well--BRIAN SOZZI: --macro, just that economic and profit uncertainty for companies.JULIE HYMAN: Except you're not seeing it in VF Corp today. The shares are not down very much at all. They're already down 52% this year. And if you look at the longer term targets, they're actually not too bad in terms of the growth they're expecting in the various brands. Maybe that's cushioning the blow. I'll have to look more at the commentary around.BRAD SMITH: I just remain skeptical, when the company says in its long-term strategic growth brand, that it's going to find and amplify consumer trends. Some of the companies that have been able to do this well have already created those consumer trends themselves and based on some of the tailwinds that they've seen either in culture or something that they've been able to home grow themselves and build out fanfare around. And so if a company is telling me, yeah, we're just going to go out there and find it, it's not going to just fall on the doorstep.]"

The company’s market cap plunged by US$5.5b after price dropped by 3.5% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Kleber Santos, sold US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$40.81. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$114m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Wells Fargo Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Wells Fargo shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Wells Fargo insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

All DC businesses are eligible, with a special emphasis on businesses in Wards 5, 7, and 8-neighborhoods that have historically experienced economic discrimination. The Wells Fargo grant seeks to increase the number and type of small businesses from those areas eligible to raise capital through the DC Rebuild Bond Program on the SMBX marketplace.Many business owners are interested in the program, but need technical assistance to organize their finances and professionalize their bookkeeping before they can raise capital. Those small businesses will be identified by SMBX and referred to CNHED for that assistance, funded by the Wells Fargo grant.Technical assistance costs offset by the grant include:General accounting services, e.g. Quickbooks setup, etc.;Help establishing accounting best practices;Webinar education on business and financial planning;Incorporation legal services, e.g. from single member entity to LLC, etc.;Conversion from cash accounting, etc. to GAAP compliant accounting as required; and,Independent financial review for capital raises above certain thresholds.Once CNHED helps the businesses, they will be eligible to begin their capital raise campaigns on SMBX.""This Wells Fargo grant will ensure more small businesses, especially entrepreneurs of color, will have the resources they need to succeed through the DC Rebuild Bond Program and SMBX.

(NYSE:PFE) as an attractive investment with its 8.5x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Pfizer as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Pfizer will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Pfizer would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 140% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 138% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 14% per annum over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.6% growth each year, that's a disappointing outcome.In light of this, it's understandable that Pfizer's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. Even just maintaining these prices could be difficult to achieve as the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.What We Can Learn From Pfizer's P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Pfizer's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

We really should focus on those three groups who are most likely to benefit, because the goal of the vaccine is to protect against serious illness. It's the only reasonable goal, it's the only attainable goal,"" he said.The clinical results of the first COVID-19 vaccines in 2020 had surprised experts with strong protection against mild illness, but subsequent variants eroded that level of protection over time. However protection against severe illness and death remains strong — and that should remain the focal point, Offit said.He noted that some reports about his comments have misconstrued his claim to suggest that younger individuals shouldn't get the booster. He stressed instead that it's a matter of ""low risk, low reward.""""We're not going to be able to stop mild illness, we're not going to be able to stop transmission, and to try and do that with frequent boosters ... doesn't make a lot of sense,"" Offit said.That's because boosters only buy a few extra months of protection against mild illness before the antibodies wane, he said, and studies have shown that the vaccines do not necessarily prevent transmission.Story continuesHe added that epidemiologists and immunologists still need to figure out how long the original three doses protect against severe disease and death. Meanwhile, data is missing to support the fourth doses with the bivalent shots for all adults.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The clinical trial data for the bivalent boosters is still in the works as both Moderna (MRNA) and Pfizer (PFE)/ BioNTech (BNTX) run clinical trials. The FDA authorized the new doses based on extrapolating data from the BA.1 Omicron variant, assuming it translates to protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.But even the data for BA.1 was not ""clinically significant,"" Offit said, meaning that it was only a slight improvement over the original doses.""I would really like to see data showing that the bivalent vaccine is clearly and significantly better than the current monovalent vaccine,"" he said.And until a variant emerges that evades protection against severe illness, the vaccines should be considered effective. So far, the parts of the virus that our bodies have been trained by the vaccines to fight have stayed the same, which is why T-cell, or longer term, protection remains intact, Offit said.""For right now, the current vaccines work well,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

(PFE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pfizer-inc-130001953.html,1664370001,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +22.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +48%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.37 indicates a change of -17.9% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.13 billion and $81.26 billion estimates indicate +24.1% and -19.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $27.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +46.2%. EPS of $2.04 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.39%. The EPS surprise was +16.57%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Dillard's Inc. DDS, United Rentals Inc. URI and Unum Group UNM.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Value Stocks to Buy for Safety Amid Fed-Led Market RuckusSeptember is historically known as the toughest month on Wall Street. This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock's valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Dillard's Inc., United Rentals Inc. and Unum Group.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large  The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Story continuesInvestors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Avis Budget Group provides car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. The ability of CAR to cater to a wide range of mobility demands helps it to expand and strengthen its global foothold through organic growth.Avis Budget Group operates through distinct global brands that focus on different market segments and complement other brands in their respective regional markets. Fleet expansion and technology enhancement efforts by CAR are likely to enhance its offerings. The forward P/E of Avis Budget Group for the current financial year is 3.4X, lower than the industry average of 14.8X. CAR has a PEG ratio of 0.2, lower than the industry average of 1.3. Avis Budget Group has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.The forward P/E of Marathon Petroleum for the current financial year is 4.7X, lower than the industry average of 6.2X. MPC has a PEG ratio of 0.3, lower than the industry average of 0.5. Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last 7 days.United Rentals is benefiting from the U.S. administration's increased focus on infrastructural improvement. URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided United Rentals' second-quarter 2022 results. During the period, rental revenues grew 26.2% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin expanded 360 basis points.The forward P/E of United Rentals for the current financial year is 9.2X, lower than the industry average of 12X. URI has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 1.0. United Rentals has an expected earnings growth rate of 43.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 6.8% over the last 60 days.Unum Group's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. The sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistence levels in core business lines and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience.Continued rollout of dental products and geographic expansion have been paying off for UNM as its acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders' value. Unum Group expects 2022 premiums to grow about 2%. Adjusted operating EPS is expected to grow 15-20%.The forward P/E of Unum Group for the current financial year is 6.3X, lower than the industry average of 14.5X.

(NYSE: GM) and OneD Battery Sciences announced today the execution of a joint research development agreement focused on the potential use of OneD's silicon nanotechnology in GM's Ultium battery cells to drive significant increases in energy density for longer range and reduced cost. GM Ventures and Volta Energy Technologies also participated in OneD's Series C funding round, which the company recently closed at $25 million.The focus of the collaboration is OneD's SINANODE platform, which adds more silicon onto the anode battery cells by fusing silicon nanowires into EV-grade graphite. Silicon can store 10 times more energy than graphite. Increasing energy density can open the door to smaller, lighter, more efficient battery packs that could achieve higher driving range at lower cost.""GM designed Ultium to be a supremely flexible platform so we can continuously improve our cells as battery technology advances,"" said Kent Helfrich, GM chief technology officer, vice president of GM research and development, and president of GM Ventures. ""Our collaboration with OneD will focus on efforts to continue advancements in EV range, performance and cost.""The collaboration on silicon anode technology is believed to be the first of its kind between two American companies. GM is rapidly scaling its Ultium EV Platform to reach 1 million units of annual EV manufacturing capacity in North America by 2025. Earlier this year, GM's first Ultium Cells joint venture battery plant began production in Ohio, with two additional U.S. plants under construction and a fourth also planned.At the same time, GM is building on more than a decade of advanced battery research and development with its new Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan, which was completed earlier this year to help significantly ramp up development and production of next-generation Ultium batteries, along with production methods that can quickly be deployed at battery cell manufacturing plants.Story continuesFifteen years of OneD research and development has led to a portfolio of more than 240 granted patents. This enables OneD's business model to center on licensing the SINANODE technology to industrial partners and scale manufacturing faster and at a lower cost. Given a licensing business model and low operational costs, Series C funds will be used to continue SINANODE research and development, while advancing pilot production and providing OEMs and battery manufacturers a seamless integration into the manufacturing of EV batteries via licensed manufacturing partners.""From day one, OneD has aimed to simplify silicon as the means to a completely new era of EVs. We believe that the winners of the EV race will be those who can effectively add more silicon to the battery cell, in a way that doesn't disrupt existing supply chains and processes,"" said Vincent Pluvinage, CEO, OneD Battery Sciences. ""We're thrilled to collaborate with General Motors on our shared goal of accelerating mass EV adoption.""About OneD Battery SciencesOneD Battery Sciences is the creator of SINANODE, the breakthrough technology that successfully adds more energy-dense silicon into the anodes of EV batteries. The company operates a SINANODE pilot production program to support the development of advanced electrochemical cells and the production scale-up of its industrial partners. In 2013, OneD Battery Sciences acquired Nanosys' nanowire technologies (SINANODE) and its Palo Alto R&amp;D activities. Today, the Palo Alto-based company has over 240 granted patents and applications in large scale anode production and innovative EV battery designs.About General MotorsGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a global company focused on advancing an all-electric future that is inclusive and accessible to all.

The White House is reportedly preparing for a possible departure of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. According to Axios, this would likely be part of a broader reshuffling of Biden's economic team after the midterms. Officials are also weighing the possibility that National Economic Council director Brian Deese will leave early next year.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, White House officials tell us they are planning for potential transitions post-midterms, but neither Deese nor Yellen are part of those plans. They did confirm to us that Chair Cecilia Rouse will return to Princeton University in 2023, the end of her two-year public service leave. And we just talked to a former head of the Council of Economic Advisors, Austan Goolsbee. He said for folks to leave at this juncture would not be unusual.The Senate averted a government shutdown Tuesday by passing a stopgap bill extending government funding until December 16. But the bill still has to face one final vote in the Senate before moving to the House. Included in that bill is $12 billion in military aid to Ukraine. What it does not include its sped up permitting of energy projects. That was a proposal by Senator Joe Manchin that drew criticism from both sides of the aisle. Manchin eventually conceded, and that measure was left out.And General Motors is clarifying its return to office plans after backlash from employees. An internal message sent Friday said corporate workers must return to office location at least three days a week, starting later this year. It's a departure from CEO Mary Barra's flexible work appropriately plan that rolled out last April. In a follow-up note, General Motors ensured employees the three days would not be mandated. It could be decided by individual teams. It also clarified that nobody would be required to return until the first quarter of next year.]"

PNC closed the buyout of Linga, a point of sale (POS) and payment solutions firm. The latter provides a pre-eminent cloud-based restaurant operating system. Thus, it will expand PNC Financial’s ability to cater to the hospitality and restaurant industry clients.The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Linga was founded in 2004 and has developed its proprietary restaurant operating system Linga rOS®. This was the first all-in-one, cloud-based operating system introduced to the marketplace. The same currently serves clients in 48 countries.Linga’s operating system has additional features, including online ordering, payments, QR code-based menus and virtual kiosks. The acquisition will enable PNC Financial to leverage the operating system, as it will be integrated into the bank's digital solutions ecosystem and expand its digital resources.Per management, ""This acquisition reflects our continued commitment to expanding our corporate payments capabilities, as well as investing in the solutions and tools our clients need to run their businesses more effectively.""Management also noted, ""Leveraging Linga's proprietary solutions and PNC's competitive treasury management platform, we will be able to provide our restaurant and retail clients with the tools they need to keep up with ever-changing consumer expectations.""PNC Financial remains committed to strengthening its business through strategic initiatives. In October 2021, the company completed the conversion of BBVA USA customers and employees to PNC Financial's network and platforms.

It plans to extend the reach of its middle-market corporate banking franchise into new markets and expand its retail banking brand nationally. Thus, its bottom line is likely to get further support if it continues to make planned investments and diversify its business mix.Story continuesWith the pandemic accelerating the demand for contactless experiences such as online ordering and QR codes, PNC Financial’s acquisition of Linga will likely prove fruitful.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have declined 23.7%, narrower than the industry’s fall of 24.8% over the past six months.

That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$148).

PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$208m based on the recent share price.

So great to have you on the show here. So for people who are wondering, perhaps, they want to invest in some of this new technology, talk about some of the holdings in this ETF and how investors can get in on this.LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, so Robo Global, the company, built Robo, our robotics and automation ETF, almost a decade ago. So we're investing across the entire ecosystem of robotics and automation, so really looking at automation as a megatrend. About half the portfolio, actually about 60%, is in areas where we can apply these robotics technologies. And about 40% is the technology, the sensing and computing actuation, AI, and integration-- the technology underneath the robots.So we believe that you should really own the whole ecosystem of automation because while automation is relentless, it's not perhaps moving sector by sector in lockstep. So sometimes you're catching really great growth, really great opportunities. Right now, logistics automation, you want to talk Amazon. Logistics automation is something we're also excited about. And you want to also own the companies in 3D printing that maybe are not so much seeing the fad like they were maybe five years ago, but are an integral part of the automation ecosystem.SEANA SMITH: Lauren, there certainly are so many players in this space, even more companies jumping in, it seems, like on a daily basis when it comes to automation. How are you picking out the winner since it is such a broad spectrum?LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, yeah, so we look at the 11 subsectors that we really think make up the automation ecosystem. And we look for market leaders in those sectors, for technology leaders in those sectors. So we want to really populate the entire spectrum with leaders. We want to talk about-- let's talk about warehouse automation. 20% of the warehouses in the United States are only using some amount of automation today.Story continuesSo we look at a company that's going to be able to really penetrate that market and provide solutions there. We want to talk about logistics automation. We're going to talk about companies like-- Machine Vision is going to be a key part of that, so Cognex and Keyence from Japan and Samsara. Ultimately, we don't care where a company is located. We just care that they're leaders in some component of the automation megatrend.DAVE BRIGGS: Pre-pandemic automation was viewed as really a threat to jobs not just here, but around the world. But how is the employment shortage in just about every field imaginable actually contributing to the growth of some of these companies?LAUREN HEIN: Yeah, I think McKinsey said that there were-- 88% of the companies that they surveyed last year said that they're going to employ some sort of automation technology. The obvious places to think are going to be manufacturing and some sort of warehouse. I mean, gosh, Amazon's attrition rate last year was like 160%. So you've got to start thinking that robots can do some of these jobs.Obviously, with wage inflation, automation is going to solve that problem to some extent, make the investment in robots, and then you've got some sort of cost control there, as opposed to the variability of labor. But there are-- robots are not going to replace people everywhere. Cobots is also a major industry, and cobots are going to work alongside people, just things that we can't do with just the machine.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Lauren, I want to ask you about supply chain challenges. Obviously, not just for things like the chips that go into this technology, but even the materials, some of these commodities that we see that are required that are needed for growth in some of these industries. What are you watching in that space? And how concerned are you that some of these supply chain issues still haven't been resolved yet?LAUREN HEIN: So the supply chain issues are especially hairy for some of the companies in the manufacturing or capital goods side of the robo ETF companies like FANUC, Daifuku, Kardex even. Like, these companies are trying to meet the demand for robots and robotics, but they're just having issues getting not just semiconductors, but they're also having trouble getting component parts like sensors and other types of actuators.It's just been an ongoing issue. They're not able to meet the demand for this-- for the orders that they have right now. So you're actually having sales growth continue to climb. But these companies in the robotics manufacturing space just not being able to meet their current orders.So it's ongoing. You will see some reshoring, obviously, here in the US. We're really leaning into manufacturing our own chips and the semiconductor fabs that were estimating to build, I think, 10 over the next two years as part of the Chips Act that we passed this summer. So, yes, the supply chain is an ongoing concern. But it's going to take a few years to resolve.]"

The stock has declined 14.1% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for CSXThe RSI reading of 21.99 for CSX is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for CSXThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for CSX has increased 0.1%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, CSX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

The bank will also pay a $50 million fine.The bank did not admit or deny the CFPB's findings. In a statement, the bank said it was pleased to resolve the matter, and had stopped charging that fee over a year ago.The CFPB said regulators have long discouraged banks from charging so-called ""authorized positive"" fees, which are fees a bank charges when a customer has enough funds at the time of a transaction, but ends up overdrawing their account when the transaction clears the following day due to other activity.The agency said the bank could have scrapped the fee earlier, but while building an alternate fee structure, it kept in place ""unintelligible and manipulative processes"" that made it difficult for customers to know if they had enough funds to cover transactions. The CFPB order bans the bank from charging the fee going forward.""Regions Bank raked in tens of millions of dollars in surprise overdraft fees every year, even after its own staff warned that the bank's practices were illegal,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in the statement.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220928005703/en/Regions Bank’s corporate headquarters in Birmingham, Ala. (Photo: Business Wire)As part of the settlement, Regions will pay a $50 million civil monetary penalty and provide customer redress of approximately $141 million; the financial impact of the settlement will be reflected in the company’s results for the third quarter of 2022.Although Regions Bank disagrees with the CFPB’s characterizations, the bank cooperated with the investigation and is pleased to move forward. Agreeing to the settlement reflects Regions’ desire to focus its attention on continuing to support customers through a wide range of account enhancements that have already lowered fees for many customers. With more work planned, Regions will continue to build on these customer-focused enhancements.In 2019, Regions began developing a series of changes to its overdraft process that ultimately led to reduced fees and benefited consumers, including through the elimination of the type of overdraft fee that is addressed in the CFPB settlement. The fee addressed in the settlement impacted a small percentage of customers. The broader series of enhancements made by Regions were designed to support the bank’s broad customer base. Further, the changes resulted in declines of fee-related revenue. The changes Regions made also included features designed to give customers more tools for managing their daily cash flow and avoiding various types of fees.Story continuesRegions Bank Chief Legal Officer Tara Plimpton commented on the settlement with the CFPB, along with steps the bank has taken in recent years to further enhance its services:""Regions Bank has always been committed to delivering financial services our customers need, want, choose, and value, and our commitment remains strong. We are pleased to resolve this matter and look forward to building further on our commitment to help customers reach their financial goals,"" Plimpton said.""The CFPB settlement involves one type of overdraft fee that was previously charged when there was sufficient money in an account when a debit card or ATM transaction was authorized – but not when the transaction actually posted to the account, due to other transactions,"" Plimpton explained. ""Over a year ago, Regions stopped charging this particular overdraft fee. We took this action as part of a broader series of enhancements. These enhancements also include updating the bank’s posting order and transaction processing to give customers a clearer view of the money they have available for making purchases while avoiding fees. Regions took additional steps this year to even further reduce overdraft charges while eliminating other fees.""Plimpton added, ""Helping our customers build financial wellness is a top priority for Regions Bank. That is demonstrated through our enhanced services as well as our year-round commitment to providing free financial education and customized financial plans for consumers.""Additional Details:Regions’ commitment to customers includes a series of steps taken in recent years to help customers build their savings, successfully manage their finances, and avoid various fees. Among examples:In early 2022, Regions announced several customer-focused changes, including:The elimination of overdraft protection transfer fees.The elimination of non-sufficient funds fees.A further reduction in the bank’s caps on overdraft fees.The launch of an early direct deposit feature making consumers’ paychecks available up to two days early.The launch of a low-cost line of credit to help cover short-term financial needs.These changes were implemented during the first three quarters of 2022 and are now all in effect.Earlier, Regions unveiled a series of posting order and processing enhancements that took effect in 2021. These changes are detailed at this link and included moving to more of a real-time order for processing debits, payments, transfers, and withdrawals. This gives customers a more current view of the money they have available for covering purchases or payments – or adding to their long-term savings.Regions also updated its CheckCard transaction processing and previously changed how checks are processed on personal accounts to show pending transactions sooner.In addition, Regions improved account alerts to make it easier for customers to be aware of transactions and balances. Customers can set customized alerts, such as deposit and withdrawal alerts, to keep up with their transactions and balances.Building Financial Wellness:Beyond account enhancements, the bank offers Regions Next Step®, a robust, year-round program that connects people with free financial education. This extends beyond in-person discussions and includes a consistently updated online library of financial wellness materials for a variety of age groups. The materials are available to anyone, regardless of whether they bank with Regions. Consider these financial wellness results from 2021 alone:Company-wide, Regions Next Step supported 124,000 financial wellness workshops covering a variety of topics.Approximately 1.4 million people received financial education from Regions.There were 2.4 million page views of Regions’ digital financial education resources.Financial wellness is also a key component of Regions’ Community Engagement strategy. In cities large and small, Regions and its community partners are taking clear action to help people grow their savings, improve their credit scores, achieve homeownership, strengthen their small businesses, and more.An Ongoing Focus:Given the importance of financial wellness to Regions Bank and the communities served by the company, Regions will continue to explore a variety of avenues toward reaching consumers and businesses with effective services, insights, and solutions that help them reach their goals. This is reflected in how Regions’ bankers meet with clients one-on-one to develop customized financial roadmaps toward success. It is reflected in Regions’ work with nonprofits and community partners.

The bank will also pay a $50 million fine.The bank did not admit or deny the CFPB's findings. In a statement, the bank said it was pleased to resolve the matter, and had stopped charging that fee over a year ago.The CFPB said regulators have long discouraged banks from charging so-called ""authorized positive"" fees, which are fees a bank charges when a customer has enough funds at the time of a transaction, but ends up overdrawing their account when the transaction clears the following day due to other activity.The agency said the bank could have scrapped the fee earlier, but while building an alternate fee structure, it kept in place ""unintelligible and manipulative processes"" that made it difficult for customers to know if they had enough funds to cover transactions. The CFPB order bans the bank from charging the fee going forward.""Regions Bank raked in tens of millions of dollars in surprise overdraft fees every year, even after its own staff warned that the bank's practices were illegal,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in the statement. ""Too often, large financial firms make a calculation that continuing to break the law is more profitable than following it."" (Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Paul Simao and Chris Reese)]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Are Holding Up in the Bear MarketThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Index has slipped into the bear market. Following yesterday's decline of 1.1%, the index is now down 20.5% from its Jan 4 peak (hence meeting the definition of a bear market).Worries that the Federal Reserve's aggressive stance to fight decade-high inflation will push the U.S. economy into a downturn have weighed on investor sentiments since the beginning of 2022. This has sent the domestic equity markets tumbling after a solid performance last year.The Dow, the 30-stock blue-chip index, rallied almost 19% in 2021. But macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have led to a pessimistic stance since the start of this year. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa and American Express – that are part of the index.So far this year, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP have plunged 32.6%, 23%, 16.7% and 16%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in quality franchises.While the central bank's efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the coming six-nine months remain a big headwind. Until now, consumer confidence and spending are holding up well, but with the steady rate increase, these are likely to witness weakness.Hence, investors are shying away from stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Story continuesLet's now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM's balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The company has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of the competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, which will strengthen its operations through technological advancement.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM's deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2022, total loans grew 6% year over year to $1.1 trillion.While higher rates and the expected global economic slowdown will continue hampering investment banking (IB) business, JPMorgan's leading position in garnering global IB fees will offer leverage. Also, ongoing macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions should keep the markets volatile in the quarters ahead, helping the company earn measurable trading revenues (which account for almost 25% of its total net revenues).Also, JPM currently pays investors $4.00 per share as an annual dividend, which yields 3.66%. The company increased its dividend four times in the past five years, and its payout grew 14.82% over the same time period. JPM's payout ratio is 32% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past week.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses, while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In April 2022, this Zacks Rank #3 company acquired Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, while in March, it closed the acquisition of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, it completed the purchase of Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Further, its asset management division has announced a deal to acquire robo-advisor NextCapital.The company's IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first half of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman's solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Backed by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders' value. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share in July. Prior to this, it announced a dividend hike by 60% to $2 per share last year.Based on the dividend paid out over the trailing four quarters, GS has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In the last five years, the company has increased its dividend five times, with an annualized growth rate of 25.7%. Further, the company's payout ratio is 18% of earnings.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 8.66, which is lower than the industry average of 12.45. Also, its P/B ratio of 0.96 is below the industry average of 1.54.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay, and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.V enjoys compelling cash and available-for-sale investment position along with a healthy free cash flow, which enables it to make acquisitions and fund capital expenditure. Backed by its strong cash position, it remains committed to boosting shareholders' value. Visa has increased its dividend each year since 2009, with the latest being a 17% hike in October 2021 to 37.5 cents per share. The stock has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 16.6%. Further, the payout ratio of V is 21% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has moved marginally upward, while that for 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top line in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #2 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that American Express is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company also forms strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It recently announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The company has robust cash-generating abilities in place through which business investment and prudent shareholder-friendly moves are undertaken. This March, the company announced a hike of around 20% in the quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share. The company has a dividend yield of 1.48% and five-year annualized dividend growth of 7.2%. Further, AXP's payout ratio is 21% of earnings at present.Also, American Express currently has a Value Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

While yearly listing price growth remained in the double-digits in September (+13.9%), the pace continued to moderate, suggesting that a rise in relatively affordable for-sale homes could be in store for buyers in the final months of 2022.""Home prices have been remarkably resilient so far this year, considering the impact that inflation and climbing rates are having on buyers' budgets. Recent data does show some deceleration in listing prices, and a seasonal pull back that is typical of this time of year. On the flip side, this cooling is likely one reason why fewer sellers entered the market in September,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""For homeowners deciding whether to make a move this year, remember that listing prices – while lower than a few months ago – remain higher than in prior years, so you're still likely to find opportunities to cash-in on record-high levels of equity, particularly if you've owned your home for a longer period of time. And for prospective buyers grappling with affordability, you may have more bargaining power than you realize, particularly in areas where time on market is rising.""September 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Sept. 2021Change over Sept. 2019 Median listing price13.9% (to $427,000)36.7 %Active listings26.9 %-40.2 %New listings-9.8 %-11.6 %Median days on market7 days (to 50 days)-16 days Inventory improvements hold steady even as new sellers hit pauseThe U.S. supply of active listings remained higher than last year in September, but improvements failed to accelerate over last month as newly listed homes continued to drop. With higher rates resulting in less demand and fewer home sales, seller sentiment continues to decline and impact homeowner plans to list. Still, today's buyers have significantly more options than during the worst of the inventory crunch of the previous two years. This is especially true in many southern and western markets, where competition has cooled compared to the COVID frenzy.Story continuesNationally, the inventory of homes actively for sale on a typical day in September increased 26.9% (+155,000) year-over-year, holding on par with the August pace (+26.9%). Newly-listed homes were down 9.8% year-over-year, a slight improvement over last month's rate of decline (-13.0%).Compared to last year, inventory increased in 36 out of 50 of the largest metros, led by markets in the West (+64.2%) and South (+57.5%): Phoenix (+167.3%), Raleigh, N.C. (+166.1) and Nashville, Tenn. (+125.3%).In September, active listings dropped year-over-year in just one region, the Northeast (-6.0%). New listings declined from September 2021 levels in all four regions, led by the Northeast (-17.2%) and followed by the Midwest (-14.0%), West (-12.2%) and South (-3.9%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, just eight saw the number of new sellers increase over September 2021 levels: New Orleans (+119.3% as last year was impacted by Hurricane Ida), Nashville. (+19.6%), Tampa, Fla. (+9.2%), Dallas (+9.1%), Birmingham, Ala. (+6.1%), Houston (+3.6%), San Antonio (+2.9%) and Raleigh (+2.0%).Home price growth continues to moderate but remains in the double-digitsIn September, national home listing prices increased at a faster September pace than in any prior year in our data's history, despite continuing to moderate from June's peak growth rate. Driven by the combination of still-high listing prices and climbing mortgage rates, a typical monthly mortgage payment was 70% higher in September compared to a year ago. As a result of these cost pressures, recent home sales data indicates that some home shoppers are putting plans on pause, giving those who remained in the market more power to negotiate price reductions in September.The U.S. median listing price was $427,000, up 13.9% year-over-year. However, listing prices declined from June's peak median ($449,000) and annual growth rate (+18.2%).Nationally, the share of homes having their price reduced grew to 19.5% from 11.0% last September, and also climbed higher than typical 2017 and 2019 levels (18.7%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, southern and midwestern markets (+11.8%, on average) led the charge in yearly listing price growth in September, with the biggest increases registered in Miami (+28.3%), Memphis, Tenn. (+27.3%), and Milwaukee (+27.0%). Listing prices declined in just two markets: New Orleans (-2.3%) and Pittsburgh (-0.8%).Western metros posted the biggest gains in the share of listings with price reductions, led by Phoenix (+32.3 percentage points), Austin, Texas (+27.4 percentage points) and Las Vegas(+20.0 percentage points).Time on market remains higher than last year but is still historically-fast In September, a typical home spent more days on market than last year, after first hitting that milestone just last month. As inventory continues to rise this fall compared to last year, homebuyers have relatively more breathing room to make decisions. This was true of September time on market trends nationwide, as well as in all four regions and in the vast majority of U.S. metros. However, compared to historical norms in prior years, homes continue to sell at a faster pace so far in 2022.The typical U.S. home spent 50 days on the market in September, up seven days year-over-year compared to an annual increase of four days in August, which marked the first increase since the early days of COVID. Nonetheless, time on market was still 18 days faster than the typical September 2017-2019 pace.Homes spent longer on the market than last year across regions: The West, up 10 days; the South, up six days; the Northeast, up five days; and the Midwest, up five days.Relative to the national pace, time on market slowed similarly across the 50 largest U.S. metros, on average, up seven days year-over-year to a median of 43 days. Among these markets, the biggest yearly time on market increases were in Austin (+23 days), Raleigh (+23 days), Phoenix (+17 days) and Las Vegas (+17 days).In September, homes sold more quickly than last year in just five metros: New Orleans (-9 days, again reflecting the impact of Hurricane Ida last year), Richmond, Va.

247,064aa2d9-47f9-3fda-9dee-9c2fc4edb149,SNA,2022-09-29,Snap-On (SNA) Could Be a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-sna-could-great-choice-154503083.html,1664379903,STORY,['SNA'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of -5.14% since the start of the year. The tool and diagnostic equipment maker is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.78%. This compares to the Tools - Handheld industry's yield of 0.7% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.85%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.68 is up 11.2% from last year. Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 14.71%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 36%, which means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, SNA expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $16.14 per share, with earnings expected to increase 8.18% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, SNA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Through a joint research study with Kindness.org, these initial insights reveal the most effective, appreciated and most cost-effective ways that neighbors can spread kindness in their communities - defined as acts that have the highest perceived benefits relative to the personal cost of performing them. The full results of this study will be released later this fall.Conducted through a survey of over 5,000 participants in August 2022, this initial exploration studied the perceived kindness of a collection of 385 acts, but also their perceived cost to the actor in terms of time, effort, expense and the overall benefit to the recipient. This approach enabled a further calculation of each act’s cost-benefit ratio, or overall ‘cost-effectiveness’. To inspire participation in National Neighbor Day, the following insights reveal the overall ‘Kindest Acts’ one can plan for their neighbors:Top 10 Overall Kindest Acts for NeighborsPay for a neighbor’s groceries at the supermarketDonate money to a neighborDonate diapers to a neighborBuy extra school supplies for a neighborRemind a neighbor that they matter Accept a neighbor as they areOrganize or join local park and beach clean upsTell a neighbor what a positive difference they made to someone else’s lifeMow the lawn for a neighborSurprise a neighbor with their favorite thingsDelving further into the perceived balance of cost, benefit and impact, the research also defined the most-effective acts of kindness for neighbors, revealing the high value of gestures that come from the heart rather than the wallet.Story continuesTop 10 Most Cost-effective Kind Acts to Do For NeighborsCompliment a neighborRemind a neighbor that they matterAccept a neighbor as they areTell a neighbor what a positive difference they made to someone else’s life Donate items they no longer need or useWrite a list of lovely things about a neighborArrive at meetings with a neighbor on time Pray for a neighborReturn a borrowed book to a neighborBring attention to the accomplishments of a neighbor“We all have the capacity for kindness – but we don’t always act on it,” said Krista Bourne, chief operating officer of Verizon Consumer Group. “We hope the results of this research will showcase just how easy and cost effective it is to be kind - and for people to take action. Whether you are at the store, at work or in your neighborhood, we can all use a little more kindness.”“As communities are navigating inflation and economic challenges these findings are a clear reminder that simple acts of kindness come at little cost, and are a powerful way to strengthen our neighborhoods,” said Sarah Friar, Chief Executive Officer, Nextdoor. “Offering a thoughtful word or simply reaching out to your neighbor builds important connections in our communities so that everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.”“Kindness is a great way to kickstart cooperative relationships with neighbors. We hope these recommended acts of kindness will help make everyone’s community a kinder place to be,” said Dr Oliver Scott Curry, Chief Science Officer for kindness.org.Verizon’s #ACallForKindness campaign inspires kind acts through a multifaceted approach that leverages research, inspires people through art, educates people through kindness experts, and provides opportunities for people to quickly and easily choose kindness, no matter who they are or where they live. Visit verizon.com/kindness to take the kindness pledge and learn how you can choose kindness today.Today’s Neighbor Day insights come at the end of a month-long initiative: The Big Neighborhood MeetUp. Throughout September, Nextdoor and Verizon hosted free all-age events in neighborhoods in Chicago, Houston, Raleigh and Oakland for an afternoon of fun, food, games, and reconnecting with their community. These inspired tens of thousands of people nationwide to join the ‘MeetUp’ movement by creating their own events and activities within their own neighborhoods. From simple coffee dates to full-fledged festivals, these home-grown MeetUps showcased the flavor and personality of their communities, including backyard BBQs, outdoor concerts, sports viewing parties, game nights, community garage sales and many more. Additionally, the two companies will bring a fifth #BigNeighborhoodMeetUp to New York’s Advertising Week, with a panel discussion on October 19th diving deeper into these insights and the impact of kind acts on building stronger, more connected communities.

Highlights from the preliminary proxy filing include:Aimco has undergone a comprehensive transformation following the December 2020 spin-off of Apartment Income REIT Corp (""AIR"")Aimco’s new post-spin majority-independent and reconstituted Board of Directors (the ""New Aimco Board"") was appointed following the closing of the December 2020 spin-off of AIR, whereby two-thirds of the pre-spin-off Board resigned and was replaced following a thorough search process assisted by a leading executive and board search firm.Aimco has appointed six of its eight independent directors within the past 21 months, adding a fresh perspective with relevant skills in the areas of real estate finance, capital markets, development and transactions, business operations and board leadership, while retaining three directors with complementary skillsets and important historical knowledge of Aimco’s business operations.Aimco also appointed an all-new executive management team following the spin-off, comprising experienced real estate executives with fresh perspectives as well as a deep understanding of the industry, Aimco and its assets.Aimco developed and communicated a new strategy for growth, focused on value-add, opportunistic and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.The New Aimco Board and leadership team have delivered significant stockholder value during their short tenureSince the December 2020 spin-off, when the New Aimco Board and all new management team assumed their current roles, Aimco has delivered total stockholder returns of 56%1, significantly outperforming its identified developer peer group, the FTSE Nareit Equity Apartment Index, the MSCI US REIT Index, the S&amp;P 500, and the Russell 2000. The Company has made significant progress over that period across all aspects of its stated growth strategy. Specific accomplishments include:Story continuesCreating $100 million of value from the monetization of successfully executed development and redevelopment projects;Securing significant, high-quality, future development opportunities, more than tripling Aimco's controlled pipeline to a total potential of more than 15 million square feet, located in high-growth markets;Retiring or refinancing more than $1 billion of near-term liabilities, eliminating substantially all of its floating rate exposure;Entering into a strategic capital partnership with Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation providing core equity capital for up to $1 billion of Aimco-led multifamily development projects and creating the opportunity to earn third-party management fees and incentive income;Unlocking $265 million of asset value by selling three stabilized multifamily assets at prices above the values in Aimco’s internal Net Asset Value estimate and by selling a partial interest in our passive minority investment in the life science developer, IQHQ, generating a greater than 50% internal rate of return;Eliminating various legacy entanglements with AIR through the early repayment of the $534 million purchase money note, the reduction of leasehold liabilities from $475.1 million down to $6.1 million, and the amendment of key provisions of the master leasing agreement with AIR;Acquiring approximately 742,164 Aimco shares at a weighted average price of $5.93 per share and increasing the Company’s share repurchase authorization from 10 million to 15 million shares; andBuilding and maintaining a highly qualified and dedicated team of real estate investment professionals, achieving an all-time Company record employee engagement score of 4.52, out of 5, based on independent third-party surveys.Notwithstanding Aimco’s superior results and the appointment of the New Aimco Board, Aimco stockholder Land &amp; Buildings has provided a notice of competing director nominationsIn the preliminary proxy statement filed today, Aimco disclosed that Land &amp; Buildings Investment Management, LLC submitted to the Company a notice of nomination of three alternative candidates to stand for election to the Aimco Board of Directors. Aimco is committed to regular engagement with stockholders, and has held more than 80 individual meetings with more than 35 current and prospective stockholders in the past 13 months, including stockholders representing more than 80% in the aggregate of Aimco’s outstanding shares of common stock. Following several discussions with Land &amp; Buildings, evaluation of its perspectives and review of its candidates, the New Aimco Board and management strongly believe that Aimco’s three director nominees are best positioned to continue overseeing Aimco’s growth. While the New Aimco Board and management are open to continued dialogue with Land &amp; Buildings, they believe that the alternative candidates are unlikely to bring any expertise or perspectives that are not already well represented in the Aimco boardroom and could disrupt the considerable momentum that the Company has built over the past 21 months.The New Aimco Board is comprised of highly skilled, diverse and dedicated directors who have deep experience and a diversity of viewpoints and are unwavering in their commitment to enhance value for all stockholders.________________________1 TSR calculation as of September 23, 2022About AimcoAimco is a diversified real estate company primarily focused on value add, opportunistic, and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.

And part of that is acknowledging that it needs to deliver on its promises to once again stand as the most advanced semiconductor company on Earth.The chip giant laid out the latest steps in its turnaround plan at its Intel Innovation conference in San Jose, California, this week, unveiling its 13th-generation Intel Core processors, and announcing that its top tier desktop graphics card, the Arc A770, will cost just $329. That lines up with Nvidia’s (NVDA) RTX 3060 cards, which cost between $400 and $450.But showing off new chips and hardware isn’t enough, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, told Yahoo Finance. And it will take time to win back the trust consumers and business customers had in the company before AMD surpassed Intel in the performance and price departments.“We've got to deliver our cadence of products on a yearly drumbeat that is unquestioned…we’ve got to build back that customer trust,” Holthaus said.She added: “I think [Intel’s 12th-gen chip] was a good step. [the 13th-gen chip], there's another good step. But it's going take us a few years of doing that continually for people just to be like, ‘Okay, that drumbeat of performance, and execution is back.’ And we're laser focused on that.”After running roughshod on AMD (AMD) for years, Intel took a backseat to the smaller CPU maker in 2020 in terms of performance with its Ryzen chips. While Intel largely clawed back the crown with its 12th-generation chips in 2021, the damage was done.What’s more, AMD started capturing market share from Intel in the server space. And in July, AMD’s market cap surpassed Intel’s. While Intel’s market cap is now larger at $110.9 billion, it’s not much higher than AMD’s $109.9 billion.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger arrives on stage to speak during a groundbreaking for a new Intel computer chip facility in New Albany, Ohio, Friday, Sep. 9, 2022. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)It didn’t help that Apple ditched Intel to make its own chips, claiming that Intel was holding it back. And while the company didn’t account for a huge amount of Intel’s sales, the loss served as a symbolic strike against the chip maker.Story continuesWith its 13th-generation processors, mobile and desktop graphics processors, and renewed dedication to its developer community, though, Intel is in position to impress both consumers and its production partners, according to Holthaus.Unfortunately, Intel’s turnaround plans come at a time when inflation is running wild, interest rates are on the rise, and consumer demand, especially for PCs, is plummeting. To contend with the economic storm, Holthaus says Intel will look toward commercial customers.“I'm pretty steadfast in my belief that it is beneficial for companies to make sure that their employees, particularly in a hybrid environment, have the right PC device that allows them the access and capabilities that they need,” she explained. “With our next generation of parts, there are going to be a lot more AI capabilities that are going to make that hybrid environment better and better.”Consumer customers, Holthaus said, will be trickier than businesses, because many purchased new PCs over the past two years as millions remained indoors during the pandemic.Still, Intel has seen the number of people using its PCs increase since the start of the pandemic and is holding steady. That means consumers aren’t going back to relying on their smartphones as their primary productivity devices — at least not yet.As for those consumers who haven’t updated their computers, Holthaus says Intel needs to convince those users that now is the time to step up to a new machine.“There's hundreds and millions of units out there to be refreshed, and it's our job to explain to them why and why they want to do it on an Intel machine,” she said. “And I think graphics can play a role there. Obviously, integrated graphics, we have significant market segment share. But imagine a world in a couple of years where you can get the best of our integrated graphics and our discrete graphics.”Of course, Intel losing Apple is still a sore spot for the company. And each time Apple rolls out a new chip, it makes sure to point out that its silicon is more power efficient than Intel’s — something that’s incredibly important when it comes to laptops.Despite Apple’s lead, Holthaus says that Intel isn’t giving up on making Apple a customer again. And while the chances of that are slim, if it can continue to improve on its designs, it might make the iPhone maker regret ditching its former partner.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanTech’s ugly quarter will bleed into OctoberIntel is looking to developers to help power its turnaroundMeta is desperate to fight back against Apple’s privacy changesGot a tip?

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Sept. 28, 2022Tech's ugly summer will get worse before it gets betterThe third quarter will, mercifully, come to an end Friday, closing out a trainwreck for big names in the tech industry as fears of a recession, changing consumer appetites, a broader bear market, and supply chain snarls conspired against the once-hot sector.Shares of Big Tech companies have collapsed. Year-to-date Meta (META) is down 59%, while Nvidia is down 58%. Amazon (AMZN) is off 31%, same as Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) is down 29%. The only firms outpacing the broader S&amp;P 500 — which is off 22% — are Tesla (TSLA), which is down 21%, and Apple, down 15%.“It’s the most negative as I’ve seen tech going back to 2009,” Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Monday, noting that investors are shying away from riskier investments like tech.But long-term tech investors shouldn’t lose hope, especially if consumer demand for products like Apple’s iPhones and cloud computing orders for companies like Microsoft hold pace. And while we could see ugly earnings reports in October, tech companies could start to bounce back by the new year.Tough going for everyone but Apple and TeslaHow did we get here? While life has returned to normal for most people, the shocks the pandemic sent through the economy continue to reverberate with some of the highest inflation we’ve seen in decades.The Federal Reserve is responding by driving interest rates ever higher. In turn, a strengthening dollar is also hurting companies’ sales abroad, with many firms reporting foreign exchange rates as a major pain point in their last earnings reports. These macroeconomic factors took a particular toll on tech companies specializing in discretionary items as consumers pulled back from making purchases.Story continuesTo say it was a difficult quarter for tech companies is an understatement. And while they’re all getting hit by inflation and rising interest rates, it’s showing through in different ways.Nvidia has seen sales of its graphics cards drop, as PC sales falter. (Photo via Getty Images)Chip companies, for instance, saw demand for semiconductors fall amid declines in PC sales. Ahead of its second quarter earnings, Nvidia (NVDA) announced it would miss its prior projections as gaming sales dried up. According to the company's numbers, gaming segment revenue dropped an eye-watering 33% year-over-year in the quarter and 44% compared to the first quarter. Worse still, Nvidia missed street expectations for its third-quarter forecast, saying it will bring in $5.9 billion rather than the $6.9 billion analysts had expected.Intel took a similar hit as PC sales fell, and Microsoft reported that its Windows OEM revenue, the money it brings in from sales of Windows to PC makers, fell 2% year over year. Intel (INTC), meanwhile, took a hit thanks to a decline in PC and server chips. The company is projecting 2022 year-end revenue will be $11 billion lower than it initially expected.Meanwhile, ad-supported tech companies like Meta and Snap (SNAP) have been hurt by Apple’s (AAPL) privacy changes that prevent apps from tracking their users’ activity across the web. That and slowing ad sales amid the current economic climate, resulted in Meta’s first ever year-over-year revenue decline, dropping by 1%. Snap hasn’t done much better, announcing layoffs and cuts to products like its drone camera.Amazon, for its part, is trying to correct itself after over-expanding its e-commerce division to deal with the crush of orders during the height of the pandemic. And while it beat on revenue expectations in the second quarter, and surpassed third-quarter projections, there’s no telling how a slowing economy could impact overall sales.Some companies, however, have continued to perform surprisingly well. Not only did Apple beat analysts’ expectations on revenue and earnings in the second quarter, but it also set a quarterly revenue record as well. Tesla, meanwhile, met revised expectations for the quarter, and announced that June was its highest vehicle production month yet.It’s not all doom and gloomThere are other bright spots in tech, chiefly in the cloud space. While Microsoft’s Windows OEM division was slapped in the quarter, its cloud business did incredibly well. The company missed analysts’ expectations on overall revenue, but its Intelligent Cloud revenue was up 40% year over year. Nvidia, meanwhile, saw its Data Center business revenue jump 61% in the quarter.Apple CEO Tim Cook welcomes customers outside the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)“Fundamentally, enterprise tech has held up well, as budgets and spending are not tapering off given the massive spending allocated to cloud and digital transformation projects,” said Ives. “That said, the softer economy is now front and center and we would expect [foreign exchange] and macro headwinds to be a key theme during tech earnings season in October. The stocks are reflecting a lot of bad news and the Street will breathe a sigh of relief if demand holds through the rest of the year in the beaten-down tech sector.”Demand for Apple’s new iPhone 14 line is also holding steady compared to the iPhone 13, and with the Pro devices getting the biggest push, that could bode well for sales in the coming quarters.Companies are also committed to investments despite the economic downturn. During Intel’s Innovation conference on Tuesday, CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company is continuing to move forward with its plans to build out chip foundries and is dedicated to its move into the graphics chip market.The coming holiday season will be an incredibly important time for the industry as analysts and investors look for hints as to how everyone from consumers to advertisers are spending their cash.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, recently announced the availability of a new computational analysis method — Tandem Repeat Genotyping Tool (TRGT) — for profiling a huge volume of tandem repeats (TRs) across the human genome (the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism) using its long-read HiFi sequencing data. The TRGT is intended to provide scientists with the ability to obtain a full characterization of the sequence and methylation (a chemical reaction in the body in which a small molecule called a methyl group gets added to DNA, proteins or other molecules) status of TRs genome-wide.PacBio expects that TRGT will enable scientists to better understand the role of known TRs in human disease and could also lead to the discovery of novel disease-causing TRs.The latest availability of PacBio’s TRGT is expected to significantly boost its Computational Biology business globally.Significance of the AvailabilityPer an expert familiar with the TRGT method, it is a key improvement on repeat expansion analysis and will likely aid them in discovering new and potentially vital variants associated with disease in samples from individuals with inherited disorders.Per the management, TRGT has been developed to characterize the genetic and epigenetic variation in TRs, which is one of the most difficult variant classes. Prior to the availability of TRGT, TRs have been understudied due to limitations in the ability of short-read sequencing technologies to sequence these regions of the genome. However, with the combination of HiFi sequencing and TRGT, PacBio intends to provide scientists with the ability to overcome this difficulty and better understand the biological impact.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global computational biology market was valued at $5.5 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $31.5 billion in 2031 at a CAGR of 19.5%. Factors like growing demand for pharmacovigilance, an uptick in adoption and development of advanced software for drug discovery, and demand for predictive models are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen PacBio’s global business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, PacBio announced its second-quarter 2022 results, registering robust increases in its overall top line and both its Product, and Service and other revenues. The company also gained from strength in its Instrument and Consumables revenues during the reported quarter. Robust performance in the Americas was also witnessed.In May, PacBio announced a collaboration with genome analysis company iLAC, Inc. and Robotic Biology Institute, Inc. to develop fully automated end-to-end workflows for PacBio’s Sequel II and Sequel IIe HiFi long-read sequencing systems by employing advanced robotics.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 78.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 35.8% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 17.4% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, PacBio carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

A solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, along with a few positive study outcomes, is expected to contribute further. However, overdependence on technologies and reimbursement uncertainties persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 56.4% compared with a 36.5% decline of the industry and 24% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned radiation oncology company has a market capitalization of $187 million. Accuray’s earnings per share are projected to grow 100% in fiscal 2023 on the back of a continued increase in revenues. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, the average surprise being 20.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Demand: We are upbeat about Accuray’s products registering robust customer adoption over the past few months. On its fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter earnings call in August, the company confirmed that its top line reflected strong customer demand for its products — ClearRT Helical kVCT Imaging for the Radixact System and VOLO Ultra enhancement to the Accuray Precision treatment planning system for the Radixact System. The company also continued to witness robust customer demand for both CyberKnife S7 and Radixact TomoTherapy platforms.Positive Study Outcomes: Accuray has been witnessing favorable study outcomes for its products over the past few months, raising our optimism. This month, the company announced new positive clinical studies, which reinforce the value of the company's CyberKnife platform in the treatment of neurological indications with non-invasive radiosurgery.Accuray, in May, announced that clinical studies continue to validate the versatility of its CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, including the next-generation Radixact System, to accurately and efficiently treat a wide variety of indications of all complexities.Story continuesStrong Q4 Results: Accuray’s narrower-than-expected loss per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 buoyed optimism. Favorable phase III trial data on the Accuray TomoTherapy Helical Radiotherapy System and positive 10-year data about Accuray CyberKnife System bode well. The uptick in gross orders during the reported quarter was also encouraging.DownsidesOverdependence on Technologies: Consumer and third-party payor acceptance of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms as preferred methods of tumor treatment are crucial to Accuray’s continued success. Physicians will not begin to use or increase the use of CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and other factors, that the two platforms are safe and effective alternatives to traditional treatment methods.Reimbursement Uncertainties: Accuray’s customers rely significantly on reimbursement from public and private third-party payors for the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platform procedures. The company’s ability to commercialize its products successfully and increase market acceptance of the same will significantly depend on the extent to which public and private third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with Accuray’s products.Estimate TrendAccuray is witnessing a stable estimate trend for fiscal 2022. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has been stable at breakeven for fiscal 2023 and 11 cents per share for fiscal 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $105.1 million, suggesting a 2.2% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Accuray Incorporated PriceAccuray Incorporated PriceAccuray Incorporated price | Accuray Incorporated QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK.

A good solvency position buoys optimism. Yet, headwinds like seasonality in business, competitive landscape and dependence on government mandates are intimidating. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Chemed has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 1.4% against the industry's 36.3% decline.Chemed ended the second quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share appears promising. Robust performance by the Roto-Rooter segment drove the top line. The company recorded substantial increases in drain cleaning, plumbing, excavation and water restoration revenues in the quarter under review. The expansion of gross and operating margins instills optimism. The decline in operating costs is encouraging too.Chemed’s nursing home admissions for the second quarter rose 5.3%. Assisted living facility admissions increased 5.6% and home-based pre-admit admissions grew 0.2% on a year-over-year basis. The company’s average length of stay in the reported quarter was 103.7 days, up from 94.5 days in the second quarter of 2021. The quarter’s median length of stay of 17 days compared favorably with the 14 days median length of stay in the year-ago period.Chemed has been registering strong performance from the VITAS business over the past few quarters. Although the segment's revenues declined during the second quarter, it was somewhat offset by a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of nearly 1.3%. The company’s second-quarter operating results reflected good earnings performance of the VITAS arm, which exceeded its internal estimates amid the persistent disruption from the pandemic.The company’s latest admission data suggests that senior housing is in the process of stabilization and recovery. The company’s 2022 outlook anticipates a continued acceleration in the senior housing base census throughout the year.Story continuesChemed Corporation PriceChemed Corporation PriceChemed Corporation price | Chemed Corporation QuoteOn the flip side, Chemed’s VITAS revenues registered a 4.5% year-over-year decline in second-quarter 2022, raising apprehension. The VITAS arm continued to be challenged by pandemic-related issues, including health care labor shortages, disruption in senior housing occupancy and related hospice referrals. In the reported quarter, VITAS admissions totaled 14,735 patients, down 12.5% on a year-over-year basis. The company also witnessed a 20.5% decline in hospital-directed admissions compared to the year-ago period.During the second quarter, Chemed’s average daily census was 17,315 patients, a decline of 3.8% year over year. Per management, this decline directly resulted from pandemic-related disruptions across the entire health care system since March 2020.The deterioration in short-term cash levels is worrisome. The persistent macroeconomic headwinds related to the volatility in COVID-19 trends, rising inflationary pressure and other challenges continue to hamper business performance. A competitive landscape and reimbursement headwinds are other challenges.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

The company’s earnings and revenues for the second quarter of 2022 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The impressive Cologuard volume growth buoys optimism. A promising solvency position is an added advantage. However, mounting expenses and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 65.1% compared with a 40.4% decline of the industry It belongs to and a 17.2% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $5.66 billion. Its net loss of 94 cents per share in the second quarter was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.07.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 19.6% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 18.1% and the S&amp;P 500’s estimated 11.2% increase.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ2 Upsides: Exact Sciences exited the second quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The decline in quarterly loss compared with the year-ago period is encouraging. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the second-quarter top line. The legacy Screening business was driven by impressive Cologuard volume growth and contributions from the PreventionGenetics, Biomatrica and Oncoguard Liver products. The growing uptake of the Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products also instills optimism.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdvancing New Solutions: Exact Sciences is planning several key milestones to bring six innovative cancer diagnostics from its pipeline to patients in need. In this regard, the company made noteworthy progress in enrolling cases to power the prospective BLUE-C study in the second quarter. The results from the BLUE-C trial are anticipated to support FDA submissions for Cologuard 2.0 — the next-generation Cologuard and colon blood tests.Story continuesExact Sciences has also initiated a study with the West German Study Group to validate its tumor-informed ctDNA liquid biopsy test’s ability to identify minimum residual disease in hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer patients.Overall Strong Solvency: Exact Sciences exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $728 million. The company reported long-term debt of $50 million on its balance sheet at the end of second-quarter 2022, much lower than its current short-term cash level, indicating a good solvency position. This is good news, particularly during an overall tough macroeconomic scenario when the company is facing a global manufacturing and supply halt.DownsidesEscalating Costs: In the second quarter, Exact Sciences’ sales and marketing expenses increased 10.8%. General and administrative expenses rose 8.4% year over year. These mounting expenses pushed up adjusted operating costs by 7.5%, resulting in an adjusted operating loss in the quarter, weighing significantly on the company’s bottom line.Persistent COVID-19 Impacts: The Screening and Precision Oncology businesses have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company expects any future COVID outbreaks to diminish access to healthcare provider offices. Further, pandemic-led cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions continue to impact the company’s operations.Tough Competitive Landscape: Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, Exact Science faces numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than the company. The company is aware of at least 13 firms, including Epigenomics AG, EDP Biotech Corporation, etc., which have developed or are developing liquid biopsy tests for colorectal cancer detection.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences’ loss for 2022 has moved down from $4.27 to $4.22.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.01 billion, suggesting a 13.9% rise from the 2021 reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

A robust second-quarter 2022 performance, along with a few recent buyouts, is expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and regulatory requirements persist.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 40.9% compared with 19.3% decline of the industry and 17.4% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global medical products manufacturer specializing in surgical instruments and devices has a market capitalization of $2.37 billion. The company projects 11.2% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in the other, the average surprise being 4.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Recent Buyouts: CONMED’s recent acquisitions raise our optimism. The company, in August, completed its previously-announced acquisition of privately-held Biorez, Inc. Per the management, the addition of Biorez and its proprietary BioBrace platform is expected to strengthen its sports medicine portfolio.In June, CONMED completed its previously-announced acquisition of privately-held In2Bones Global Inc., which will likely boost its Orthopedic portfolio.Broad Product Spectrum: CONMED offers a broad line of surgical products, which includes several new devices in the Orthopedic, Laparoscopic, Robotic, Open Surgery, Gastroenterology, Pulmonary and Cardiology sections. Products like Hi-Fi Tape and Hi-Fi suture interface represent a critical component of repair security in the rotator cuff repair space.Other notable offerings include the MicroFree platform in Orthopedics, the TruShot, the Y-Knot Pro and the CRYSTALVIEW Pump. The Anchor Tissue Retrieval bag is a unique product under the General Surgery arm.Strong Q2 Results: CONMED’s solid second-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed strong segmental performances across its Orthopedic and General Surgery units. It saw sales growth in domestic and overseas markets. The expansion of both gross and operating margins bodes well for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesRegulatory Requirements: Almost all of CONMED’s products are classified as class II medical devices subject to regulations of numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its international counterparts. As a medical device manufacturer, the company’s manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on-site inspection and continuing review by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System Regulations. CONMED may have future inspections at its sites and there can be no assurance that the costs of responding to such inspections will not be material.Stiff Competition: The market for CONMED’s products is highly competitive and its customers have numerous alternatives of supply. Many of the company’s competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which it competes, making such competitors more attractive to surgeons, hospitals, group-purchasing organizations and others.Estimate TrendCONMED is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 5.7% south to $3.32.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $282.2 million, suggesting a 13.4% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

One way to choose the right stocks is to follow rating upgrades by brokers.In this regard, stocks like Hyatt Hotels Corporation H, McKesson Corporation MCK and Carlsberg A/S CABGY are worth considering.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper insight into what is happening in a particular company. They diligently review companies’ publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have a more understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Selecting the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help you in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (Four Weeks) of 1% or More: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price Greater Than $5: The stocks must trade above $5.Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank Equal to #1 or 2: Despite good or bad market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are the three stocks that qualified for the screening:Hyatt Hotels, based in Chicago, IL, is a leading global hospitality company.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Colgate-Palmolive, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Colgate-Palmolive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Colgate-Palmolive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Colgate-Palmolive is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.8% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$62m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Colgate-Palmolive. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Colgate-Palmolive .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Unfortunately, many of the communities most severely impacted are BIPOC communities. According to a 2021 Environmental Protection Agency analysis that quantifies six types of environmental impacts like air quality and extreme temperatures, Black and African American individuals are projected to face higher impacts of climate change, compared to all other demographic groups. However, the voices of those most affected by climate change are rarely reflected or engaged in finding the solutions. That's why Tom's of Maine is introducing its first-ever Incubator initiative.FIRST-EVER TOM’S OF MAINE INCUBATOR TO ELEVATE NEXT GENERATION OF BIPOC ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS.The Tom's of Maine Incubator is a seven-month program designed to propel the next generation of BIPOC leaders driving environmental solutions.

And the young diverse voices who are trying to find environmental solutions are not receiving equal opportunities to be heard and supported,"" says Scribner. ""I am helping to launch the 2022 Tom's of Maine Incubator to address these gaps because it's critical to give young BIPOC leaders the resources they need to build and broaden solutions to truly benefit all people.""""As a company that has a long history of being environmental stewards, we see climate change as the greatest threat to a healthy future for people and our planet.

The hawkish move of the Fed to cut down inflation (having increased interest rate fives time already in 2022), concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a strong dollar are causing the weakness in the stock market.The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry’s performance too has been affected. The industry has lost 13.7% year to date. Amid this, players like MetLife Inc. MET, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG, Old Republic International Corporation ORI and Radian Group Inc. RDN, who have an impressive dividend history, offer a breather.By virtue of the nature of their business, multiline insurers stand to benefit from a diversified portfolio that in turn lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness driving higher demand for protection products should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing should support the premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in the exposure of intangibles and increase in cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, The Swiss Re Institute estimates an increase in demand for insurance coverage across the globe, that in turn will drive a 3.9% rise in premiums in 2022. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 4% while non-life insurance premium is expected to increase 3.7% in 2022.The Fed’s hawkish move is a boon for the insurance industry as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three multiline insurers that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold), a dividend yield of more than 2% as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 2%.

Also, given the strong credit characteristics of the new loans insured, we expect the company to see fewer claims than before. Radian Group maintains a solid balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and strong cash flows.

293,916cae83-92a0-3088-85f7-e37cf988fe2e,DVN,2022-09-29,Jim Cramer Says Buy These 2 High-Yield Dividend Stocks — Including One With 10% Yield,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-buy-2-002323365.html,1664411003,STORY,"['DVN', 'KEY']","[Wall Street is on a roller coaster again, as investors try to navigate the path between high inflation and the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes. The former is raging – whether you blame Russia or Biden, the fact of high inflation can no longer be avoided – while the latter is rising – but whether it is rising fast enough to blunt inflation is yet to be determined.Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, takes a hint from the bond market, where the US Treasury 2-year note is up to 4.3% lately. In Cramer’s view, this sharp rise in the mid-term Treasury note indicates further aggressive Federal Reserve action on interest rates – and that brings with it an increased risk of a general economic recession.This, in turn, brings Cramer to a specific investment choice – high-yield dividend stocks. “You want to take shelter in the accidental high-yielders because their dividends will give you a cushion,” Cramer noted.To find these ‘accidental high-yielders,’ Cramer screened the S&amp;P 500 index, seeking out stocks off 30% or more from peak values and yielding 4% or better on the dividend.Cramer gives several of these stocks his personal approval. We’ve pulled up the details on two of his picks from the TipRanks database, and we’ll look at them together with commentary from the Street’s analysts.Devon Energy Corporation (DVN)The first of Cramer’s picks that we’ll check out is Devon Energy, an Oklahoma City-based, independent, hydrocarbon exploration and production company focused on onshore assets in the US. Devon operates mainly in the Delaware Basin, one of the major oil and gas formations on the border between West Texas and New Mexico. But while the Texas ops make up the core of the company’s work, Devon is also active in Colorado, Montana, and Oklahoma.Devon is in the midst of an expansionary move, and in early August the company announced a definitive acquisition agreement for Validus Energy, an operator in the Texan Eagle Ford formation. The acquisition is cash transaction, worth $1.8 billion, will be effective as of June 1, 2022, on its Q3 closing.Story continuesIn the meantime, Devon has reported its 2Q22 financial results, and investors can take heart. The company had the highest revenues in over two years, at $6.27 billion, but that was just the top line. Drilling down, Devon reported net income of $1.9 billion, or $2.59 per diluted share. This was up from just 60 cents diluted EPS in the year-ago quarter, and is indicative of the rapid rise in the company’s revenues and earnings over the past 6 quarters. Even better, for investors, was the $2.1 billion in free cash flow reported for 2Q22, a company record for Devon.That free cash flow is important because it guarantees funding of the dividend. The payment, on a fixed-plus-variable model, was last declared for a September 30 payout at $1.55 per common share. This was up 22% from the previous quarter, and the highest single dividend that Devon has ever paid. On an annualized basis, the div reaches $6.20 and yields 10.4%.Giving the bullish view on Devon, Truist’s 5-star analyst Neal Dingmann notes the Validus acquisition as a net positive, but he sees the company as strong even without that.“Devon continues to demonstrate highly successful operational results which when coupled with strong prices and contained costs, leads to record shareholder returns. The company once again paid out an all-time high dividend while simultaneously buying back shares and repaying debt,"" Dingmann noted.""We still receive investor questions whether DVN will continue with its strict capital discipline, with the short answer being that per share growth not absolute production growth will continue to be the mantra. So while the base dividend could increase further and share repurchases could expand, in our view all the factors should continue to add up to one of the best cash return models in the group,"" the analyst added.Going from these comments, Dingmann rates DVN a Buy, with a $115 price target implying ~92% one-year upside potential. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~102% potential total return profile. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here)Overall, there are 10 recent reviews on DVN, and they are evenly split – 5 Buys, and 5 Holds. This gives the stock a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. Meanwhile, DVN shares are trading at $60.05 and their $83.79 average price target implies an upside of ~40% from that level. (See DVN stock forecast on TipRanks)KeyCorp (KEY)We’ll shift our focus now, as Cramer’s second high-yielding div stock is a Bancorp, KeyCorp, the holding company with ownership of KeyBank. This large-cap banking company operates through more than 1,000 full-service branches and offices, plus some 1,300 ATMs, in 15 states, and boasts over $181 billion in total assets.That’s a strong foundation on which to support a business, and KeyCorp has been successful at doing just that for almost 200 years. The company offers a full range of banking services, including loans, savings and checking accounts, online and mobile banking, mortgages, wealth management – all the familiar banking needs – for retail, small business, and commercial customers.In the recent second quarter of 2022, the company had total revenue of $1.8 billion, well in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range it has hit for the past 8 quarters. On earnings, KeyCorp showed $504 million in net income, up 20% y/y, and EPS came in at 54 cents per diluted common share. This was down from the 72 cents reported in the year-ago quarter, but still solidly profitable – and more than enough to cover the 19.5 cent per common share dividend payment.That dividend was last declared in July for the September 15 payment. At its current rate, the dividend annualizes to 78 cents and yields a solid 4.8%. The dividend’s long history of reliability – the company has never missed a payment, going back to 1990 – helps show why it kept Cramer’s interest.KeyCorp has reformed its business practices in recent months, and 5-star analyst Gerard Cassidy of RBC sees this as a net positive.“The rebuilt, de-risked, better-managed KEY is continuing to demonstrate to investors it is not the 'old KEY'. This change can be seen in its strong credit metrics and diversified business model. Its 'Targeted Scale' strategy, not being all things to all customers but rather being relevant to customers that KEY wants to be relevant, has boosted shareholder returns, in our opinion. Additionally, its strong 'right-side' of the balance sheet will become more valuable in a rising interest rate environment. Lastly, KEY should continue to reward shareholders with robust capital action plans in 2022-2023,"" Cassidy opined.Cassidy quantifies his comments with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, as well as a $29 price target that indicates potential for 79% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Cassidy’s track record, click here)Overall, KEY gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 6 Buy ratings, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock’s average price target of $22.19 gives ~37% upside to the current price of $16.17.

This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock's valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Dillard's Inc., United Rentals Inc. and Unum Group.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large  The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Story continuesInvestors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability.

The only solution that embeds banking services into a cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, NetSuite AP Automation helps organizations improve profitability by making it easier and faster to process bills and pay vendors all from within NetSuite. As a result, organizations can better control outgoing cash flows and easily scale end-to-end accounts payable processes.""Accounts payable plays an important role in helping organizations manage cash flow, control costs, and maintain strong relationships with vendors, but all too often the process is slow, tedious, and error-prone,"" said Evan Goldberg, founder and EVP, Oracle NetSuite. ""By simplifying and automating the entire bill payment process – from data capture to payment and reconciliation – NetSuite AP Automation eliminates these challenges. This helps businesses streamline and improve a key operation, empowering AP teams to operate more efficiently and ultimately reduce costs.""With automated payment services provided by HSBC, payment processing is simpler, faster, and more accurate.

""Business customers increasingly want integrated, accessible solutions at their fingertips. Our embedded banking solution with NetSuite allows customers to manage payments and automate reconciliations at the point of need, without switching screens or multiple logins.""Story continuesNetSuite AP AutomationWith NetSuite AP Automation, eligible transactions completed with an HSBC virtual credit card earn credit, which further reduces operating costs and turns accounts payable from a cost center into a revenue generator.NetSuite AP Automation helps organizations:Bill Capture: Capture vendor bills more quickly and with fewer errors by removing manual data entry and automating the entire bill capture process. Bills are scanned using AI/ML-based object detection and optical character recognition, and relevant details, like vendor name, PO number, items ordered, quantity, and pricing are then converted into digital text. NetSuite automatically creates a bill record, using artificial intelligence based on previous bill entries and pre-populates the appropriate fields. A side-by-side view of the actual bill makes it easier for AP teams to review and approve.Bill Matching and Approvals: Avoid overpayment, duplicate payments, or fraudulent payment of vendor bills. Automated bill matching ensures vendor bills are two- or three-way matched with the associated purchase orders to ensure details such as unit pricing, quantity, and totals are accurate. Using SuiteApprovals, bills are routed to the appropriate personnel for review and approval, with automated reminders so bills are not left unpaid resulting in late charges and outstanding debts.Payment Automation: Increase the accuracy and speed of payment processing. Vendor payments are processed through HSBC services with payment options of ACH, check, or virtual credit card. The payer's current bank account can be used to fund payments. The HSBC virtual credit card offers qualified customers an easy and secure way to pay vendors without the risks of maintaining a physical credit card. The automatically generated single-use card numbers provide an additional layer of protection. Vendors are notified of paid bills upon successful payment.● Payment Reconciliation: Improve the accuracy of accounting data by eliminating error-prone manual reconciliation and enabling a faster financial close. An intelligent rules engine matches and reconciles virtual credit card charges while flagging discrepancies for further review by accounting staff. Additionally, missing entries, such as bank fees, can be created automatically, saving time and eliminating potential errors.● SuiteBanking Center: Gain full visibility into – and control over – transactions and real-time balances for HSBC online checking and credit card accounts. The dashboard provides users with full visibility into their HSBC online accounts, status of payables, and payments history.NetSuite AP Automation is part of NetSuite SuiteBanking.

Oracle will pay $8 million in disgorgement and the rest $15 million as a penalty to settle all the charges.According to the SEC report, Oracle violated provisions of the act between 2016 and 2019 when its subsidiaries in India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates created slush funds that were used to bribe foreign officials.Oracle’s subsidiaries also used the funds to pay foreign officials to attend technology conferences, and in some cases, these funds were also used for officials’ families to either accompany them or take side trips.This is the second time that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has faced such a charge, with the previous instance also including the company’s India unit. The SEC fined Oracle $2 million in 2012 for setting aside about $2.2 million for unauthorized side funds in its India-based subsidiary.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteIncreasing Instances of Employee MisconductIn 2016, a representative from Oracle Turkey sales implemented a scheme where he falsely claimed that he needed a significant discount on a deal with Turkey’s Social Security Institute (SSI) due to intense competition from other vendors.Oracle United Arab Emirates (UAE) sales employees used excessive discounts and marketing reimbursement payments to make slush funds at resellers from at least 2014 to 2019.An Oracle UAE sales account manager for a state-owned entity paid about $130,000 in bribes to the entity’s chief technology officer for six contracts between 2018 and 2019. Two resellers helped to fund the first three bribes with excessive discounts. The bribes were paid through an entity that was not an Oracle-approved reseller for public sector transactions.The only purpose for the entity was making bribes, although it was also used as a reseller for the final three deals.Oracle India’s sales employees reportedly used an excessive discount scheme that pertained to a transaction with a transportation company in which the majority owner is the Ministry of Railways. The employees working on the deal cited competition from other OEMs and alleged that the agreement would be lost if a 70% discount was not provided on the software component of the contract.Story continuesIncreasing Adoption of Cloud Offerings to Drive Top LineNonetheless, accelerated digital transformation along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid work model is likely to drive demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the near term.BurgerFi BFI has been expanding rapidly since going public in 2020.

(NYSE:PLD) sold US$54m worth of stock at an average price of US$147 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. The company’s market cap plunged by US$6.4b after price dropped by 7.8% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisThe Co-Founder, Hamid Moghadam, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$46m worth of shares at a price of US$145 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$102. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Prologis shares, than buying.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of PrologisMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.1% of Prologis shares, worth about US$91m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Prologis shares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at Prologis in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort.

Categories could be as simple as baking essentials and sweets or more personalized like weeknight meals and kid-friendly foods.Label generously: When emptying dry food items into clear jars, label it with the name of the food item and be sure to include expiration date, especially for items that are not consumed often.Leverage vertical space: Stackable storage items like the Ball® Stack &amp; Store Jars allow for better grouping and space utilization. Risers are also great for items like spices and canned goods to provide a better vantage point of what's available.Place items with access in mind: Put frequently used items where they can be easily accessed.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published a midyear research update to its 2022 U.S. Retirement Market Outlook evaluating the firm's retirement savings guidance in light of current market volatility and lower expected market returns.Key Highlights:Current market volatility and lower expected returns do not warrant a change in the firm's suggested retirement saving strategies for most workers, and investors should resist the urge to react to market events in the short term.However, older workers, especially those close to retirement, will have less time to recoup lower returns and may need to make up that ground by increasing their savings.In general, 401(k) participants have been staying the course. During the first half of 2022, over 95% have not made any investment exchanges, and less than 1% of workers fully invested in target date funds made any investment changes.The research paper was authored by Judith Ward, CFP®, Thought Leadership Director, and Sudipto Banerjee, Ph.D., Vice President, Retirement Thought Leadership.""We continue to suggest that workers save at least 15%, including any employer contribution, of their annual salary for retirement,"" says Ward. ""This is a rule of thumb. In practice, the suggested savings rate will vary from person to person, usually increasing for people with higher incomes. For those close to retirement but unable to meet their retirement savings benchmarks, they might consider delaying retirement for a year or two, taking part‑time work in retirement, or making spending adjustments.""The research update also evaluated T. Rowe Price's recordkeeping data to determine whether retirement savers actually changed course during the first half of the year.Story continues""For most of the first half of 2022, average 401(k) contribution rates stayed relatively stable,"" says Banerjee. ""More recently, however, the average contribution has trended slightly downward, suggesting workers may be reducing contributions to cope with inflation. If high inflation persists and the downward trend in 401(k) contribution rates is prolonged, it could become problematic because retirement savings might fall.""In response to these findings, Ward and Banerjee suggest that employers can help workers stay on the right path with saving for retirement through higher plan-level adoption of target date products, communicating risks to workers of trying to time the market, providing access to emergency savings vehicles, and providing access to retirement income tools, products and services. Ward and Banerjee also offer the following guidance to individual investors on how they can adapt to current market turmoil:Retirees review their spending expectations: Based on the firm's research, a conservative approach, based on a 4% initial withdrawal rate, could be part of a sustainable spending plan, even when retirement starts in times of significant market selloffs.Build up their cash reserves: Workers are advised to have an emergency fund that could cover three to six months of expenses. When heading into retirement, Ward and Banerjee suggest a cash buffer that could cover one to two years of spending.Maintain an appropriate asset allocation for long-term success: An appropriate allocation between stocks and bonds can provide current income and stability while also offering the growth potential necessary for a long retirement. Diversifying within each asset category is also important.Leverage educational programs and build a plan: T. Rowe Price suggests savers take advantage of financial wellness education and programs offered by their employer, or work with their financial professional to assess options and craft a plan that works best for their personal situation and stage of their retirement journey.See the summary and supporting data for recommendations for individuals.ABOUT T.

Rowe Price Group, Inc. in the United States, European Union, and other countries.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThe principal value of the Target Date Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The fundsʼ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds and derivatives will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long‑term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump‑sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons. Derivatives may be riskier or more volatile than other types of investments because they are generally more sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions.All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and interest-rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. International investments can be riskier than U.S. investments due to the adverse effects of currency exchange rates, differences in market structure and liquidity, as well as specific country, regional, and economic developments. Small-cap stocks have generally been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks. The prices of sector focused funds tend to be more volatile than more diversified funds.Consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing.

Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.T. Rowe Price Investment Services, Inc., Distributor, T.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 1.97% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.88%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.24%.Heading into today, shares of the package delivery service had lost 15.52% over the past month, lagging the Transportation sector's loss of 14.61% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.93% in that time.United Parcel Service will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, United Parcel Service is projected to report earnings of $2.86 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.54%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $24.39 billion, up 5.19% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.85 per share and revenue of $101.67 billion, which would represent changes of +5.94% and +4.5%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% lower. United Parcel Service is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, United Parcel Service is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 12.83. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 10.88, which means United Parcel Service is trading at a premium to the group.Meanwhile, UPS's PEG ratio is currently 1.45.

(UPS) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-united-parcel-inc-130001528.html,1664370001,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned -15.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has lost 20.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $12.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.16 indicates a change of +2.4% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $24.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.2%. The $101.67 billion and $103.62 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +1.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $24.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $3.29 for the same period compares with $3.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.14%. The EPS surprise was +4.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

322,9a5eefa5-e330-3baa-a919-c14c560806fe,AXP,2022-09-29,Here's Why You Should Add AmEx (AXP) to Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-add-amex-axp-170605576.html,1664384765,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express Company AXP is well poised to grow on the back of strategic acquisitions, increasing business volumes and investments in digital technology. The ongoing recovery in travel-related spending can also be a major boon for AmEx.AmEx — with a market cap of $103.1 billion — is a diversified financial services company, offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. It operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides fraud-prevention tools. Courtesy of solid prospects, this presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is worth investing in at the moment.Trend in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP’s current-year earnings is pegged at $9.88 per share, which rose 0.6% in the past 60 days. The stock has witnessed five upward estimate revisions during this period against none in the opposite direction. American Express beat on earnings in each of the last four quarters, the average being 17.7%.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues is $52.8 billion, indicating a 24.7% rise from the prior-year reported number.Key MarkersAmEx is likely to hire about 1,500 new people in technology-related jobs, at a time when financial companies are either freezing their hiring process or cutting jobs due to economic uncertainty. The move reflects AmEx’s confidence in its capabilities to navigate through any downturns and the economy’s resilience. Of the total hiring target, 60% will likely be in the United States, 33.3% in India and the rest in Europe.Accelerating the tech hiring process is in line with AXP’s strategy to focus on intensifying technology investments, which is expected to boost its long-term growth. The company has already hired more than 3,600 technical workers this year. The company is expected to keep investing in technology as income opportunities keep growing. Spendings on travel and entertainment are likely to go up in the coming days, especially as the holiday season approaches.Story continuesThe Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) lifting the 15-month ban on AmEx after it complied with the data storage policy is a major positive. Being the second largest country by population in the world, India possesses a massive payment market. Per the RBI data, at the second quarter-end, AmEx had only 1.4 million credit cards in the country, which is 1.7% of the overall cards in circulation. Following the decision from RBI, AmEx can tap into its enhanced infrastructure in the country to capitalize on the growing demand for digital payments.Our estimate for AmEx’s total network volumes for 2022 suggests a 28.4% year-over-year increase. While we expect network volumes in the United States to increase by 29.2%, the same in the international market is likely to rise by 26.6%. Also, our estimate for total cards in force indicates 9.9% year-over-year growth.Strategic acquisitions and alliances are expected to boost the company’s profits in the days ahead. Acquisitions like Kabbage and strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton, Amazon and others are likely to rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. AXP also has robust cash-generating abilities in place through which business investment and prudent shareholder-friendly moves are undertaken.RisksThere are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. For instance, AXP’s rising expenses are putting pressure on margins. The increase in reward expenses and card member services will weigh on the bottom line.Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive AmEx’s growth in the long term.Other Top-Ranked PlayersSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are CI Financial Corp. CIXX, Owl Rock Capital Corporation ORCC and Primis Financial Corp.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -11.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has lost 13.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, American Express is expected to post earnings of $2.38 per share, indicating a change of +4.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.88 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.4%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.45 indicates a change of +16% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for American Express.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AXP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For American Express, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +23.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.83 billion and $59.33 billion estimates indicate +24.7% and +12.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $13.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30.8%. EPS of $2.57 for the same period compares with $2.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.77%. The EPS surprise was +8.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks Are Holding Up in the Bear MarketThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Index has slipped into the bear market. Following yesterday's decline of 1.1%, the index is now down 20.5% from its Jan 4 peak (hence meeting the definition of a bear market).Worries that the Federal Reserve's aggressive stance to fight decade-high inflation will push the U.S. economy into a downturn have weighed on investor sentiments since the beginning of 2022. This has sent the domestic equity markets tumbling after a solid performance last year.The Dow, the 30-stock blue-chip index, rallied almost 19% in 2021. But macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have led to a pessimistic stance since the start of this year. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa and American Express – that are part of the index.So far this year, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP have plunged 32.6%, 23%, 16.7% and 16%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in quality franchises.While the central bank's efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the coming six-nine months remain a big headwind. Until now, consumer confidence and spending are holding up well, but with the steady rate increase, these are likely to witness weakness.Hence, investors are shying away from stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Story continuesLet's now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM's balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The company has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of the competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, which will strengthen its operations through technological advancement.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM's deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2022, total loans grew 6% year over year to $1.1 trillion.While higher rates and the expected global economic slowdown will continue hampering investment banking (IB) business, JPMorgan's leading position in garnering global IB fees will offer leverage. Also, ongoing macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions should keep the markets volatile in the quarters ahead, helping the company earn measurable trading revenues (which account for almost 25% of its total net revenues).Also, JPM currently pays investors $4.00 per share as an annual dividend, which yields 3.66%. The company increased its dividend four times in the past five years, and its payout grew 14.82% over the same time period. JPM's payout ratio is 32% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past week.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses, while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In April 2022, this Zacks Rank #3 company acquired Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, while in March, it closed the acquisition of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, it completed the purchase of Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Further, its asset management division has announced a deal to acquire robo-advisor NextCapital.The company's IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first half of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman's solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Backed by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders' value. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share in July. Prior to this, it announced a dividend hike by 60% to $2 per share last year.Based on the dividend paid out over the trailing four quarters, GS has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In the last five years, the company has increased its dividend five times, with an annualized growth rate of 25.7%. Further, the company's payout ratio is 18% of earnings.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 8.66, which is lower than the industry average of 12.45. Also, its P/B ratio of 0.96 is below the industry average of 1.54.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay, and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.V enjoys compelling cash and available-for-sale investment position along with a healthy free cash flow, which enables it to make acquisitions and fund capital expenditure. Backed by its strong cash position, it remains committed to boosting shareholders' value. Visa has increased its dividend each year since 2009, with the latest being a 17% hike in October 2021 to 37.5 cents per share. The stock has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 16.6%. Further, the payout ratio of V is 21% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has moved marginally upward, while that for 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top line in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #2 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that American Express is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company also forms strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It recently announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The company has robust cash-generating abilities in place through which business investment and prudent shareholder-friendly moves are undertaken. This March, the company announced a hike of around 20% in the quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share. The company has a dividend yield of 1.48% and five-year annualized dividend growth of 7.2%. Further, AXP's payout ratio is 21% of earnings at present.Also, American Express currently has a Value Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The company has produced a hefty, 200-plus-page print edition, its first physical magazine since shuttering print operations amid the pandemic in early 2021.The new issue focuses heavily on travel; the cover feature is a sumptuous tour of Italy, from Rome to Naples to Stromboli, photographed by Cedric Buchet and written by Christopher Bollen. And travel makes up more than half of the 40-plus advertisers and close to 100 ad pages, marketing a surfeit of luxury brands including Hermès, Gucci, Tiffany &amp; Co., Cartier, David Yurman, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental and private jet charter service Wheels Up.More from WWDInside Little Cat Lodge in Hillsdale, NYA Look Inside Aman New YorkWhere to Stay and Dine in New York This FallThe magazine — which arrives in mailboxes after an unprecedented post-pandemic summer travel boom — is intended as both reference guide and keepsake. Printed on premium paper stock that has become all but extinct in magazine publishing, the cover is uncluttered by headlines and features a photograph of model Bianca O’Brien (also on Vogue’s September issue) on an Italian street wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and Magali Pascal shorts. Multimedia artist Susan Cianciolo was photographed by Andy Jackson for a feature about New York visionaries.In her editor’s letter, Skye Parrott, who joined Departures as executive editor after the magazine transitioned to an all-digital format, notes that the print format “lends itself to different, beautiful ways of telling stories. We love making things, and many of us love to hold an actual object when we read.”Some of the pieces in the issue — which include a profile of motorcycle-riding, leather-clad architect Peter Marino (who is reimagining the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship on Fifth Avenue) and features about Lima, Peru and painter Kehinde Wiley’s compound in Senegal — are truncated versions of digital features. And everything in the magazine can be found on the digital site, including via “read more” QR codes at the end of each print story. In its heyday, Departures, which was run for 17 years by legendary editor Richard David Story, transcended its elite readership (the magazine, like the special print edition, is mailed to American Express Platinum card holders) to a position of influence within the New York magazine scene. And its ability to attract luxury advertisers eager to target wealthy consumers made it enviably profitable among its print competitors. One estimate put its revenue at $50 million annually during its peak. So the current special print issue could be interpreted as a test balloon for additional forays into print. A representative for American Express declined to comment on the specter of additional future print issues. But when Departures exited its publishing deal in 2021, shifting to its current digital-first format, executives did not rule out print entirely.]"

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.Break out your mugs and get ready to celebrate with some delicious news to start the day—today, October 1, is International Coffee Day! What is International Coffee Day? A way for coffee lovers to make sure they get the ultimate caffeine fix, of course. But in all seriousness, it's an annual event that aims to shed light on the coffee growing and trading that takes place around the world.It just so happens that National Coffee Day was mere days ago on Thursday, September 29. If you missed the special occasion, you're in luck. Coffee aficionados are in for some tasty drinks today, too. While you can grab a latte on the road, there are also countless gadgets to help you make that perfect brew right at home.Get expert shopping advice delivered to your phone. Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting nerds at Reviewed.At Reviewed, we test products year-round to recommend to you the best and, boy, we have some coffee recommendations for you. Here are 11 products to take your morning coffee to the next level.►International Coffee Day 2022: Celebrate International Coffee Day with the best gifts for coffee lovers1. The perfect drip coffee makersThe Moccamaster and Black &amp; Decker not only look great but brew a mean cup of coffee.If we can say one thing about coffee makers, it's to never underestimate the power of drip coffee. There are thousands of brewers available on the market, which can make it tough to narrow down your choices. But don't worry—we've tested the most popular full-size drip brewers to find the best one. The results: The Technivorm Moccamaster KBG reigned supreme for its fast brewing speed, well-made design and ability to brew smooth coffee. While it's on the pricier side, it brews a complex pot of coffee, enough to serve multiple people (or refill your mug multiple times), giving you quality coffee for your morning commute or afternoon pick-me-up.Story continuesFor something a little more budget-friendly, we love the Black &amp; Decker 12-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker. It makes brew-tifully smooth and flavorful coffee and is very simple to use. This coffee maker even outperformed some of the high-end brands we tested it against, proving to be an affordable staple for the kitchen.$329 at Amazon $83.72 at Amazon2. The best bean roasterUse this bean roaster to get your beans as dark as you like.Roasting coffee beans yourself can help you make the perfect brew by ensuring that your beans are as dark as you want. Based on thorough market research, we determined that the Nuvo Eco Ceramic Handy Coffee Roaster is the best roaster you can buy online. The Nuvo Eco combines form with function, as the beautiful ceramic roaster efficiently heats up to 70 coffee beans at once. The eco-friendly material can get very hot, but thanks to the heat-blocking handle, you'll be protected from nasty burns.$30 at Amazon3. Our favorite coffee grindersThe Baratza and Krups coffee grinders feature everything you need to make delicious, freshly ground coffee.While the convenience of pre-ground coffee surely can't be beaten, there's a reason coffee aficionados prefer to grind their own beans right before brewing. Soon after coffee beans are exposed to air, the beans and their flavor begin to dissipate, even if the coffee comes in a vacuum-sealed bag.That's why buying a good coffee grinder is key for the perfect cup. Out of all the coffee grinders we've tested, the Baratza Encore gave us perfect beans both for a fine grind for an espresso machine and a coarse grind for a French press. The machine is durable and simple to use. Plus, it features 40-grind settings to choose from, making it a pick above the rest.While a blade grinder can't produce as much coffee grinds at once, they don't overheat beans and they provide a very even grind. We prefer the Krups Fast Touch Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder when it comes to blade grinders. It's easy to use, doubles as a spice grinder and is a lot easier on the wallet than most coffee grinders.$170 at Amazon$22 at Target4. Our favorite Nespresso machinesNespresso machines are quick and user-friendly, making mornings that much easier.If convenience is key for you, pod-operated coffee makers can be a life-saver. And if you don't want to skimp on quality, Nespresso machines have found a way to beautifully combine convenience and high-quality coffee.We've tested a wide array of Nespresso machines and found the Nespresso VertuoPlus by Breville machine to be our favorite single-serve coffee maker. This compact machine packs a punch, offering fast brewing and plenty of coffee options from regular coffee to double espresso drinks.For a more affordable single-serve machine, the Nespresso Lattisima Plus by De'Longhi is an all-in-one coffee maker that allows you to make quality espresso shots, lattes or cappuccinos with just a touch of the button. The machine itself is very easy to clean, with some of the parts being dishwasher-friendly.$157.24 at Amazon$320 at Amazon5. Our favorite coffee percolatorIf you like your coffee dark, you need a percolator.While nothing beats the convenience of drip makers or pod machines such as Keurig, there are instances when the seasoned coffee percolator outshines its automated brethren. If you fancy your coffee dark and strong, you can't go wrong by using a percolator. A percolator is especially helpful if you’re looking to make a large brew as they typically boast larger capacities.  After extensive testing, we found the best coffee percolator to be the Maxi-Matic Elite Platinum EC-120 12 Cup Percolator. It offers modern safety features, can be lifted off of the heating element for easy serving and, most importantly, makes flavorful, delicious coffee (up to 12 cups at once!).$48 at Amazon6. An affordable yet high-performing milk frotherOur top-tested milk frother, the Instant Milk Frother, is perfect for any budget.Frothy, foamy milk—it's necessary for making the perfect latte or cappuccino. We've tested several milk frothers available on the market and found the Instant Milk Frother to be the best option out there at a surprising $30 sticker price. This milk frother that is made by the same brand that gave us the Instant Pot easily creates foam no matter what temperature or type of milk (such as almond or oat milk) that you use.$38 at Amazon7. A coffee subscription to help you discover new beansIf you're looking for new coffee to drink, you should try a coffee subscription service.If you're a self-described coffee snob, then you're probably always looking for the best coffee beans you can get your hands on. Thankfully, coffee subscriptions can help you discover and explore new coffee beans from across the world.Our favorite coffee subscription service that we've ever tested is from Counter Culture Coffee. The brand is totally transparent when it comes to its beans, giving information about the origin, altitude and roasting date. The subscription changes constantly, offering new beans and plenty of chances to expand your coffee palate.Another great coffee subscription service comes from Atlas Coffee Club. What we like about Atlas is the fact that each delivery brings you roasts from a different country of origin. With Atlas Coffee Club, you’ll experience the wide range of flavors that the globe has to offer.Shop Counter CultureShop Atlas Coffee Club8. Our favorite French pressThe SterlingPro SS Double Wall Cafetiere received high marks across the board on all of our tests.While French presses require a little more work than other coffee makers, the fruits of their labor are so, so tasty. It's no surprise that baristas and coffee enthusiasts love the French press. After testing plenty of French presses, Reviewed ranked the SterlingPro SS Double Wall Cafetiere as our favorite stainless-steel french press. Its lightweight, double-wall design provides amazing insulation, keeping the coffee hot and the exterior cool to the touch. The press also features a large capacity, holding a whopping six cups of coffee (where the average is about four).$37 at Amazon9. A stellar cold brew makerThe Takeya cold brew coffee maker is inexpensive and simple to use.Cold brew coffee is all the rage at local and chain coffee shops alike. It's basically an extra-strength cup of iced coffee that offers less bitterness, while still maintaining tons of flavor. The downside: buying it out all the time is an expensive habit. You can save some serious dough by making your own cold brew right at home. All it takes is steeping coffee grinds in cold or room temperature water for an extended period of time and you've got a smooth, powerful brew.Our favorite device to make cold brew is the Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Maker. We tested it against several other models on the market and found it to be easy to use, easy to clean (it's dishwasher safe!) and it yielded around four servings of perfectly balanced coffee—not too acidic nor watered down. Not to mention, it won't break the bank and will save you money in the long run.$28 at Amazon10. A reliable mug for homeThere are many beautiful mugs to choose from when drinking your coffee at home.When you’re sipping coffee from the comfort of your home, you want a mug that’s both convenient and allows you to appreciate your drink as you take in the flavor. For this, we recommend adding the Bodum Bistro Coffee Mug to your cupboard. It’s one of the best coffee mugs for home use as its insulation helps keep your drink warm longer. The Bodum Bistro mug is most notable for its transparent glass, which allows you to easily tell how much is left.If you’re looking for the mug of the future, then look no further than the Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug. It maintains your coffee’s perfect temperature and alerts you when your drink is ready to sip.$38 at Amazon$144 at Amazon11. A solid travel mugThe Zojirushi travel mug is an absolute beast when it comes to keeping your drinks nice and hot.Drinking your cup o’ joe on the go? You’ll want a travel mug that's easy to carry, simple to store and, most importantly, keeps your coffee piping hot as long as possible.After testing a variety of travel mugs, judging mugs on heat retention and spill-proof mechanisms, the 16 oz. Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug rose to the occasion. When it comes to retaining temperature, it does an incredible job—it actually rose in temperature by 6 degrees over half an hour. If you need a new go-to travel mug, consider this your best option.$30 at AmazonThere’s a lot more where this came from.

KR, which operates in the thin-margin grocery industry, has been undergoing a complete makeover with respect to products and how consumers prefer shopping.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Vertex Pharmaceuticals share price has climbed 92% in five years, easily topping the market return of 40% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 60%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Vertex Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 64% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 14% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 60% in the last twelve months. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals   you should know about.Story continuesOf course Vertex Pharmaceuticals may not be the best stock to buy.

The gene therapy has been developed in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP.The BLA will seek FDA’s approval for exa-cel to treat sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”). Vertex expects to start the rolling review this November and intends to complete the same by the end of first-quarter 2023.The filing with the FDA will be supported by data from two ongoing phase I/II/III studies – CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 – evaluating exa-cel in patients aged 12 through 35 with TDT and SCD indications, respectively. Both studies have completed enrolling patients.Earlier in June, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics announced updated data from the exa-cel studies, which showed that the therapy could be a one-time functional cure for SCD and TDT.Shares of Vertex have gained 29.7% in the year so far against the industry’s 28.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have also initiated two new phase III studies evaluating exa-cel in pediatric patients with TDT and SCD.Vertex has already completed discussions on exa-cel for both SCD and TDT indications with European regulatory authorities. Based on these discussions, management intends to submit the regulatory filings in the European Union and the United Kingdom by this year’s end.SCD and TDT indications have a significant unmet medical need. If successfully developed and commercialized, exa-cel can help Vertex Pharmaceuticals diversify its portfolio of marketed drugs that are currently focused on treating cystic fibrosis (CF). If approved, exa-cel will be Vertex’s first non-CF product and CRISPR Therapeutics’ first marketed product.While Vertex’s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline across six disease areas beyond CF like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD) and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Vertex is also looking for early-stage companies and products or intellectual property acquisitions that could help it broaden its pipeline beyond CF.Story continuesBoth Vertex and CRISPR entered into a collaboration agreement in 2015. Apart from exa-cel, both companies are working on developing therapies for cystic fibrosis as well as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1).Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated PriceVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderVertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Morphic MORF and Sanofi SNY.

(NYSE: WM) outperforming in such an environment.Waste Management – Company ProfileWaste Management, Inc provides waste management environmental services to customers in North America. It operates 260 landfills, 96 material recovery facilities (MRF), 5 secure hazardous waste landfills, and 340 transfer stations.The company is vertically integrated to handle everything from collection to disposal and runs 15,500 collection routes. Alongside Republic Services (NYSE: RSG), the company is the leader in the solid waste management sector, running half of the largest landfills in the US.In recent times, Waste Management grew through several acquisitions – the most prominent one being Advanced Disposal, for which the company paid US$4.9b in 2019. Currently, the company is set to acquire a controlling interest in Avangard Innovetive's US business, adding an estimated 400 million pounds per year of postconsumer resin and expanding its operation in the Midwest.Waste Management vs. Republic ServicesWaste is a co-product of any growth. Thus these 2 companies grew along with the economy. Although environmental pressures have been growing over the years, a growing economy finds it hard to reduce the amount of waste it produces. Instead, it has to improve its management, providing opportunities for specialized companies like those 2.Waste ManagementRepublic Services Net Profit Margin11.27%11.32% Growth Forecast9.6%7.5% Returns on Capital12%9.1% Debt/Equity176%126% Div. vs. Industry (1.4%)1.6%1.41%While their net profit margins are similar, both companies enjoy an advantage over the rest of the sector due to their moat and scale of operations. WM scores an advantage in the current growth forecast, as well as in higher returns on capital.Story continuesOperating in the capital-intensive industry, both companies carry considerable debt, but it seems it doesn't hinder their growth so far. Scratching below the surface, we see that WM looks ahead with better cash flow coverage (33.1% vs. 24.5%) and better EBIT coverage (9.1x vs. 6.9x).  WM vs RSG Valuation September 29, 2022  Both companies are paying a dividend that isn't notable, but it is higher than average in this sector. These dividends are growing steadily and have a modest payout ratio.Valuation – The Elephant in the RoomWarren Buffett famously said, „Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.“ According to him, the greatest danger might not be buying a company with poor prospects but rather overpaying for a company with good prospects.Both companies trade at a significant premium to the industry and broad market in general. Their valuation is at the point where it seems like its relative advantage in the ongoing market condition is priced in. Although our discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis points to some upside, WM still has a high price sticker – albeit at a better relative value to its biggest competitor, RSG.If you're unsure about the strength of Waste Management's business, you might want to explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

The new system incorporates a redesigned, state-of-the-art camera, providing new optical tracking options, combined with sophisticated algorithms of the newly launched Spine Guidance Software. The new guidance system will help in delivering more surgical planning and navigation capability than ever before.The Q Guidance System used with the Spine Guidance Software is likely to enable open or percutaneous computer-assisted surgery. The system received FDA approval for use in pediatric patients aged 13 and older in May.The launch of Q Guidance System is expected to significantly solidify Stryker’s foothold in the global orthopedics and spine space.Significance of Q Guidance’s LaunchStryker’s Q Guidance System is expected to deliver surgical spine planning and navigation capability via multiple tracking options, sophisticated software algorithms and smart instrumentation. The Q Guidance System has been designed in such a way that when used with the Airo TruCT mobile CT scanner, this ecosystem can deliver automatic image registration. It can also pair high-performance tracking capabilities with advanced intraoperative image quality and scan volume.Per management, the adaptability of the Q Guidance System is expected to aid the company in simplifying its technologies throughout multiple specialties like cranial, spine, ENT and orthopedics. Management also believes the system is for future compatibility with a fully integrated ecosystem, driving more value for Stryker’s customers.Stryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation PriceStryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation QuoteThe director of spine surgery at Nicklaus Children's Hospital has a strong faith in the new system as he expects it to provide reliable and scalable performance to a wide array of surgical procedures, ranging from a single-level fusion to a multi-level deformity correction.Story continuesRecent Notable DevelopmentsEarlier this month, Stryker received approval from the FDA for its OptaBlate bone tumor ablation system.

But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB), since the last five years saw the share price fall 27%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 17% in the last three months.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, LyondellBasell Industries actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 13% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.We note that the dividend has remained healthy, so that wouldn't really explain the share price drop. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling LyondellBasell Industries stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for LyondellBasell Industries the TSR over the last 5 years was -3.0%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that LyondellBasell Industries shares lost 16% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 21%. Given the total loss of 0.6% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand LyondellBasell Industries better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with LyondellBasell Industries (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

358,1cc11db9-12c8-380e-baa3-9d00915ff38f,VMC,2022-09-29,Are Investors Undervaluing Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) By 30%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-vulcan-materials-company-160259809.html,1664380979,STORY,['VMC'],"[Does the September share price for Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$793.3mUS$882.0mUS$945.5mUS$1.07bUS$1.15bUS$1.21bUS$1.27bUS$1.31bUS$1.36bUS$1.40bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.32%Est @ 5.71%Est @ 4.58%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.23%Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.8% US$749US$787US$797US$851US$863US$862US$852US$835US$814US$791(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.2bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (5.8%– 1.9%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 5.8%)10= US$21bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$29b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$152, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vulcan Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.920. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

This has lagged the Conglomerates sector's loss of 10.93% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.93% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from General Electric as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, General Electric is projected to report earnings of $0.51 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 10.53%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $19.04 billion, up 3.29% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.74 per share and revenue of $75.89 billion. These totals would mark changes of +29.25% and +2.38%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for General Electric should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

This is expected to be October 14, 2022. On that day, UnitedHealth Group is projected to report earnings of $5.45 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20.58%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $80.72 billion, up 11.59% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $21.86 per share and revenue of $322.21 billion, which would represent changes of +14.93% and +12.04%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for UnitedHealth Group.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is LKQ (LKQ). LKQ is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 11.36, while its industry has an average P/E of 11.57. Over the past year, LKQ's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.38 and as low as 10.62, with a median of 13.07.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is LKQ's P/B ratio of 2.30. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.56. Over the past year, LKQ's P/B has been as high as 3.02 and as low as 2.14, with a median of 2.59.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. LKQ has a P/S ratio of 0.98. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.02.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that LKQ has a P/CF ratio of 8.91. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 9.22. Over the past 52 weeks, LKQ's P/CF has been as high as 13.24 and as low as 8.91, with a median of 10.57.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that LKQ is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, LKQ sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

367,df39cf40-f5e6-3f9c-83fd-b353d5cdf8dc,LKQ,2022-09-29,Buying Opportunities in the Auto Sector as Volatility Surges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buying-opportunities-auto-sector-volatility-133301456.html,1664371981,STORY,"['LKQ', 'BWA']","[Volatility has become the byword for the stock market this year. After enduring a tough first half, the U.S. markets breathed a sigh of relief from the big summer rally that started in mid-June and continued till mid-August. But the rally petered out in the second half of August. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s resolute stance at the Jackson Hole conference that he won’t back off in the fight against inflation even if it results in economic pain didn’t go down too well with investors.The stock market slump accelerated last week when Powell raised interest rates by another 75 bps. This marked the third consecutive rate hike of 0.75% and pushed the benchmark interest rate to 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. The central bank also signaled that additional large rate hikes were likely at upcoming meetings as it combats inflation that remains near a 40-year high.Fed officials now expect the federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a full percentage point above the 3.25% to 3.5% projected in June to end 2022. This means that the central bank could approve another 75-bps hike in November and then a 50-bps hike in December. Economists have warned that the rapid monetary tightening policy could push the economy into recession.Not surprisingly, stocks continue to tumble as Wall Street ramps up selling in response to heightened fears about slowing economic growth. On Monday, S&amp;P 500 carved out a new 2022 low as investors wrestle with aggressive rate hikes, stubborn inflation, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, exacerbated supply chains and a possibility of a recession. The index sank deeper into the bear market yesterday, touching a two-year low.In such turbulent times, cyclical sectors suffer more. One such sector is the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The sector currently carries a Zacks Rank #13, which places it in the bottom 19% of the 16 Zacks sectors. Over the past month, the auto sector has declined around 8%. Amid economic uncertainty, the auto sector’s prospects look muted. So, should investors completely avoid auto stocks? No, instead they should take the opportunity of the current dip and start accumulating stocks that are trading at a discount. Rush Enterprises, Inc. RUSHA, BorgWarner, Inc. BWA and LKQ Corp LKQ are a few such beaten-down auto stocks.Story continuesAuto Market Stares at a Bumpy Road AheadThe demand for vehicles has held strong so far but the auto market is highly sensitive to economic cycles. Consumers spend more on big-ticket items when they have higher disposable income. When income is tight, discretionary expenses are the first to be slashed. Considering the current economic slowdown, the demand for vehicles might just start cooling off.We know that the auto industry is currently struggling with chip shortage, which has put a lid on supply. Amid the demand and supply mismatch, currently, the inventory is low and average prices of vehicles are on the rise. While consumers have been willing to pay a premium for their preferred vehicles till now, but for how long? The rising interest rates are increasing the financing costs of vehicles. With borrowing getting expensive and threats of a recession looming large, consumers might be unwilling to pay a heavy premium for cars and demand may gradually soften. As demand abates, auto retailers may choose to slash prices to compete for customers, which could dent their bottom line. As all the major U.S. indices are in a bear market, auto stocks are being severely hit.Now is the Time to Buy for Long-Term GainsInstead of mourning over the market’s bloodbath, savvy investors should see this as a buying opportunity. An extended downturn may unnerve some investors prompting them to stay away from the buy-the-dip strategy. Indeed, there’s no guarantee that you will get the stocks at rock-bottom prices, but you shouldn’t back off from this popular investing approach.Just keep a long-term investment horizon. You will surely fetch profits when the cycle changes. Even if you think that it’s too early to resort to a buy-on-the-dip approach, don’t wait for a better entry point now. Don’t try to predict the bottom of the stock market. Even, the brightest minds on Wall Street couldn’t. Instead, take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Just keep buying the dips amid the correction if you are ready to keep your money in the markets for at least three to five years.3 Auto BetsWe have narrowed our search to three stocks currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs.

(NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-automatic-data-140104286.html,1664373664,STORY,['ADP'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing Is Automatic Data Processing Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.09%Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.22% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (6.2%– 1.9%) = US$143bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$143b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$78bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$117b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$228, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.010. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by both growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Story continuesUsing the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

377,247d2266-b525-36b5-931d-c0c85c028b2f,DHI,2022-09-29,Here's Why Investors Should Steer Clear of MDC Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-steer-clear-183406887.html,1664390046,STORY,"['DHI', 'MDC', 'LEN-B', 'KBH']","[M.D.C. Holdings, Inc.’s MDC shares plunged 50.5% this year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 38.5% decline. The overall industry has been grappling with supply chain disruptions and labor and raw material shortages. Also, rising inflation, particularly for materials and transportation, the Fed’s interest rate hikes and affordability issues are adding to the woes.Although MDC and its peers like KB Home KBH, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI and Lennar Corporation LEN have undertaken various price actions as well as cost-saving moves, they are witnessing reduced demand and project delays.Analysts are pessimistic about MDC’ near-term prospects, as evident from the recent estimate revision trend. Earnings estimates for the third quarter and 2022 have fallen in the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has decreased 6.3% and 4.5% for both the said periods, respectively. This reflects 12.6% earnings growth on just an 8% revenue rise for third quarter. For 2022, earnings estimates reflect 17.6% improvement on 8.2% revenue increase. For 2023, the situation is likely to worsen, as evident from 27.7% earnings decline over 2022 for a 7.3% revenue decrease.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s check out the factors insisting investors to sell MDC — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) — stocks now. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Makes MDC a Sell Rated Stock?Fed’s Back-to-Back Interest Rate Hikes to Deal InflationThe housing industry is cyclical and affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Currently, the Fed's determination to curtail inflation through interest rate increases and quantitative tightening has started to show the desired effect of slowing down sales in some markets across the country.In September, the Fed approved its third consecutive interest-rate rise of 0.75 percentage points and signaled additional large increases were likely at upcoming meetings as it combats inflation that remains near a 40-year high. The rate hike brings the central bank’s benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, to a new range of 3.0% to 3.25% — its highest level since 2008 — from a range between 2.25% and 2.5%. Officials expect the Fed funds rate to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2022 and 4.6% by the end of 2023. Hence, it increased by 3.4% for this year and 3.8% previously.Story continuesAbove 6% Mortgage Rates Hurt Buyers IntentionThe highly interest-rate-sensitive housing sector in the United States has been significantly impacted by the rising mortgage rates as the Fed made an aggressive move to bring down the high inflation by lifting borrowing costs. Interest rate hikes, soaring inflation and a smaller bond-buying program are hitting the affordability of the prospective buyers.The recent Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey shows that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has gone up to 6.29% for the week ending Sep 22. This marks the highest reading since 2008 and more than double the year-ago figure. Mortgage activity declined 3.7% for the week ending Sep 23 from the previous week, per the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey.Low Orders, Deliveries &amp; BacklogsDue to lower demand from higher mortgage interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, MDC experienced a year-over-year decline in deliveries and net orders during the second quarter.Units delivered were down 7% from the year-ago level to 2,536 homes. Net new orders fell 29% from the prior-year quarter to 2,237 homes. The value of net orders also declined 40% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $882.1 million, despite a 16% higher ASP of net orders. Cancellations, as a percentage of beginning backlog, increased 400 basis points to 9.7% from 5.7%.Quarter-end backlog totaled 7,426 homes, down 3% from a year ago. Potential housing revenues from backlog rose 8% from the prior-year period’s levels to $4.44 billion on a 12% higher ASP of homes in backlog.For third-quarter 2022, the company expects home deliveries of between 2,200 and 2,500 units. This indicates a decline from 2,419 units reported in third-quarter 2021 (considering the mid-point of the guidance).Supply-Chain Bottlenecks &amp; InflationMDC has been witnessing challenges related to supply chain issues, material shortages and municipal delays. Raw material inflation is eating into homebuilders’ margins. Labor shortages are resulting in higher wages and delays in construction, which eventually hurts the number of homes delivered. In addition, the rising lumber prices could dampen housing market momentum. There is a lot of variability in lumber prices that are building cost pressure. The increase was mainly due to insufficient domestic production and tariffs on Canadian sources.A Brief Discussion of Above-Mentioned StocksKB Home, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company, recently reported mixed results in third-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended Aug 31, 2022), with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same.On a year-over-year basis, KBH’s earnings and revenues increased, despite prevailing industry headwinds and moderate housing demand, given the solid backlog level.D.R. Horton, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock, is expected to witness a 41.4% year-over-year improvement in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Also, revenues are likely to gain 25.9% from the prior-year levels.However, DHI’s earnings per share are expected to register a 20.7% decline in fiscal 2023 after the expected 49.7% growth in fiscal 2022.Lennar, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, also reported its third-quarter fiscal 2022 (ended May 31, 2022) results, wherein quarterly earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same amid rising interest rates.Pertaining to the quarterly release, Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Lennar, said, ""While our new orders declined 12% compared to last year's third quarter, we continued to maintain a consistent starts pace and drive sales by adjusting pricing and incentives. Sales have clearly been impacted by rising interest rates, but there remains a significant national shortage of housing, especially workforce housing, and demand remains strong as we navigate the rebalance between price and interest rates.""Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 15.8% annual rise in July, down from the 18.1% growth rate registered in June. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller House Price Index fell 0.4% month over month in July for the first time in 10 years.A Rebound for U.S. Housing?The solid sales pace in August most likely depicts buyers’ willingness to capitalize on price cuts by builders as well as to purchase a home before there are further increases in borrowing costs.The Fed's determination to curtail inflation through interest rate increases and quantitative tightening has started to show the desired effect of slowing down sales in markets across the country. In September 2022, the Fed approved its third consecutive interest rate rise of 0.75 percentage points and signaled that additional large increases are likely at the upcoming meetings to combat 40-year-high inflation.The rate hike takes the central bank’s benchmark interest rate — the federal funds rate — to a new range of 3.0% to 3.25% — its highest level since 2008 — from between 2.25% and 2.5%. Officials expect the Fed funds rate to rise to 4.4% by the end of 2022 and 4.6% by the end of 2023. Hence, it is up from 3.4% for this year and 3.8% previously.Consequently, the highly interest-rate-sensitive housing sector in the United States has been significantly impacted by rising mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.29% last week, the highest since October 2008 compared with 6.02% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.In the year-ago period, the mortgage rate averaged 2.88%. With the rapid acceleration of mortgage rates, home-price appreciation began to cool off as housing demand is slowing down.Overall, August data for U.S. housing remains mixed. Building permits — a key indicator in projecting future housing starts — to build new houses slumped in August. Building permits dropped 10% from July to the lowest level in two years. Nonetheless, housing starts unexpectedly rose by over 12% and were down 0.1% from a year ago, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.This latest growth in new housing starts is encouraging for the housing market as inventory remains tight. The shortage in supply has played a key role in pushing home prices higher.Then again, with the risk of further rise in borrowing costs — as Fed policymakers are considering more hikes to combat rapid inflation — the U.S. housing market will most likely face the consequences.Homebuilders also remained concerned as depicted in the latest National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo’s Housing Market Index (HMI). Sentiment among U.S. homebuilders for newly-built, single-family homes slipped to the lowest level since May 2020 in September 2022.Story continuesHowever, barring the readings for April and May 2020 (when HMI fell to 30 and 37, respectively), the September 2022 reading of 46 marks the lowest level since May 2014. High home prices, above 6% mortgage rates and back-to-back interest rate hikes make it difficult for entry-level and first-time buyers to indulge in such activity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index and broader Zacks Construction sector year to date.

For a deeper dive, a rare appearance by Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith in the 11 o'clock. We had day one yesterday.BRAD SMITH: Yes.AKIKO FUJITA: How does this set things up?BRAD SMITH: All right, so basically, what the US Department of Justice is going to try and argue here, as well as the other six states and the District of Columbia, they're going to try and argue that this essentially is a violation of some of the very basic rules of what the FTC Act was setting out almost 100 years ago, a little more than 100 years ago. And it's really going to look at kind of these two checks to make sure that they weren't actually crossed, those boundaries crossed.And one of them is a consumer protection, very basic to make sure that you're not stripping out the open market competition. And in this case, the Northeastern Alliance actually allows for these two airline operators to take about 80% market share of routes that go between Boston and Washington and some other major hubs as well.And so with that in mind, you've got a critical implication here because for JetBlue and American, they're both battling for themselves the need to actually look across their capacity, know where they're going to be able to counter some of the either pilot shortages or staffing issues, as well as some of the higher fuel costs that they've both cited in their most recent earnings.However, even when you have reduced capacity because of the demand, you have higher revenues that they're able to take in at this point in time. So the US Department of Justice is basically looking into that right now, but it could have larger implications, too, for an acquisition that Spirit and JetBlue have entered into and has been approved by shareholders as well.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, so let's talk about that because one of the concerns around that acquisition was that they already have this alliance, and this will only hinder competition.BRAD SMITH: Right.AKIKO FUJITA: What are the implications?BRAD SMITH: And so it's really looking at the low cost part of the broader airline equation here. And so this was a 33 and-- well, $33.50 a share acquisition that was approved by shareholders, plus some other incentives. But now it comes down to what the FTC is actually going to take away from this legal proceeding that's taking place right now, what they can take away from that and extrapolate, and whether or not it becomes a more extensive or scrutiny-based type of approach to that review process between the Spirit and JetBlue deal that is going forward to this point in time, expected to close in 2024 at this point.AKIKO FUJITA: One of the reasons why there are so many eyes on this particular case. Brad, appreciate you breaking that down for us.]"

""Outside of the NEA, we are full-blooded competitors,"" he testified before Judge Leo Sorokin, who will decide the case.Hayes said JetBlue had been interested in joining the alliance to fend off competition from Delta Air Lines in Boston and to expand in congested New York area airports.For example, he said, JetBlue had 150 or 160 departures a day at JFK before the alliance but is now up to about 200, using what had been American slots.""We entered the Northeast Alliance because it will allow JetBlue to accelerate our business model in the northeast,"" he said, adding that JetBlue, which has a reputation in the industry of being a disruptor, had no plans to change.JetBlue also has a plan in place to buy low cost rival Spirit SAVE.N, a deal that is expected to face a tough antitrust review.Airline mergers in recent years have led to a highly consolidated industry, in which American, Delta, United and Southwest Airlines control over 80% of domestic travel, the government has said.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

During the year, she looks forward to family traditions around holidays including Día de los Muertos. And at work, Lopez finds community with coworkers who switch from English to Spanish as easily as she does, as well as the Principal® Hispanic/Latino Employee Resource Group (HLERG).Principal Financial Group, Wednesday, September 28, 2022, Press release picture""My colleagues are very supportive, and I've been fortunate to have roles where I have been able to put my bilingual skills to good use,"" Lopez says, who is a client service specialist in operational support at Principal.That support enabled Lopez to provide critical assistance at the onset of the pandemic when customers-some of them native Spanish speakers and many of them worried about the economy-called in with questions about their retirement accounts. ""It helped for them to have someone they could understand without a translator,"" Lopez says, who is bilingual and at the time was a retirement specialist. ""I really enjoyed helping my community and making a difference.""National Hispanic Heritage Month began in 1968 as a weeklong celebration. Twenty years later, it was extended to a month-September 15 through October 15-to celebrate the history, culture, and contributions by citizens of the United States with ancestors from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. This year's theme is ""Unidos: Inclusivity for a Stronger Nation.""Why mid-month? Within those 30 days are several countries' independence anniversaries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Chile.Guadalupe's experiences-celebrating her heritage and traditions at home and work while providing specific insight to help Hispanic and Latino Americans-provide an example of how to strengthen inclusive connections, and not just during Hispanic Heritage Month.Service for OthersEveryone works toward financial goals differently, depending on multiple influences including education, trust, comfort, and access, to name just a few. And not every community approaches current and future financial goals the same.Story continuesFor example, less than six out of 10 members of the Hispanic/Latino community find it achievable to manage income and expenses, according to the 2022 Principal® Retirement Security Survey. Only 69% of Hispanic people say it's easy to access a bank account, compared to 85% of those who are white. The survey also found that members of Hispanic communities are less likely to think they'll be able to get a job and pay taxes.When Diego Verdugo was 10, he and his family moved from a border town in Mexico to Douglas, Arizona. He was the first in his family to go to and graduate from college, and learned a valuable lesson: Education opened doors for him.When Verdugo joined Principal in 2012 as part of the leadership development program, he was able to help develop a 401(k) education program specifically for Hispanics. ""I got to leverage my background and skill set, and train people who were running the meetings,"" Verdugo says, who is now director with Principal Global Investors.Spanish speakers can find financial literacy and wellness information from Principal through:Principal® Hola Futuro, our financial wellness education hubThe Principal® app in Spanish, with 24/7 retirement account accessA Principal employer hub with resources geared specifically toward Hispanic employeesEven then, he knew he could do more. ""I asked if I could start conducting those 401(k) education meetings myself in Spanish and English,"" he says. ""Historically when companies thought about how to amplify bicultural and bilingual talent, one of the only doors open was through call centers. But now, our skills, backgrounds, and expertise are being maximized as we continue serving our customers, the employee population, and our community.""Offering EducationVerdugo has been part of the HLERG leadership team and steering committee since its inception. For him and employees like Lopez, the monthly meetings offer education, support, and professional development as well as an opportunity to celebrate moments like Hispanic Heritage Month.For example, Lopez's family, who are originally from Oaxaca, Mexico, have different food, traditions, values, and cultural experiences than someone from any other country in Latin America. ""Events like Hispanic Heritage Month really help to educate others on those differences,"" she says.Mark your calendars for Hispanic/Latino celebrations supported by Principal and Principal® Foundation.Hispanic Heritage MonthLatino Heritage Festival, September 24-25, sponsored by Principal FoundationDía de los Muertos, November 3The HLERG leadership also maintains intentional connections to other Principal ERGs and enterprise-wide initiatives, says Verdugo, such as a speaker series. ""We don't want to create silos,"" Verdugo says. ""We ask ourselves how we can take resources that might be concentrated in Des Moines and make them available to all employees-even overseas. We want to create strong communities for everyone.""For Verdugo, involvement in HLERG has led him to opportunities with other organizations, such as the Association of Latino Professionals For America (ALPFA). He co-leads the Phoenix chapter where he's now based; it received the 2022 Developing Chapter of the Year award. ""Principal has always supported my work in ALPFA and sponsored four employees to go to the national convention,"" Verdugo says. ""It's our way of taking what we do here for our employees and communities and expanding it for the national platform.""For Verdugo, it's also more than that. When he was in college, he was the recipient of a Principal scholarship-his first connection to the company. ""Serving my community has always been a personal responsibility because a lot of people helped me along the way, so it's a way of me paying back and paying forward,"" Verdugo says. ""I am able to tell that story in our walls and outside of our walls, and if more Latinos knew the Principal story, more could relate to it. We have the same ideals and same values of helping people live their best life.""Did you know?Latin America refers to is a region, not a continent or country.

This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those looking to beef up their portfolio’s defense, let’s dive deeper into each one.The Hershey CompanyThe Hershey Company is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.Over the last few months, analysts have upped their bottom-line outlook marginally across several timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHSY carries strong dividend metrics – the company has upped its dividend payout five times over the last five years, paired with a robust 7.4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Hershey’s 1.9% annual dividend yield comes in under its Zacks sector average of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, it’s hard to ignore the company’s projected growth; earnings are forecasted to climb a double-digit 14.4% in FY22 and a further 9% in FY23.HSY’s displaying remarkable top-line strength as well, with revenue forecasted to increase 14% and 6% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCoPepsiCo is a long-established company engaged in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. We see their snacks and drinks at seemingly every stop.Analysts have raised their earnings outlook marginally across several timeframes over the last several months, undoubtedly a positive.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt's been a very positive 2022 for PepsiCo, which recently joined the elite Dividend King group, demonstrating an exceptional commitment to shareholders through 50 consecutive years of increased dividend payouts.PEP’s annual dividend sits at a respectable 2.8%, marginally below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average of 2.9%.Still, the company’s 6.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly the major highlight.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, PEP carries a favorable growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 6.4% and 8.5% in FY22 and FY23, respectively.Top-line growth is also very apparent; revenue looks to climb nearly 6% in FY22 and a further 3.6% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConstellation BrandsConstellation Brands produces and markets beer, wine, and spirits, claiming the spot of the third-largest beer company and a leading, high-end wine company in the United States. A few of its brands include Corona, Modelo, and SVEDKA Vodka.Earnings estimates have gone up across the board over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike PEP and HSY, Constellation Brands sports a robust growth profile; the company’s bottom-line is projected to expand 8.7% in FY23 and a further double-digit 15% in FY24.Revenue growth is also impressive, with estimates calling for 7.5% top-line growth in FY23 and 7% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, STZ rewards its shareholders via its annual dividend yielding a respectable 1.4%, below its Zacks sector average.Still, what the company lacks in yield is made up with its dividend growth – STZ has upped its dividend payout four times over the last five years, paired with a strong 6.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInjecting defensive stocks into portfolios in 2022 has undoubtedly been a great idea, seen as a way to combat a hawkish Federal Reserve that’s spoiled the fun for technology and other high-growth stocks.All in all, it comes down to this – companies in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector know how to make money in all environments, even under a dark fiscal cloud.All three stocks above – PepsiCo PEP, Constellation Brands STZ, and The Hershey Company HSY – carry a favorable Zacks Rank, telling us that analysts have confidence in their near-term earnings performance.Further, all three stocks pay investors handsomely, undoubtedly a significant perk that all investors love.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Consumer Staples Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001758.html,1664370001,STORY,"['MBLY', 'TSLA']","[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Mobileye Global (MBLY) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.15 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 27, 2023.Mobileye Global's Earnings ESP sits at 11.94%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13.MBLY is part of a big group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tesla (TSLA) as well.Tesla, which is readying to report earnings on April 19, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.86 a share, and TSLA is 12 days out from its next earnings report.Tesla's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.22% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MBLY and TSLA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval, Dupixent becomes the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the U.S. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review, which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.""Patients living with prurigo nodularis must often contend with dozens, if not hundreds, of itchy and painful nodules covering their body and have not had an approved treatment option for their disease,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent has already transformed the treatment landscape of several diseases driven by type 2 inflammation – including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and eosinophilic esophagitis – and been prescribed to more than half a million patients around the world for its approved indications. With this approval, those suffering with prurigo nodularis finally have a medicine to address the debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease.""Story continues""Until today, there were limited treatment options to manage the relentless itch and associated sensations of burning and stinging skin that can negatively impact the lives of patients struggling with prurigo nodularis,"" said Naimish Patel, M.D, Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for prurigo nodularis patients by alleviating the key hallmarks of the disease, such as reducing itch and achieving clearer skin. With Dupixent now approved in two diseases in dermatology where type 2 inflammation is a central driver, we look forward to further evaluating the potential of inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 in other chronic skin diseases.""The FDA approval is based on data from two Phase 3 trials, PRIME and PRIME2, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch, clearing of skin, or both:About three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 24 weeks, compared to 18% and 20% for placebo, the primary endpoint in PRIME44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at 12 weeks, compared to 16% and 22% for placebo, the primary endpoint in PRIME2More than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks, compared to 18% and 16% for placeboMore than three times as many Dupixent patients (39% and 32%) experienced both a clinically meaningful reduction in itch and clear or almost clear skin, compared to 9% and 9% of placebo patients at 24 weeksThe safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indication. The most common adverse events (≥2%) from pooled PRIME and PRIME2 data more frequently observed with Dupixent than placebo were nasopharyngitis (5% Dupixent, 2% placebo), conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent, 1% placebo), herpes infection (3% Dupixent, 0% placebo), dizziness (3% Dupixent, 1% placebo), muscle pain (3% Dupixent, 1% placebo), and diarrhea (3% Dupixent, 1% placebo).A regulatory filing for prurigo nodularis is under review by the European Medicines Agency, and submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned in 2022.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful, with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. There are about 75,000 adults in the U.S. living with prurigo nodularis and are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis.In PRIME and PRIME2, the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks, respectively. Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale), and the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S.About DupixentDupixent is administered as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 18 years and older with prurigo nodularis, Dupixent 300 mg is administered with a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen every two weeks following an initial loading dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Regeneron and Sanofi are committed to helping patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Dupixent gain access to the medicine and receive the support they may need with the DUPIXENT MyWay® program. For more information, please call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936) or visit www.DUPIXENT.com.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved across these indications in the U.S. and for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in the European Union and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent such as prurigo nodularis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP and EoE.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritis of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION &amp; INDICATIONSDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you:have eye problems.have a parasitic (helminth) infection.are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.

Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words ""expects"", ""anticipates"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""estimates"", ""plans"" and similar expressions. Although Sanofi's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, unexpected regulatory actions or delays, or government regulation generally, that could affect the availability or commercial potential of the product, the fact that product may not be commercially successful, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including future clinical data and analysis of existing clinical data relating to the product, including post marketing, unexpected safety, quality or manufacturing issues, competition in general, risks associated with intellectual property and any related future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation, and volatile economic and market conditions, and the impact that COVID-19 will have on us, our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, and the financial condition of any one of them, as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" in Sanofi's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Quest Diagnostics' shares on or after the 3rd of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 19th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.66 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.64 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Quest Diagnostics stock has a trailing yield of around 2.2% on the current share price of $122.31. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Quest Diagnostics's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Quest Diagnostics has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 21% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Quest Diagnostics generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 20% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Quest Diagnostics has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Quest Diagnostics looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Quest Diagnostics has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Quest Diagnostics worth buying for its dividend? We love that Quest Diagnostics is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Quest Diagnostics, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.In light of that, while Quest Diagnostics has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Quest Diagnostics that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.
