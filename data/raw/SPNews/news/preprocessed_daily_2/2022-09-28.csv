But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) share price is up 90% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 22% (not including dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Charles Schwab While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Charles Schwab achieved compound earnings per share growth of 4.7% per year. In comparison, the 24% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Charles Schwab's TSR for the last 3 years was 98%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Charles Schwab returned a loss of 5.0% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company has a dull earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the preceding four quarters while missing in the other three.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Enerpac Tool’s fiscal fourth quarter.Enerpac Tool Group Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseEnerpac Tool Group Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseEnerpac Tool Group Corp. price-eps-surprise | Enerpac Tool Group Corp. QuoteFactors to NoteRecovery in the oil &amp; gas end market due to increasing oil prices is expected to have aided Enerpac Tool’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. Cost-reduction initiatives and pricing actions are likely to have supported the company’s margin performance.However, supply chain and logistics challenges as well as raw material and manufacturing cost inflation might have impacted EPAC’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Given the company’s substantial international exposure, foreign currency headwinds are likely to have weighed on the top line.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Enerpac Tool this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.

The bottom line decreased 42.6% from the year-ago quarter on higher costs and expenses. While total revenues of $151.9 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million, it increased 6.1% year over year due to healthy segmental performances.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Lindsay Corporation LNN has an Earnings ESP of +5.99% and a Zacks Rank #2.

6,eac31bc0-158d-3d31-b31e-7b05dbc410f5,AYI,2022-09-28,Acuity Brands (AYI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-brands-ayi-reports-next-140002028.html,1664287202,STORY,['AYI'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Acuity Brands (AYI) reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis lighting maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.11 billion, up 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Acuity Brands?For Acuity Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Acuity Brands will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Acuity Brands would post earnings of $2.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.52, delivering a surprise of +18.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Acuity Brands appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unum (UNM) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Finance peers, we might be able to answer that question.Unum is one of 883 companies in the Finance group. The Finance group currently sits at #3 within the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different groups, measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the sector to gauge the strength of each group.The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Unum is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNM's full-year earnings has moved 18.1% higher within the past quarter. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.Based on the latest available data, UNM has gained about 56.5% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Finance group have lost about 20.8% on average. This shows that Unum is outperforming its peers so far this year.Another stock in the Finance sector, First Business Financial Services (FBIZ), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 13.5%.In First Business Financial Services' case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 14.7% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Breaking things down more, Unum is a member of the Insurance - Accident and Health industry, which includes 5 individual companies and currently sits at #17 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has lost an average of 0.8% so far this year, so UNM is performing better in this area.Story continuesIn contrast, First Business Financial Services falls under the Banks - Midwest industry. Currently, this industry has 29 stocks and is ranked #19. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved -8.1%.Unum and First Business Financial Services could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Finance stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock’s valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Dillard's Inc. DDS, United Rentals Inc. URI and Unum Group UNM.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Investors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.Story continuesWith respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAvis Budget Group provides car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. The ability of CAR to cater to a wide range of mobility demands helps it to expand and strengthen its global foothold through organic growth.Avis Budget Group operates through distinct global brands that focus on different market segments and complement other brands in their respective regional markets. Fleet expansion and technology enhancement efforts by CAR are likely to enhance its offerings. The forward P/E of Avis Budget Group for the current financial year is 3.4X, lower than the industry average of 14.8X. CAR has a PEG ratio of 0.2, lower than the industry average of 1.3. Avis Budget Group has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.The forward P/E of Marathon Petroleum for the current financial year is 4.7X, lower than the industry average of 6.2X. MPC has a PEG ratio of 0.3, lower than the industry average of 0.5. Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last 7 days.United Rentals is benefiting from the U.S. administration’s increased focus on infrastructural improvement. URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided United Rentals’ second-quarter 2022 results. During the period, rental revenues grew 26.2% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin expanded 360 basis points.The forward P/E of United Rentals for the current financial year is 9.2X, lower than the industry average of 12X. URI has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 1.0. United Rentals has an expected earnings growth rate of 43.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 6.8% over the last 60 days.Unum Group’s conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. The sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business lines and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience.Continued rollout of dental products and geographic expansion have been paying off for UNM as its acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders’ value. Unum Group expects 2022 premiums to grow about 2%. Adjusted operating EPS is expected to grow 15-20%.The forward P/E of Unum Group for the current financial year is 6.3X, lower than the industry average of 14.5X. UNM has a PEG ratio of 0.8 lower than the industry average of 1.4. Unum Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 7 days.Dillard's operates retail department stores in the southeast, southwest and Midwest areas of the United States. Its stores offer merchandise, including fashion apparel for women, men, and children as well as accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings, and other consumer goods.Dillard’s has been keen on inventory management since the start of the pandemic, through measures like cancellation, suspension and delaying of shipments as well as merchandise purchase reduction.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas How Fast Is Cintas Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Cintas has grown EPS by 14% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Not all of Cintas' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. EBIT margins for Cintas remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 10% to US$7.9b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Cintas' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Cintas Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$40b company like Cintas. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$5.9b. That equates to 15% of the company, making insiders powerful and aligned with other shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Cintas, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.Cintas offered total compensation worth US$7.8m to its CEO in the year to May 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Cintas Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Cintas is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Cintas, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Cintas  that you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Since he and others would never sell their teams, an advantageous supply-demand scenario is created for any potential seller.

""I'd done it in gas business. I had a little money, but what I wanted to do was coach football. I never thought that I could be involved in something that would have economic viability. The fact that it does ... and has for the last 30 years, beyond anything I could have ever imagined, is just a major plus. So I think there's a future of values that will exceed what Denver went for, for sure.""Another major value driver for the NFL is viewership. The league started 2022 with viewership numbers surpassing pre-pandemic levels.Story continuesPrior to the current season, the NFL signed a $1 billion deal with Amazon (AMZN) for the streamer to have exclusive rights for Thursday Night Football, with the first game airing on Sept. 22 between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.Jones described the experience as “epic.”“Frankly, the picture for the National Football League in the entire time I've been associated with it has never been better because of the continued interest,” he said.—Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Last year, it hired 10,000 seasonal workers during the event, which marked the highest in its history.  The holiday season is crucial for retailers as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Retailers try to attract customers with early-hour store openings, huge discounts and promotional strategies.The seasonal hires will not only receive attractive pay and an optional DailyPay but also gain from pre-requisites like up to 25% discount on store products. The employees will get the opportunity to gain experience by working with the best sports and outdoor brands.All stores and distribution centers will remain shut on Thanksgiving Day, but customers can shop online. Following this, all stores will re-open on Black Friday.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 32.2% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%.

Retailers are increasingly focused on strengthening supply chains to avoid disruptions, which have been deterrents for a while.We note that supermarket giant Walmart WMT is leaving no stone unturned to leverage the upcoming holiday season. Consequently, WMT unveiled plans to deploy 40,000 workers at more than 250 Walmart and Sam’s Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and transportation offices earlier this month.The new positions include seasonal store associates, customer service associates and 1,500 full-time truck drivers. Earlier, Walmart employed 150,000 associates during the 2021 holiday season.Macy’s M announced plans to recruit 41,000 associates ahead of the holiday shopping season. The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 48,000 seasonal associates for the 2021 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transit into permanent roles.Kroger KR recently unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. KR is likely to recruit 1,500 associates for full and part-time positions for their North Texas stores.Vacancies are available in all departments, including retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, supply chain, merchandising, logistics, corporate, pharmacy and healthcare. Kroger hired more than 20,000 associates through its nationwide hiring event for the 2021 holiday sale.We note that the overall year-over-year decline in holiday hiring can be attributable to sluggish consumer demand ahead of the holidays. Planned rate increases, inflation, potential recession and continued labor shortages remain concerning.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Players in the industry are all geared up to walk the extra mile this holiday season to capitalize on any surge in demand. However, supply-chain issues and rising freight charges are headwinds that the industry is currently struggling with, but retailers remain hopeful of a fabulous festive season.The holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues, is a make or break for retailers. Hence, retailers need to address any logistical or inventory issues and roll out strategies to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether offline or online. Keeping all these aspects in mind and to keep pace with any unprecedented increase in demand, retailers are unveiling hiring plans for the holiday season.Considering consumers’ product preferences, retailers need to replenish shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramp up investments in digitization. These will result in the deployment of a reasonable number of seasonal associates to deal with the curbside and in-store pickup of online purchases as well as doorstep delivery. Also, retailers are likely to appoint more warehouse staff to ensure the smooth supply of inventories to stores from distribution centers during the festive period.Retailers on a Hiring SpreeThe retail behemoth, Walmart WMT, plans to hire about 40,000 workers, including seasonal and full-time. The company will also offer additional hours to its existing workers. The job roles include seasonal store associates, full-time permanent truck drivers and customer care associates.Walmart is making solid price investments across key categories to offer great value to its customers. It is also offering more rollbacks to boost savings on gifts like toys, electronics, beauty and home, to name a few. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also making efforts to ease the returns process, as part of which it announced that Walmart+ members can avail of new return options, including Holiday Guarantee, Curbside Returns and Return Pickup from Home, starting October.Meanwhile, Target Corporation TGT plans to appoint up to 100,000 seasonal workers to better serve its guests and provide a seamless shopping experience.

Recruitment will be done at its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, supply-chain locations and call centers.Macy’s has undertaken initiatives to better engage with customers and gain market share. The company believes that the Polaris Strategy positions it well to navigate through the dynamic retail landscape.

It’s been nearly three years since the city allowed mainland tour groups, so it goes without saying that players are ready to get back.Three stocks that popped yesterday on the news include Las Vegas Sands LVS, Wynn Resorts WYNN, and MGM Resorts International MGM. Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, LVS shares have been notably strong, with MGM shares being the weakest.It raises a valid question: should investors try to tap into the resurgence of Macau? Let’s take a deeper look.Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts is a leading casino resort developer, owner, and operator. The company owns and operates casino hotel resort properties Wynn Macau and the Wynn Palace, located in the Special Administrative Region of Macau.Wynn also owns and operates casino hotel resort properties Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas.Investors took the news well; yesterday, shares closed up 12%.The announcement comes at a critical time – WYNN has struggled to exceed quarterly estimates, missing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in eight of its previous ten quarters.However, the company did pencil in a strong 12.8% bottom-line beat in its latest quarter, perhaps indicating that the tide could be turning.Revenue results have also been primarily disheartening, with Wynn Resorts exceeding top-line estimates in just three of its last ten prints.Story continuesStill, the company’s revenue appears to have recovered from the initial pandemic shock, as we can see in the chart below illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, WYNN shares carry a 1.9X forward price-to-sales ratio, nicely below its five-year median of 2.3X but representing a 12% premium relative to its Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector.Wynn Resorts carries a Style Score of a D for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLas Vegas SandsLas Vegas Sands is a leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts primarily operating in the U.S. and Asia. The company's Macau business comprises the following resorts: Sands Macau, Venetian Macau, Four Seasons Macau, and Parisian Macau.Las Vegas Sands shares were hot yesterday, closing up more than 11%.The pandemic restrictions have hit LVS hard; the company has missed the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven of its last ten quarters.Top-line results paint the same story, with Las Vegas Sands exceeding revenue estimates in just three of its last ten prints.However, similar to WYNN, it appears that the company’s revenue has recovered nicely from its 2020 lows, as we can see in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, LVS carries stretched valuation levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of an F for Value.The company’s 6.9X forward price-to-sales ratio is undoubtedly on the steep side, well above its five-year median of 4.4X and representing a rich 314% premium relative to its Zacks Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMGM Resorts International MGM Resorts International is a holding company that owns and operates casino resorts through wholly owned subsidiaries. MGM’s China operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino.MGM shares came out of the gate hot, touching a price of roughly $31.50 before tumbling and closing the day down a marginal 0.2%.MGM has a much stronger earnings track record, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in eight of its last ten quarters. Still, the gaming titan posted a wide 87% bottom-line miss in its latest report.Top-line results have been impressive; MGM has chained together seven consecutive revenue beats. In addition, MGM has a notably stronger revenue trend than WYNN and LVS, as we can see below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company sports a Style Score of an A, indicating that shares could be considered undervalued.MGM’s 0.9X forward price-to-sales ratio is nowhere near its 1.4X five-year median and reflects an attractive 36% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA curb on travel-related restrictions has put the gambling capital of the world, Macau, in the spotlight.After years of depressed foot traffic stemming from pandemic restrictions, consumers look to get back into the casinos, undoubtedly a positive for any company with exposure to the city.All three stocks above – Las Vegas Sands LVS, Wynn Resorts WYNN, and MGM Resorts International MGM – have operations in Macau.In addition, all three carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).All three would provide exposure for investors looking to tap into the cash that’ll soon be flowing in Macau.However, investors should approach the situation carefully.Many unknowns could occur in the coming months, especially with the lingering pandemic.A great approach would be waiting until positive earnings estimate revisions start rolling in.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This year's final quarter, however, could see operators hold production rates high to grab strong diesel margins, they said.The forecast excludes the potential impact of a major hurricane striking the U.S. Gulf Coast, home of nearly half the nation's oil refining. It also excludes unplanned refinery outages or a possible deep economic recession that cuts demand, analysts said.Refiners will avoid a direct hit by Hurricane Ian, which is taking aim at Florida.“Lower gasoline cracks have pulled refining margins down in recent weeks, but overall margins are still quite attractive,"" said Matthew Blair, head of refining research at energy specialist Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co. “We would expect 90% or higher barring a major hurricane,” he added.Overall U.S. utilization - the amount of oil processed compared to a plant's rated capacity - was above 92% and 93%, respectively, in the second and third quarters this year, he said. The first quarter averaged 89.5%.Profit margins this year have been very strong, but have cooled with declines in gasoline consumption. The margin from selling diesel from a barrel of oil and replacing that barrel, called the diesel crack spread, this week was about $54 per barrel on the Gulf Coast, compared to about $12 a year ago, according to Refinitiv.Refinery operators have run at high levels this year in part due to capacity losses from plant closures during the Coronavirus pandemic. U.S. crude oil capacity is down nearly 1 million barrels per day since early 2020, to 17.9 million barrels per day (bpd).Story continuesDIESEL DEMANDDemand in Europe has made diesel supplies tighter globally, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics, part of consultancy RBN Energy.“Diesel margins will be higher, Auers said. “I think that will be pushing refining margins.”U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in August wrote to refiners Valero Energy, Chevron and Exxon Mobil asking they reduce product exports and build U.S. fuel supplies, citing ""historically low levels of gasoline and diesel in parts of the country.""However, exports of distillate, primarily diesel, soared to 1.76 million bpd in the week ended Sept. 16, from 579,000 bpd a year earlier. At the same time, inventories fell to 117.3 million barrels, down 12 million barrels from the same week a year ago.Worries over tighter diesel supply are boosting refinery runs, said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.""Refiners are worried about the distillate situation being at multi-year lows,” Yawger said. “They’re trying to make more distillate.”Holding runs above 90% runs the risk of further eroding gasoline margins. About 46% of a barrel of oil is processed into gasoline and only 27% to diesel.U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 16 to 214.6 million barrels, the EIA said.Diesel output could jump next year as Exxon completes a 250,000 bpd oil-processing expansion to its Beaumont, Texas, refinery.

The pipelines have a constant internal diameter of 1.153 metres, according to Nord Stream.Sections lie at a depth of around 80-110 metres.WHERE ARE THE LEAKS?Two leaks were detected on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which stopped delivering gas to Europe last month, both in an area northeast of the Danish island of Bornholm.A leak was also detected on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has yet to enter commercial operations, in the same area.Danish authorities have asked ships to stay clear by a five nautical mile radius off Bornholm. The plan to use Nord Stream 2 to supply gas was scrapped by Germany days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February.Both pipelines still contain gas under pressure.WHAT CAUSED THE LEAKS?It is not yet clear. Analysts and experts say such leaks are very rare and Nord Stream AG has called leaks on three strings of the offshore gas pipelines ""unprecedented"".However, the European Union believes sabotage probably caused the leaks, Josep Borrell was reported as saying by German broadcaster ntv, echoing views aired by Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The EU has not named a potential perpetrator or suggested a reason behind it.Story continuesOn Wednesday Moscow said claims that Russia was somehow behind a possible attack on the pipelines were stupid, adding that Moscow saw a sharp increase the profits of U.S. companies supplying gas to Europe.A day earlier the Kremlin had said it did not rule out sabotage as a reason behind the damage and it was an issue affecting the energy security of the ""entire continent"".Seismologists in Denmark and Sweden said they had registered two powerful blasts on Monday in the vicinity of the leaks and the explosions were in the water, not under the seabed.WHO IS INVESTIGATING?Armed forces, coast guards, maritime authories, energy agencies and police from counties such as Sweden, Germany and Denmark are all carrying out investigations.Sweden's Prosecution Authority said it will review material from a police investigation into the damage to the pipelines and decide on further action.Denmark's defence minister has had a meeting with NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, adding it might take a week or perhaps two before the areas around the damaged pipelines were calm enough to be investigated.POTENTIAL IMPACT?Denmark's armed forces said the largest gas leak had caused a surface disturbance of well over 1 kilometre (0.6 mile) in diameter, while agencies issued warnings to shipping to avoid the area.Although neither pipeline was in operation, they both contained natural gas - which is largely composed of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is the second biggest cause of climate change after CO2.This has raised fears that the disruption could cause a climate calamity - although to what extent is still unclear.Norway has said it will strengthen security at its oil and gas installations in the wake of the leaks and reports of drone activities in the North Sea and Danish authorities asked that the level of preparedness in its power and gas sector be raised.(Reporting by Nina Chestney and Reuters bureaux; Editing by Alexander Smith, Alexandra Hudson)]"

Now the gas is flying off into the air.""""Are we interested in that? No, we are not, we have lost a route for gas supplies to Europe,"" Peskov said.Europe has been investigating what Germany, Denmark and Sweden said were attacks which had caused major leaks into the Baltic Sea from two Russian gas pipelines at the centre of an energy standoff.""We see the huge profits of the U.S. suppliers of liquefied natural gas, who increased their supplies many-fold to the European continent,"" Peskov said. ""They are very, very interested in further receiving their super, super profits.""The United States plans to supply at least 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European Union markets this year as Europe seeks to wean itself off Russian gas supplies.Russia, which slashed gas deliveries to Europe after the West imposed sanctions over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine, has said sabotage was a possibility and that the leaks undermined the continent's energy security.Story continues""Before making any claims, we should wait for investigation into these ruptures, whether there was an explosion or not,"" Peskov said. Information on the incident could be expected from Denmark and Sweden, he said.Nord Stream AG, the operator of the network, said on Tuesday that three of four offshore lines of the Nord Stream gas pipeline system sustained ""unprecedented"" damage in one day. All Nord Stream's pipeline had not delivered gas by the time of the incident.Nord Stream 1 has reported a significant pressure drop caused by the gas leak on both lines of the gas pipeline, while Nord Stream 2 said that a sharp pressure drop in line A was registered on Monday.

Investors braced for more havoc in bond markets that has already forced the Bank of England to promise ""significant"" action.Central banks around the world have jacked up interest rates in the last week and said they would do whatever it takes to fight red-hot inflation, particularly as the northern hemisphere winter risks exacerbating a global energy crunch.""Inflation has surprised to the upside everywhere and U.S. dollar strength is becoming a headache for global central banks,"" said Ugo Lancioni, head of global currency at Neuberger Berman.The dominance of the dollar this year has compounded the problem, adding billions to the food and energy import bills for everyone, bar the United States.""The energy supply shock has prompted a terms-of-trade crisis for all energy importing countries. The U.S. dollar is probably entering an 'overshooting' phase driven by risk aversion, lower global growth and higher U.S. real rates,"" he said.Story continuesThe MSCI All-World index fell 0.7%, dropping for a seventh day in a row, to hit its lowest since November 2020.

I can't understand how those who were behind this move didn't understand that. It suggests incompetence. Mechanistically, the UK government is operating like the government of an emerging country,"" he said.Sterling fell 0.6% to $1.0675, still above Monday's record trough of $1.0327 but set for its biggest monthly slide since the Brexit vote in June 2016.The safe-haven dollar has been a major beneficiary from the rout in sterling, rising to a fresh 20-year peak of 114.780 against a basket of currencies.The euro fell for a sixth straight day, dropping 0.4% to $0.95505 narrowly off last week's 20-year low of $0.9528.Oil prices fell to their lowest since the start of the year, dented by concern over demand if the world economy slows, although U.S. production cuts caused by Hurricane Ian helped stem the slide.Brent was last down 0.3% at $86.02 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 0.5% to $78.17 a barrel.(Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Kim Coghill and Angus MacSwan)]"

Russian gas flows via Ukraine have been steady at around 42 million cubic metres per day in recent weeks. Prices had already been buoyed by the discovery of large leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea, in what is widely regarded as an act of sabotage, although by whom or why remains unclear.""Concerns over energy infrastructure safety could maintain a risk premium on winter prices in the short term,"" analysts at Engie Energyscan said.Still, as Nord Stream 2 never started up commercial operation and flows via Nord Stream 1 effectively stopped since late August, the immediate impact of the attacks was limited, analysts said.On the prompt, the British day-ahead contract rose by 30.00 pence to 225.00 p/therm.""We observe tighter market conditions on notably higher residential consumption today and tomorrow,"" analysts at Refinitiv said.The impact of the current cold snap in Britain was however mitigated by increased Norwegian flows and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply, they added.In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract was down by 2.59 euros at 65.37 euros a tonne.(Reporting by Nora Buli in Oslo; editing by Nina Chestney)]"

Washington, which has led efforts to punish Moscow over the war, believes its too soon to conclude there was sabotage, a senior U.S. military official said.""The jury is still out,"" the official told repoters. ""Many of our partners, I think, have determined or believe it is sabotage. I'm just -- I'm not at the point where I can tell you one way or the other."" Asked whether any U.S. involvement in the ruptures could be ruled out, the U.S. military official said: ""We were absolutely not involved.""The U.N. Security Council will convene on Friday at the request of Russia to discuss damage to the pipelines, the French U.N. mission, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for September, said.Story continuesRussia's embassy in Washington said Moscow had asked for the meeting as it ""insists on the need for a comprehensive and objective examination of the circumstances of the unprecedented attacks on Russian pipelines"".The embassy, in an early Thursday statement on its Telegram channel, also accused the United States of attempts to ""squeeze out"" Russia from the energy market through ""non-market methods and sanctions.""The Nord Stream pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between capitals in Europe and Moscow that has damaged major Western economies and sent gas prices soaring.SECURITY ALERTDenmark's defence minister said after a meeting with NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg there was reason to be concerned about the security situation in the region.""Russia has a significant military presence in the Baltic Sea region and we expect them to continue their sabre-rattling,"" Morten Bodskov said in a statement.Norway's prime minister said on Wednesday that its military will be deployed near oil and gas installations, while Denmark is raising its level of preparedness.""The military will be more visible at Norwegian oil and gas installations,"" Norway's Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news briefing.In the Baltic Sea, gas was still bubbling from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the Swedish Coast Guard said in an email.The Danish Energy Agency said more than half the gas in the damaged pipelines had left the pipes and the remaining volume was expected to be gone by Sunday.Jens Schumann, managing director of gas pipeline grid company Gasunie Deutschland, said he was ""relatively optimistic"" that the damage could be repaired.""There are good teams in place to handle pipeline accidents, there are emergency pipe inventories and experts for onshore and offshore,"" Schuman said.But German security agencies fear that Nord Stream 1 will become unusable if large volumes of salt water flow into the pipes and cause corrosion, German newspaper Tagesspiegel reported, citing government sources.The Danish armed forces said the largest gas leak caused a surface disturbance of more than 1 kilometre (0.6 mile) in diameter, as agencies issued warnings to shipping.Sweden's Prosecution Authority said it will review material from a police investigation and decide on further action, after Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said on Tuesday that two blasts had been detected.Although this did not represent an attack on Sweden, Stockholm was in close contact with partners such as NATO and neighbours such as Denmark and Germany, Andersson said.Seismologists in Denmark and Sweden said they had registered two powerful blasts on Monday in the vicinity of the leaks and the explosions were in the water, not under the seabed.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered Washington's support in a call with his Danish counterpart on Wednesday, a senior U.S. defense official said. The State Department said it was sharing information on the blasts with its allies.GAS FLOWSOperator Nord Stream has called the damage ""unprecedented"", while Russian-controlled Gazprom, which has a monopoly on gas exports by pipeline, declined to comment.While neither pipeline was delivering gas to Europe at the time, the incidents scupper any remaining expectations that Europe could receive fuel via Nord Stream 1 before winter.""A development that could have a more immediate impact on gas supplies to Europe was a warning from Gazprom that Russia could impose sanctions on Ukraine's Naftogaz due to ongoing arbitration,"" analysts at ING Research said.Naftogaz's CEO said on Wednesday the Ukrainian energy firm will continue with arbitration proceedings against Gazprom over Russian natural gas which transits the country.Gazprom said earlier in the week that while rejecting all Naftogaz's claims in arbitration, it may introduce sanctions against the company in case it presses ahead with the case.European gas prices rose following news of the leaks. The benchmark October Dutch price was up by 11% at 204.50 euros/megawatt hour on Wednesday. Although prices are still below this year's peaks, they remain more than 200% higher than in early September 2021.Russia reduced gas supplies to Europe via Nord Stream 1 before suspending flows altogether in August, blaming Western sanctions for causing technical difficulties. European politicians say that was a pretext to stop supplying gas.The new Nord Stream 2 pipeline had yet to enter commercial operations. The plan to use it to supply gas was scrapped by Germany days before Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in late February.(Reporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Alexander Smith; Editing by Louise Heavens, Elaine Hardcastle and David Evans)]"

McCormick at a hearing Tuesday to sanction the billionaire and his lawyers for not producing texts with Gorman and Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison. The judge said she was “troubled” by how Musk’s team handled the messages, but said she’ll rule later.Twitter subpoenaed the texts before the Oct. 17 trial in Wilmington, Delaware, in which McCormick will decide whether the world’s richest person had legitimate grounds for walking away from his $54.20-per-share offer to buy the social media platform. Morgan Stanley was Musk’s chief financial adviser and pledged more than $5 billion in financing, while Ellison invested $1 billion.According to Twitter’s court filings, Musk withheld four texts with Gorman, including some from April 25, the day the company accepted Musk’s offer. “The time has come for the court to issue a severe sanction” over the handling of texts and emails by Musk and his top aides, said Bradley Wilson, one of Twitter’s lawyers.During the hearing Tuesday, the Twitter team also complained Musk’s lawyers with dragging their feet in disclosing research that may show the extent of spam and robot accounts on the platform wasn’t nearly as significant as the billionaire claimed publicly.‘Early Morning’ TextsEarlier this month, Twitter’s legal team pointed to a May text by Musk to another Morgan Stanley banker seeking to slow down the deal process until after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech the following day about the war Ukraine. “It won’t make sense to buy Twitter if we’re heading into World War III,” Musk wrote.Twitter is also targeting texts between Musk and Ellison just before the former announced he was withdrawing his offer. The two billionaires were communicating “into the early morning hours,” Twitter said.Story continues“Musk sent his final message to Ellison at 12:20 a.m. on May 13,” according to the filing. About four hours later, Musk tweeted he was putting the deal on hold over concerns Twitter was under-counting the number of bot accounts on the platform.Twitter further complained Musk failed to turn over some of his own texts as well as some from top aide Jared Birchall and lead lawyer Alex Spiro. The company said it was able to obtain some of the texts from the other parties copied in the messages. Twitter called this another example of Musk’s “lackadaisical efforts” to hand over relevant information.A spokesman for Musk’s lawyers didn’t have any immediate comment Tuesday. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, and an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment.McCormick denied a previous Twitter request for sanctions but sharply criticized Musk for failing to turn over texts. She noted Musk produced June 17 texts that Robert Steel of Perella Weinberg sent him 18 minutes apart. Steel first asked a question and then subsequently texted, “Ok. Got it...,” leaving a clear gap in the exchange, the judge said.“Assuming that Musk’s response was not telepathic, one would expect some evidence of it in defendants’ document production,” McCormick wrote. “But defendants provided none by the deadline.”Twitter seeks to convince McCormick that Musk pulled out of the deal because of buyer’s remorse, not over concerns about the number of bots embedded in the platform’s more than 230 million users.On Tuesday, the company’s lawyers complained their counterparts were dragging their feet in turning over unredacted reports by data scientists hired by Musk to assess the bot issue.Some of the materials already produced show Musk’s experts found only about 11% of the customer base was made up of bots, Wilson said. Twitter estimated in securities filings bots make up about 5%.Musk claims his analysis shows as much as a third of Twitter’s customers may be robots rather than humans and the platform’s executives misled him and company investors about the issue to protect advertising revenue.“We think it’s clear why” the Tesla CEO wants to avoid turning over the full bot reports because they are at odds with his estimates, Wilson said. McCormick said she’d rule later on the issue.The case is Twitter v.

Let's start with what we're seeing from the big banks. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley among 16 firms that have reached an agreement with the SEC. They're going to pay regulators $1.1 billion in penalties for failing to monitor employees' use of unauthorized messaging apps.And we know it has been a tough go at it for some of the big banks, at least over the past month, in this rising rate environment. Also, fears of an economic slowdown. You can see Goldman Sachs off just around 13% in the past month. Citi down just over 14%. Bank of America off about 10%, and Morgan Stanley, the best of the bunch over the past month, off just around 8 and 1/2%.All right, let's take a look at Meta because it was Sheryl Sandberg's last day at headquarters. She got a sendoff from a number of her employees, thanking her for the job that she has done for the company over the last several years. She announced back on June 1 that she was stepping down as COO. It has certainly been a rough year for Meta, as the company transitions its focus to the Metaverse. Year to date, taking a look at that stock, off just around 60% today, right around 52-week lows at 134.40.Let's round it out with MindMed, a huge performer here-- or underperformer, I should say-- in after hours. Some news here announcing a proposed public offering of common shares, offering those subject to market conditions. We're seeing that stock tank after hours. And of course, just taking a look at a year to date chart, it's been a rough go at it for this company, off just around 70%.

Moreover, FE’s current dividend yield of 4% is better than the industry’s average of 3.2%.TailwindsStrategic investments help FirstEnergy serve its six million customers more efficiently. In the past several years, the regulated distribution segment experienced rate base growth through systematic investments.FE expects to invest $17 billion in the 2021-2025 period, of which $8.6 billion will be directed toward grid modernization and increasing resiliency, $1.7 billion for conservation and $6.5 billion for a clean energy transition and customer-centric growth projects.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, currently worth about US$4.7b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Salesforce Tell Us?An insider sold Salesforce shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 4 warning signs for Salesforce that deserve your attention before buying any shares.But note: Salesforce may not be the best stock to buy.

Walgreens suggests patients carry any current medications in a waterproof bag – even if the bottle is empty. The information on the prescription label will help pharmacy staff with refill requests. Heat, humidity and sunlight can degrade the effectiveness of medicine and therefore it is important to protect prescriptions from extreme weather conditions.

As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income, and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.Business OutlookOur outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") incorporates current assumptions and market conditions. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could alter our guidance. With consideration of these impacts, we have updated our guidance as follows:Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) is now anticipated to grow in the range of 11% to 12%.Other aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2023 remain unchanged from what we provided previously.(1) Adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. GAAP measures.

After taking the recent loss into consideration, the US$21m worth of stock they bought is now worth US$23m, indicating that their investment yielded a positive return.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StarbucksOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by CEO, Founder &amp; Director Howard Schultz for US$10.0m worth of shares, at about US$73.10 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$84.81), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 274.75k shares worth US$21m. On the other hand they divested 26.96k shares, for US$3.0m. In total, Starbucks insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Starbucks Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Starbucks insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. In total, insiders bought US$6.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any sales whatsoever. This makes one think the business has some good points.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Starbucks insiders own 2.1% of the company, worth about US$2.0b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Starbucks Insiders?It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Along with the high insider ownership, this analysis suggests that insiders are quite bullish about Starbucks. That's what I like to see! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Starbucks you should be aware of, and 2 of these are significant.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(Nasdaq: SNPS) today announced an innovative streaming fabric technology that shortens both silicon data access and test time by up to 80% while also minimizing excessive power. Generated by Synopsys TestMAX® DFT design-for-test tool and part of Synopsys' cohesive silicon lifecycle management flow, the new streaming fabric is a unique on-chip network that quickly transports silicon data to and from multiple design blocks and multi-die systems, significantly reducing the time to efficiently test and analyze the overall health of the chip for anomalies and failures.""Enfabrica is building leading-edge silicon at the heart of hyper-distributed compute systems, and we require state-of-the-art silicon lifecycle management technologies to meet our quality goals,"" said Rochan Sankar, CEO at Enfabrica. ""Synopsys' new streaming fabric technology has demonstrated substantially reduced test time on our designs versus existing approaches. We're very pleased with the results and are counting on these gains in our silicon testing.""To learn more about the Synopsys Silicon Lifecycle Management family of products, visit: https://www.synopsys.com/solutions/silicon-lifecycle-management.html. To learn more about the new streaming fabric technology in the Synopsys TestMAX family, visit: https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/test-automation.html.Lowering Test Costs Through Reduced Data Transport Time Ensuring silicon health and uptime requires constant access and analysis of chip or multi-die system data on parameters such as process, voltage and temperature. For large, advanced-node designs, engineering teams typically use a divide-and-conquer approach by incorporating data access into each design block, and then connecting the blocks to the chip-level pins. Traditional networks are rather rigid, requiring a significant amount of planning. By contrast, the new streaming fabric technology takes a plug-and-play approach, calling for minimal planning effort since it can be programmed to accommodate various block speeds and data interface sizes. To minimize the routing, the fabric supports simplified branching for blocks with small data interfaces. These capabilities ensure block-level data access methodologies are physical design-friendly, require minimal effort and provide the shortest amount of required access time, lowering test costs. Furthermore, the technology's simplified branching connections minimize the physical impact on designs, enabling engineering teams to quickly deploy the streaming fabric using the Synopsys Digital Design Family.Story continuesEnhancing Data Reliability Via Accurate Power Estimation Data, including test programs, applied to chips or multi-die systems in the field must not cause the silicon to utilize too much power, which could either damage the part or invalidate results. New power estimation technology incorporated in Synopsys TestMAX ATPG pattern generation solution more accurately determines power drawn at data application time versus prior methods by assigning results from Synopsys PrimePower RTL-to-signoff power analysis technology. As a result, power drop is mitigated, avoiding incorrect silicon data results and damage.""Efficient, cost-effective silicon data access is a fundamental requirement to achieving reliable device operation during their lifecycles, which is essential for high uptime of mission-critical applications,"" said Amit Sanghani, senior vice president of the Synopsys Hardware Analytics and Test team. ""Our new streaming fabric and more accurate power-estimation capabilities further strengthen our Silicon Lifecycle Management family of products, ensuring customers can meet these goals while achieving design and schedule targets.""About SynopsysSynopsys, Inc.

For more on this story, we're joined by the president of that union, Lyn Montgomery, of the Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents the airline's more than 18,000 flight attendants. Nice to see you. In a statement, you say, never before in the history of Southwest have working conditions deteriorated so rapidly. What changed for flight attendants in the last couple of years?LYN MONTGOMERY: Well, the last couple of years have been extraordinarily difficult for flight attendants at Southwest Airlines. And actually, some of these issues existed even before the last couple of years, which I'll call the pandemic years. But we have had to work long, exhausting hours. We're having to sit on call 24/7 hours, which is causing some of our flight attendants to stay up 24 hours. We have been just the victims, along with our passengers, of horrific technological failures that have created chaos throughout our personal lives and our daily work schedules. And we're just really needing to see some changes.SEANA SMITH: Lyn, what are some of those horrific technological failures that you just mentioned?LYN MONTGOMERY: Yes, so the company has experienced technological breakdowns large enough to impact nationwide flights, nationwide, where flight attendants have been-- had to wait for hours on end just to find out what their next assignment was or when they would be going to a hotel or where their hotel was. I mean, we have reports of flight attendants having to wait three to four hours on hold with crew scheduling for their assignments and hotel reservations.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And I understand there's been a number of delays during this negotiation process. How has that affected your ability to really negotiate?LYN MONTGOMERY: Well, unfortunately, the negotiations have not been going productively or fruitfully. So we have filed for mediation and will be meeting with the mediator in November with the company and a federal mediator because we haven't found that the talks have been progressing at all.DAVE BRIGGS: Specifically, what is the number one thing you and your fellow flight attendants need from Southwest at this moment?LYN MONTGOMERY: Well, we really need Southwest Airlines to understand that we can't be saying sorry anymore with all these technological breakdowns. We need quality of life changes. And we need to be paid for all of our hours worked.SEANA SMITH: In terms of the pay incentive there, obviously, a very critical part, a very important part of this contract that you're trying to negotiate with Southwest, I guess, more specifically, are you looking for an increase in terms of salaries for what you're already working, or just those additional hours?LYN MONTGOMERY: Increase in pay is always something that's on the table. But we are actually looking for a lot of quality of life issues. When Southwest Airlines has these operational breakdowns or you are delayed because of weather, it's really having an impact on flight attendants' lives. And we're not seeing pay for that overtime that we have to put in if we have to stay a few hours or many hours after our shift or even working extra days. We're not actually seeing that pay as good as we should be seeing it.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And what about some of the benefits that you're also looking at in terms of things like better health benefits?LYN MONTGOMERY: Well, one of the most tragic things I think that can happen to a Southwest Airlines flight attendant is when she or he gets injured in the line of duty. You can actually lose your flight benefits while you're out on the job, injury leave. And that's just really despicable when you have been working in the line of duty, and you get injured. We also want to be able to see that flight attendants can retire. And we also want to see that if you are having a need to stay home with your children or need to breastfeed, that you're given the time to be able to do so without losing your health benefits.DAVE BRIGGS: And just to be clear, you are not striking. Are you willing to strike? And one of the most recent changes in the last several months has been alcohol has returned to airplane flights. How has that changed working conditions for flight attendants?LYN MONTGOMERY: Well, initially, when the alcohol returned, we were still under the mask mandate. And that was really the difficulty there because flight attendants were having to govern the wearing of the masks. And that really generated a hostility on board the aircraft, and flight attendants ended up having to be the victims of many assaults and aggressions from people who were upset that they were required to wear a mask.SEANA SMITH: Lyn, what has the response from Southwest been? Have they been open to some of the changes that you and other flight attendants that you're representing want to make?LYN MONTGOMERY: Southwest Airlines really doesn't want us to ask for as much change as we need to see. They've been asking us to narrow our scope. Unfortunately, the flight attendant's contract really hasn't changed significantly since 2009, but our operation has changed dramatically. So we really need to see a contract that steps up and stays in line with the operation that we have today.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so I want to ask you, obviously, about hiring. A lot of people seeing this news, seeing the moves coming from Southwest. What is this doing in terms of the new hire pipeline? How is the union addressing that?LYN MONTGOMERY: So the company is hiring quite a lot. We actually meet with new hires while they're still in class. And we have a new hire committee where we reach out and talk to them. And I have to tell you, it's a little disheartening because many of the new hire flight attendants that are coming to Southwest Airlines are feeling the impact of the exhaustion after a long day because of the way that our duty days work and the way that we are scheduled. And they are quite surprised by that. And some are considering leaving.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Goodness. Well, we certainly hope that's not the case. We thank you for what you are doing. Transportation Workers Union Local 556 President Lyn Montgomery.Well, we reached out to Southwest for comment, and they had this to say. ""Southwest Airlines has an award-winning culture that respects our employees and encourages them to express their opinions. Southwest looks forward to continuing negotiations with TWU 556 and the National Mediation Board so that we can reward our flight attendants and continue attracting great talent."" We certainly hope there is a middle ground that can be reached there.]"

Let's start with what we're seeing from the big banks. Goldman Sachs, Citi, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley among 16 firms that have reached an agreement with the SEC. They're going to pay regulators $1.1 billion in penalties for failing to monitor employees' use of unauthorized messaging apps.And we know it has been a tough go at it for some of the big banks, at least over the past month, in this rising rate environment. Also, fears of an economic slowdown. You can see Goldman Sachs off just around 13% in the past month. Citi down just over 14%. Bank of America off about 10%, and Morgan Stanley, the best of the bunch over the past month, off just around 8 and 1/2%.All right, let's take a look at Meta because it was Sheryl Sandberg's last day at headquarters. She got a sendoff from a number of her employees, thanking her for the job that she has done for the company over the last several years. She announced back on June 1 that she was stepping down as COO. It has certainly been a rough year for Meta, as the company transitions its focus to the Metaverse. Year to date, taking a look at that stock, off just around 60% today, right around 52-week lows at 134.40.Let's round it out with MindMed, a huge performer here-- or underperformer, I should say-- in after hours. Some news here announcing a proposed public offering of common shares, offering those subject to market conditions. We're seeing that stock tank after hours. And of course, just taking a look at a year to date chart, it's been a rough go at it for this company, off just around 70%. But even in just the last three months, we have seen this biopharma company under a tremendous amount of pressure, off just around 43%.]"

Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal. Allie, let's talk about how this fits into that revamped film strategy.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, well, Netflix has really leaned on a strategy of, quote, ""fewer and better"" titles, specifically when we talk about their movies. ""Blonde,"" of course, has been making waves in the headlines. It's been-- there's been buzz about Oscars, potentially, but a big question is whether or not big budget films like ""Blonde"" are worth the sky high production costs, especially since Netflix has been so focused on profitability.""The Gray Man,"" for example, was the last big budget film that Netflix released. $200 million to produce, an A-list cast, there's already a sequel in the works. But it spent just eight days on the Netflix top 10 list. In fact, viewership dropped a whopping 60% in week 2, and then by another 46% in week 3. You can see a lot of those other films also following similar patterns. Huge opening in that first week, and then a very steep drop-off the rest of the month.Now, all that being said, ""The Gray Man"" still racked up a significant amount of views, 245 million hours of viewing time in its first 28 days, the number 4 most watched Netflix original. But that probably is still a disappointment for Netflix, considering that $200 million budget. So I think a bigger question that investors and analysts are asking, is Netflix leaving money on the table by not releasing a film like that in theaters first? And that's something that they're going to have to address and deal with. We'll see if ""Blonde"" follows that similar pattern and whether or not Netflix will update that strategy as a result.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, the bar certainly a higher one, especially given some of the slowdown that we've seen in subscriber numbers and the expectation of profitability. Allie Canal, as always, thanks so much for that.]"

Lastikka is a 19-year veteran of the mobile games business, having worked with both Electronic Arts and Zynga, where he served as a VP and general manager. He co-founded Zynga’s Helsinki studio, which was responsible for the game FarmVille 3.He follows former Zynga chief creative officer Mike Verdu, who joined Netflix last year as vice president of game development.Netflix is moving into the video game space as its subscriber growth slows and customers grow weary of streaming video after binging so much during the heart of the pandemic. The company, last July, announced it would begin adding games to its subscription plans at no additional cost.“We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,” it said at the time.Netflix, to date, has roughly 30 games available in its library, which is largely a hit-or-miss assortment that leans a bit heavy into Stranger Things.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2022 earnings per share suggests a year-over-year improvement of roughly 186%.What's Favoring the Stock?PSX has a diversified business model, having a significant presence in businesses related to refining midstream, chemicals and marketing &amp; specialties. In each of the operations, Phillips 66 has a sound footprint pertaining to safety, profitability, size and competitive strengths.It is focusing more on businesses like midstream, renewables and chemicals. This is making Phillips 66’s business model more stable. The firm’s premier midstream operations comprise U.S. pipeline network, spread across 22,000 miles. Included in the midstream portfolio are 20 crude terminals and 39 product terminals.The midstream business also includes more than 500,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity and 150,000 barrels per day of processing capacity. Thus, with a robust midstream business portfolio, Phillips 66 will generate stable cashflows with lower exposure to energy business volatility.On a positive note, Phillips 66’s net debt level has returned to the pre-pandemic mark. PSX’s financial strength is also reflected in its strong investment-grade credit ratings. PSX, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), also has a disciplined capital allocation strategy.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther prospective players in the same space include Chesapeake Energy Corporation CHK, Enterprise Products Partners LP EPD and Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. While Chesapeake Energy sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Enterprise Products and ExxonMobil carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chesapeake Energy is a premium natural gas operator and is well-positioned to gain from the significant improvement in gas price in the past year. In the prolific gas-rich Marcellus shale play, CHK’s operation spreads across roughly 650,000 net acres, where an average of four to five rigs will be operating this year. Chesapeake Energy also has a strong presence in Haynesville and Eagle Ford shale play, making the production outlook bright. Overall, being a leading upstream energy player, CHK has a more than 15 years of inventory, signifying more than 2,200 gas locations.Story continuesEnterprise Products generates stable fee-based revenues from its extensive pipeline network across more than 50,000 miles, transporting natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil petrochemicals and refined products.The midstream infrastructure provider also has storage assets that can hold more than 260 million barrels of NGL, petrochemical, refined products and crude oil. These assets can also store 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Moreover, Enterprise Products has $5.5 billion of major capital projects under construction that are likely to provide incremental fee-based revenues.The positive trajectory in oil price is a boon for ExxonMobil’s upstream operations.

(NYSE:TJX) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 20.9x P/E ratio. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.TJX Companies certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies peKeen to find out how analysts think TJX Companies' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For TJX Companies?In order to justify its P/E ratio, TJX Companies would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 37% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen a 15% overall rise in EPS, aided extensively by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why TJX Companies is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.As we suspected, our examination of TJX Companies' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Story continuesIt's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with TJX Companies (at least 1 which is potentially serious), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

99,a99ced90-5f45-33f5-a5e7-c7c901115706,M,2022-09-28,Macy’s Marketplace Play: What It Means,WWD,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a99ced90-5f45-33f5-a5e7-c7c901115706/macy%E2%80%99s-marketplace-play%3A-what.html,1664362800,STORY,['M'],"[Macy’s has launched its digital marketplace platform, significantly expanding its offering of categories and brands available on macys.com and providing sellers with a wider audience of potential shoppers.This fall, via its marketplace, macys.com will make available 400 brands not previously sold at Macy’s, across 20 categories. Of the 20, eight categories are new to Macy’s: electronics, video games, floral gifts, gift tissue/wrapping paper, vitamins, sports nutrition, computers and peripherals, and wellness.More from WWDBackstage at Macy's Herald SquareHoliday Windows 2019Executives Tackle What's in Store at Global Retailing ConferenceThe marketplace is geared to grow Macy’s volume and profitability and meet the demand for products that the retailer’s shoppers requested but couldn’t find on its website or in Macy’s stores in the past. The online offering will grow over time.A huge chunk of Macy’s volume is generated online. Last year, of Macy’s Inc.’s $24.46 billion in total sales, digital represented 35 percent, a 9 percentage point decline from 2020, but a 10 percentage point improvement over 2019.Executives from the department store retailer told WWD that the marketplace is being “seamlessly” integrated into the product assortment of the e-commerce site, meaning that customers shopping online and through Macy’s mobile app should feel minimal differences. On the product pages, marketplace items sold by a third party and shipped by it are indicated.Brands, third-party merchants, and/or individual products sign up through the marketplace platform to sell their products on macys.com. With the marketplace format, Macy’s does not own that merchandise or manage the shipping to customers, but gets commissions on the sales. This is different than owned merchandise that is bought by Macy’s merchants, held in its warehouses and delivered to customers by the retailer. It’s also different from drop shipping where Macy’s also owns the goods that are sold on macys.com, but shipped by the supplier.Story continuesFor the past couple of weeks, Macy’s has been testing its online marketplace with certain products and brands, but on Wednesday it was officially launched with more products. Many of the 400 brands are already being offered and others will be listed later this fall.Digital marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Alibaba, Farfetch and Shopify list a vast array of categories and items. Some are characterized as “generalists,” meaning they offer everything to everybody without having a sharp identity or clear image.More recently, a fast-growing subset of smaller marketplaces has been emerging, providing additional competition for Macy’s, such as Express, Hudson’s Bay, Best Buy, Stadium Goods, Lands’ End, Crate &amp; Barrel, Urban Outfitters and StockX. They enable retailers to present wider assortments, accelerate sales volumes, and reach more consumers, whom they hope won’t surf competitors on the internet as much to get what they want.“While there are many very large marketplaces out there, Macy’s competitive advantage is our curation, our merchants’ lens, that we bring to all of the categories that we sell, and we want to make sure that manifests through our marketplace offering as well,” Matt Baer, Macy’s Inc.’s chief digital and customer officer, told WWD in an exclusive interview.“For us, marketplace is a multiyear journey, and our commitment is to build a best-in-class seller experience and best-in-class customer experience,” said Baer. “I am really confident that as we open up the marketplace to additional sellers and additional brands, we will be able to maintain that really strong curation and great customer experience, and that marketplace will continue to evolve and grow and will be a critical platform for Macy’s future success.”Matt BaerBaer said Macy’s has more than 44 million customers — those who have shopped the retailer at least once in the trailing 12 months. They provide “a ton of information in terms of what they are looking for when they are shopping at Macy’s and also what other products and categories and retailers they are shopping when they are not at Macy’s. We are able to use that information to determine what are the best categories for us to get into, from a marketplace assortment perspective. That list evolves over time as well as we enter new or adjacent categories with the aim of best serving the customer and meeting their demand for categories, products and brands that they expect, or are comfortable with Macy’s selling.”With a marketplace, speed is another advantage, Baer said. “A marketplace platform allows you to get product to customers more quickly than you would otherwise be able to in a more traditional merchant channel, so we can stay ahead of style and trend. If we identify a style or trend in the market, we can find a seller that has that product available, and we can onboard that product to the marketplace and have the product available almost immediately.”Baer also said that marketplace “enables another channel, where we can ensure that we are fulfilling the product to customers in the most profitable manner possible.”In addition, “as we build the strategy,” Baer said, “It’s really helping us to accomplish some of our other enterprise goals, like our support for ‘Mission Everyone,’ which is Macy’s social purpose program to promote and sell women-owned, diverse-owned and sustainable brands.” This fall, 20 percent of marketplace sellers and brands will be from “underrepresented enterprises,” according to Macy’s.Some products that wind up getting listed on macys.com through the marketplace could also wind up being displayed in Macy’s stores. As Baer said, “Another benefit of the marketplace platform is that it allows merchants to test consumer response to categories, brands, styles and products. Where we see a strong consumer response we would consider including in future store assortment plans.”Bloomingdale’s will also be launching the marketplace format on its website. “Our goal is next year,” Baer said, without being more specific on that timing. Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, as well as Bluemercury, are divisions of Macy’s Inc.With any marketplace, there are risks. Brands sometimes find themselves near other brands of inferior quality, affecting perceptions. Brands also risk cannibalizing their sales on one marketplace from another. In addition, if a consumer orders from a marketplace and is disappointed by a poor shipping experience (it arrives late or the wrong product is delivered) the marketplace might be blamed and its reputation suffer, even though it could be the fault of the brand handling the shipping.However, Baer said with the Macy’s marketplace, it’s been “a year of intense work creating an exceptional experience for customers and sellers.” He emphasized that the marketplace platform has been “seamlessly integrated into Macy’s digital shopping experience, giving our customers access to an array of expertly curated products — from apparel and beauty to home improvement, toys, pet products and more.“What was really important for us is that we created the most seamless customer experience we could. The customer would have notification at the point of sale or on the item page, in terms of who the seller is and who would be fulfilling that product, and there are a couple of points of distinction in the post purchase experience as well,” Baer explained. “But we really made sure that as we were building the platform we were creating a best-in-class experience for marketplace transactions.”Select Macy’s marketplace categories and new brands include:Baby and children’s apparel: Bonsie Baby, Dabble &amp; Dollop, Wabi Baby.Beauty and wellness: L’Occitane, Mary Ruth’s.Electronics: LG, Samsung, Sony, TCL.Gifting:The Million Roses, Teaspressa, Wrappr.Home: Ettitude, Smeg, Sunday Citizen, W&amp;P.Maternity: Everly Grey, Ingrid &amp; Isabel.Pets: Little Beast.Toys and video games: Magna-Tiles.“We are not focused on sku (stock keeping unit) growth, because it is so important for us that the assortment is curated,” Baer said. “So we are really focused on getting the right brands and categories on-site and making sure we are not creating any goals internally that would potentially dilute that customer experience.With the initial 20 categories that Macy’s chose to focus on with marketplace, “a lot of those categories were really easy for us to identify based on what consumers were telling us and based on what they were expecting us to carry — things like beauty and wellness, or electronics or maternitywear, or pets,” Baer said, referring to pet accessories and other products, not the pets themselves.“There is also some adjacency opportunities or expansion opportunities that might not be quite as obvious today, but will tomorrow as we continue to build out our Toys ‘R’ Us partnership. As we begin to enter video games through our marketplace platform, there then becomes natural extensions to other categories like sports cards and memorabilia. Even if it’s not our first choice today, it becomes a really obvious choice tomorrow, as we continue to expand our product offering.”Macy’s marketplace is powered by Mirakl, a major marketplace technology company, and customized by Macy’s digital, merchant and technology teams.“We made extensive research and identified what the best-in-class solutions are out there in order to provide the best seller experience,” Baer said. “We became very confident that Mirakl partnering with Macy’s was the right path forward to create the best experience and to get to market as quickly as possible.“The Macy’s brand is very meaningful for customers. It stands for quality, curation, and we have a point of view that helps customers own their style. Our process in building the marketplace and identifying sellers and curating an assortment that we bring onto the platform is one that is highly creational and we have the best merchants in the world and they are involved in that process in terms of identifying the sellers and curating the assortment. We offer to customers an opportunity to access this assortment, that is also curated and aligned and has the right adjacencies to our existing owned and drop ship assortment,” he continued. “It also becomes a great benefit to sellers to have access to Macy’s really strong network of customers. It is a really awesome opportunity for sellers to get their products and brands exposure, and we have had a ton of success going to market and talking to prospective sellers that are so excited about the prospect.”“Our marketplace complements our existing omnichannel strategy and is another platform we will use to find the most efficient distribution strategy for our partners. Not only will we continue to maximize brands and existing assortments, but we will use the marketplace to test and customize our assortments based on customer demand,” Josh Janos, Macy’s Inc. vice president of marketplace, said in a statement.Last February, Macy’s Inc. chairman and chief executive officer Jeff Gennette said Macy’s has decided not to spin off its digital business, after a review of its operations. Macy’s had been under pressure from activist shareholder Jana Partners, to create separate dot-com and brick-and-mortar store businesses.“This was a very comprehensive review…pressure-testing our strategy that we are maximizing shareholder value,” Gennette said.The review was undertaken by the board along with management and AlixPartners, a leading retail consultancy that worked on Hudson’s Bay Co.’s separation of its dot-com and brick-and-mortar operations at the Saks Fifth Avenue, Hudson’s Bay and Saks Off 5th divisions.“Key to the decision by Macy’s management and the board was that an integrated Macy’s delivered greater value than the separation of physical assets,” Gennette told WWD. They also concluded that spinning off the dot-com business would result in “really high” separation costs, as well as ongoing costs of operating separate companies, and execution risks, Gennette said.Gennette added that Macy’s was heavily investing in its dot-com business and that the company’s three-year, $3 billion cap-ex budget was largely devoted to growing the digital business by launching a marketplace.An illustration of a new brand on macys.com, listed via the marketplace format.]"

The new employees will be posted at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as well as its supply-chain locations and call centers.This reflects a decline from last year when Macy’s hired 48,000 seasonal associates for the 2021 holiday season. M also noted that seasonal workers have the opportunity for seasonal workers to transit into permanent roles.Kroger KR recently unveiled its hiring plan for the current holiday season. KR is likely to recruit 1,500 associates for full and part-time positions for their North Texas stores.Vacancies are available in all departments, including retail, e-commerce, manufacturing, supply chain, merchandising, logistics, corporate, pharmacy and healthcare. Kroger hired more than 20,000 associates through its nationwide hiring event for the 2021 holiday sale.We note that the overall year-over-year decline in holiday hiring can be attributable to sluggish consumer demand ahead of the holidays.

102,dd294118-d10a-3eb7-921e-1ced2addae5d,NOV,2022-09-28,U.S. oil refinery run-rates could top 90% for 3rd quarter in a row,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-oil-refinery-run-rates-111424914.html,1664363664,STORY,['CL=F'],"[By Erwin SebaHOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil refinery utilization rates, a measure of how operators view future fuel demand, could top 90% next quarter for the third consecutive period, industry analysts projected, reflecting scant stocks and strong demand for diesel.Historically, utilization rates fall in the fourth quarter as refiners begin winter maintenance and motor fuel consumption slips after U.S. summer driving season ends. This year's final quarter, however, could see operators hold production rates high to grab strong diesel margins, they said.The forecast excludes the potential impact of a major hurricane striking the U.S. Gulf Coast, home of nearly half the nation's oil refining. It also excludes unplanned refinery outages or a possible deep economic recession that cuts demand, analysts said.Refiners will avoid a direct hit by Hurricane Ian, which is taking aim at Florida.“Lower gasoline cracks have pulled refining margins down in recent weeks, but overall margins are still quite attractive,"" said Matthew Blair, head of refining research at energy specialist Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co. “We would expect 90% or higher barring a major hurricane,” he added.Overall U.S. utilization - the amount of oil processed compared to a plant's rated capacity - was above 92% and 93%, respectively, in the second and third quarters this year, he said. The first quarter averaged 89.5%.Profit margins this year have been very strong, but have cooled with declines in gasoline consumption. The margin from selling diesel from a barrel of oil and replacing that barrel, called the diesel crack spread, this week was about $54 per barrel on the Gulf Coast, compared to about $12 a year ago, according to Refinitiv.Refinery operators have run at high levels this year in part due to capacity losses from plant closures during the Coronavirus pandemic. U.S. crude oil capacity is down nearly 1 million barrels per day since early 2020, to 17.9 million barrels per day (bpd).Story continuesDIESEL DEMANDDemand in Europe has made diesel supplies tighter globally, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics, part of consultancy RBN Energy.“Diesel margins will be higher, Auers said. “I think that will be pushing refining margins.”U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in August wrote to refiners Valero Energy, Chevron and Exxon Mobil asking they reduce product exports and build U.S. fuel supplies, citing ""historically low levels of gasoline and diesel in parts of the country.""However, exports of distillate, primarily diesel, soared to 1.76 million bpd in the week ended Sept. 16, from 579,000 bpd a year earlier. At the same time, inventories fell to 117.3 million barrels, down 12 million barrels from the same week a year ago.Worries over tighter diesel supply are boosting refinery runs, said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.""Refiners are worried about the distillate situation being at multi-year lows,” Yawger said. “They’re trying to make more distillate.”Holding runs above 90% runs the risk of further eroding gasoline margins. About 46% of a barrel of oil is processed into gasoline and only 27% to diesel.U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 16 to 214.6 million barrels, the EIA said.Diesel output could jump next year as Exxon completes a 250,000 bpd oil-processing expansion to its Beaumont, Texas, refinery. Offsetting that, LyondellBasell Industries’s plans to permanently close its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery by the end of 2023.(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Both contracts rallied nearly 2% each on Tuesday.Concerns over slowing demand came back into play after data from the American Institute of Petroleum showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose by much more than expected last week, up 4 million barrels as compared to expectations of 333,000 barrels.The figures brewed more concerns that rising interest rates and 40-year high inflation would likely weigh on demand in the near-term.Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also slashed its oil price forecasts, but said that tightening supply, particularly from Russia, would likely spur a rebound in prices early next year.Additionally, the dollar rose back up to near 20-year highs on Wednesday, putting more downward pressure on crude prices. A hawkish Federal Reserve has boosted the dollar this year, and is one of the biggest downward drivers of crude prices.Fears of weakening demand largely offset hopes for a potential supply crunch in the United States.About 11% of U.S. oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, or 190,000 barrels per day (bpd), was shut this week as major producers evacuated some offshore platforms in anticipation of Hurricane Ian.Producers including Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and BP (NYSE:BP) began taking precautions against the storm earlier this week. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about 15% of total U.S. oil production.Additionally, Reuters reported that Russia is set to push for the OPEC+ to cut supply by at least 1 million barrels per day during its monthly meeting next week. Other members of the cartel have also supported production cuts to stabilize oil prices.Story continuesWhile crude prices have plummeted from highs hit earlier this year, tightening supply, particularly from Russia, may provide an upward boost by the year-end. Demand for heating oil during winter may also support prices.Related ArticlesOil Rebound Stalls as Recession Fears Outweigh Supply CrunchOil rises 2% from multi-month lows on U.S. Gulf output cuts, supply outlookGold, Copper Prices Move Little Amid Growing Economic Jitters]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis How Quickly Is Zoetis Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Zoetis has grown EPS by 16% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Zoetis remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 7.9% to US$8.0b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Zoetis.Story continuesAre Zoetis Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Zoetis has a market capitalisation of US$70b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they hold US$49m worth of its stock. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Even though that's only about 0.07% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders.Is Zoetis Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Zoetis is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Zoetis that you should be aware of before investing here.Although Zoetis certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

114,75168fee-e792-3810-a25c-a721f9508d38,ZTS,2022-09-28,These 2 Stock Giants Are Flirting With a Bottom; Analysts Say ‘Buy’,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stock-giants-flirting-bottom-222637677.html,1664317597,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Anyone following stock market trends in 2022 will be well aware of the widespread drawbacks; apart from some outliers such as energy, most corners of the market have been beaten to a pulp.The main culprits are easily identified by now; a combination of a slowing economy, rampant inflation, rates hikes to halt it, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the global implications are all responsible factors.Stock market giants have not been immune either and many have seen huge chunks of their valuations shaved off over the past 12 months.There is a silver lining, however. Shares of many companies with sound prospects are going for cheap and those taking the long-term view could reap the rewards eventually.With this in mind, we've used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two heavyweights whose shares appear to be at 52-week lows, but which have gotten the backing of some Street experts recently. In fact, the consensus view is that both are Strong Buys. So, let’s see why the analysts are getting behind these names right now.ServiceNow (NOW)If it’s market giants you’re after, then ServiceNow certainly fits the bill. This SaaS (software-as-a-service) company has a market cap of $77 billion, and has experienced huge growth over the past decade, as it caters to very – excuse the pun - now needs.ServiceNow's cloud-based platform aids businesses in managing their digital operations. There has been a dramatic increase in demand for these services in recent years, with simplified and automated operations substituting unstructured work routines.ServiceNow has obviously done that very successfully as is evident in the numbers. In 2010, it had only 602 clients, which by the end of last year had ballooned to 7,400, with the company catering to around 80% of names on the Fortune 500 list.ServiceNow generated revenue of $244 million in 2012 which increased at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 42.5% to $5.9 billion in 2021. Not only that, but the company is also now consistently profitable.Story continuesIn the latest quarterly report – for 2Q22 – adj. EPS clocked in at $1.62, beating the Street’s $1.55 forecast. Likewise, revenue rose by 30% year-over-year to reach of $1.82 billion, outpacing the analysts’ prediction by $60 million. The bulk of that was generated by subscription revenues, which at $1.66 billion, increased by 25% from the same period last year (by 29.5% adjusted for constant currency). However, the company disappointed with the outlook, lowering its FY subscription revenue forecast from between $7.03-$7.04 billion to between $6.915-$6.925 billion.The report failed to impress investors and, in fact, that has been the trend all year, with NOW shares falling nearly 42%.Get hold of the shares while they’re at these levels, appears to be the take of Wolfe analyst Alex Zukin, who said, “With NOW's combination of efficient growth, best of suite offering, and best-in-class GTM, we see a company that is well positioned to outperform peers in a recessionary environment.""Zukin believes the company is set up for several key catalysts, including: ""1) ITSM Pro &amp; Enterprise adoption, 2) verticalization, and 3) multi-product uptake across the customer base supported by a product portfolio that has dramatically expanded over the last few years and now includes customer workflows, employee workflows, creator workflows, and the NOW platform.”These comments form the basis for Zukin’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating while his $600 price target suggests shares will climb 58% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Zukin’s track record, click here)Overall, almost all of Zukin’s colleagues agree. Barring three skeptics, all 24 other recent analyst reviews are positive, providing this stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $549.81, the average target is set to generate returns of 45% in the months ahead. (See NOW stock forecast on TipRanks)Zoetis (ZTS)Let’s turn now to another giant in its field. Zoetis is the world’s leading animal healthcare company, boasting a market cap of $70 billion. The company is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of animal healthcare products, which span across medications, vaccines, and diagnostics. Spun off from Pfizer in 2013, the company directly takes its products to market in around 45 countries and, in total, are sold in over 100 countries.According to Technavio, the companion animal healthcare market is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 9.25% between 2021 to 2026, growing by $9.82 billion during the period. Being a market leader, Zoetis stands to reap the rewards of that growth.The company just exceeded that expected industry growth in the most recent quarter. In Q2, revenue rose by 10.5% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, coming in $70 million above the Street’s forecast. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.20, however, fell $0.02 short of the $1.22 anticipated on Wall Street. For the full-year, Zoetis expects revenue between $8.225 and $8.325 Billion, practically the same as consensus at $8.27 billion.Like many others, the stock has been unable to counter 2022’s bearish trends and has lost 38% on a year-to-date basis, now resting just above its 12-month low.But assessing the latest print, Cantor analyst Louise Chen thinks Zoetis is primed for more success.“Post the company's 2Q22 results, we continue to like ZTS for its durable and diversified business model,” the analyst said. “We think the earnings potential for ZTS's underlying business is still underappreciated and upside to expectations could come from: 1) higher-than-anticipated peak sales for new launches, 2) better-than-expected operating margin improvements, and/or 3) M&amp;A.”Accordingly, Chen reiterated an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a price target of $250, leaving room for one-year upside of 67%. (To watch Chen’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: ZTS is a Strong Buy. The shares are selling for $149.40 and the $217.40 average price target implies an upside of ~46% in the year ahead.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PepsiCo PEP, Lancaster Colony LANC, Chesapeake Utilities CPK, NextEra Energy NEE and Otter Tail OTTR.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Play It Safe as Market Volatility Climbs on Rate Hike: 5 PicksU.S. stocks suffered losses for yet another week that ended Sep 23 as an increase in interest rates heightened fears of a recession. All the three major benchmarks tumbled on Friday, with the Dow closing below the coveted 30,000-mark for the first time since Jun 17. The blue-chip index was flirting with bear market territory and had dropped 4% for the week, while the broader S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively, per the Dow Jones Market Data.In fact, the major indexes have now registered their fifth negative week out of the last six-week period. On the other hand, Wall Street's fear gauge touched its highest levels in months. In the last trading session, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared above 30 for the first time since Jun 21, indicating that wild intraday gyrations are here to stay. After all, VIX has been known for tracking implied volatility in the upcoming 30-day trading period.Nonetheless, fears that Fed's inflation fight may lead to a possible recession in the near future were primarily responsible for such a brutal bout of selling in recent times. This is because the Fed's aggressive tightening measures to tame high inflation may significantly hamper consumer outlays, increase the cost of borrowing and hold up economic growth.The central bank, recently, increased its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points for the third straight time to the 3-3.25% range, the highest federal funds rate since early 2008. The Fed has further vowed to hike interest rates to drag down inflation to its target of 2% at best by 2025. Talking about inflation, gas prices have dipped. However, prices of food, housing, rent and vehicles have continued to jack up with little relief in sight (Read More: Big Fed Rate Hike a Boon for These 5 Bank Stocks).Story continuesFrom an investment perspective though, investors shouldn't completely shun equities! Instead, they should invest in risk-adjusted stocks like PepsiCo PEP, Lancaster Colony LANC, Chesapeake Utilities CPK, NextEra Energy NEE and Otter Tail OTTR for steady returns.Firstly, these stocks have a low-beta (ranges from 0 to 1) that makes them inherently less volatile than the markets they trade in. Secondly, such stocks are dividend payers indicating a better-quality business, which helps them stand market vagaries. To top it off, the stocks are non-cyclical in nature or, in other words, whose activities aren't allied to the broader market, making them immune to any volatility. Such stocks undoubtedly come from the consumer staples and utility sectors. These stocks also boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PepsiCo is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. The company has a beta of 0.55 and a Zacks Rank #2.

This climate-focused bond index expands S&amp;P DJI's Paris-Aligned and Climate Transition (S&amp;P PACT™) indexing capabilities and adds to its growing line-up of global iBoxx fixed income indices. The iBoxx family of indices is now part of S&amp;P DJI following the completion of S&amp;P Global's merger with IHS Markit earlier this year.The new iBoxx EUR Corporates Net Zero 2050 Paris-Aligned ESG index measures the performance of eligible investment grade corporate bonds which are selected and weighted from its parent iBoxx EUR Corporates index, taking into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) elements.This climate-focused index aims to meet and exceed the standards for the European Union's Paris-Aligned Benchmarks (EU PABs) while incorporating factors to address transition risk and climate change opportunities which are aligned with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Boards' Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In addition, the index optimizes fixed income related risks and returns to closely track the performance of its parent benchmark.""S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is proud to offer a wider range of indexing choices from equities to fixed income to help our customers and other market participants measure and mitigate climate and environmental-related risks. As an independent index provider, our goal is to provide the market with end-to-end multi-asset benchmarking solutions that help facilitate and contribute to long-term sustainability as corporations and institutions transition and strive towards a low-carbon future,"" said Smadar Shulman, EMEA Head of Fixed Income Indices at S&amp;P DJI.

The index screens and excludes constituents that are involved in specific business activities, have violations against the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), and involved in ESG controversies.Story continuesSimilar to S&amp;P DJI's existing S&amp;P PACT Indices, the iBoxx EUR Corporates Net Zero 2050 Paris-Aligned ESG index utilizes multiple ESG data sources including rich proprietary datasets and analytics from Trucost, part of S&amp;P Global.Since 2020, S&amp;P DJI has launched different variations of its equity S&amp;P PACT indices to meet customers diverse needs.

SPGI is currently benefiting from its acquisitions and pro-investor steps. SPGI’s revenues are anticipated to grow 42.7% and 11.5% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Factors That Augur WellAcquisitions have always carved a key growth trajectory for S&amp;P Global. The recent buyout of IHS Markit is expected to enhance S&amp;P Global’s data and analytics offerings. Another acquisition of The Climate Service is expected to enhance SPGI's portfolio of essential environmental, social and governance (ESG) insights and solutions.We are impressed with S&amp;P Global’s endeavors to reward its shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. In 2021, S&amp;P Global returned $743 million to its shareholders in the form of dividend payments. However, it did not repurchase any shares last year due to the pending merger with IHS Markit.In 2020, SPGI returned $1.8 billion to its shareholders, including $1.2 billion through share repurchases and $645 million as dividend payouts. In 2019, S&amp;P Global returned $1.8 billion to its shareholders with $1.2 billion as share repurchases and $560 million of dividend payments.Such shareholder-friendly moves underpin S&amp;P Global’s commitment to creating value for its shareholders and underlining its confidence in its business. These initiatives not only raise investors’ optimism on the stock but also positively impact the earnings per share.A Key RiskS&amp;P Global's current ratio at the end of second-quarter 2022 was pegged at 1.26, lower than the current ratio (a measure of liquidity) of 1.38 reported at the end of first-quarter 2022 and the prior-year quarter’s 2.09.  Decreasing current ratio is not desirable as it indicates SPGI’s many problems in meeting its short-term debt obligations.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderS&amp;P Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Data released today for July 2022 show that home price gains decelerated across the United States. More than 27 years of history are available for the data series and can be accessed in full by going to https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/indicators/sp-corelogic-case-shiller/.YEAR-OVER-YEARThe S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 15.8% annual gain in July, down from 18.1% in the previous month. The 10-City Composite annual increase came in at 14.9%, down from 17.4% in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a 16.1% year-over-year gain, down from 18.7% in the previous month.Tampa, Miami, and Dallas reported the highest year-over-year gains among the 20 cities in July. Tampa led the way with a 31.8% year-over-year price increase, followed by Miami in second with a 31.7% increase, and Dallas in third with a 24.7% increase. All 20 cities reported lower price increases in the year ending July 2022 versus the year ending June 2022.MONTH-OVER-MONTHBefore seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a -0.3% month-over-month decrease in July, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted decreases of -0.8%.After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. National Index posted a month-over-month decrease of -0.2%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted decreases of -0.5% and -0.4%, respectively.In July, only 7 cities reported increases before and after seasonal adjustments.ANALYSIS""Although U.S. housing prices remain substantially above their year-ago levels, July's report reflects a forceful deceleration,"" says Craig J. Lazzara, Managing Director at S&amp;P DJI.  ""For example, while the National Composite Index rose by 15.8% in the 12 months ended July 2022, its year-over-year price rise in June was 18.1%.  The -2.3% difference between those two monthly rates of gain is the largest deceleration in the history of the index.  We saw similar patterns in our 10-City Composite (up 14.9% in July vs. 17.4% in June) and our 20-City Composite (up 16.1% in July vs. 18.7% in June).  On a month-over-month basis, all three composites declined in July.Story continues""The theme of strong but decelerating prices was reflected across all 20 cities.  July's year-over-year price change was positive for each one of the 20 cities, with a median gain of 15.0%, but in every case July's gain was less than June's.  Prices declined in 12 cities on a month-to-month basis.  Tampa (+31.8%) narrowly edged Miami (+31.7%) to remain at the top of the league table for the fifth consecutive month, with Dallas (+24.7%) holding on to third place.  As has been the case for the last several months, price growth was strongest in the Southeast (+27.5%) and South (+26.9%).""As the Federal Reserve continues to move interest rates upward, mortgage financing has become more expensive, a process that continues to this day.  Given the prospects for a more challenging macroeconomic environment, home prices may well continue to decelerate.""SUPPORTING DATATable 1 below shows the housing boom/bust peaks and troughs for the three composites along with the current levels and percentage changes from the peaks and troughs.2006 Peak2012 TroughCurrent Index Level Date Level DateFrom Peak (%) LevelFrom Trough (%)From Peak (%)National184.61Jul-06134.00Feb-12-27.4 %307.45129.4 %66.5 %20-City206.52Jul-06134.07Mar-12-35.1 %316.28135.9 %53.1 %10-City226.29Jun-06146.45Mar-12-35.3 %327.54123.7 %44.7 %Table 2 below summarizes the results for July 2022.

130,71592eaa-b6e6-3d90-b213-57d1a1c72f92,MA,2022-09-28,Visa (V) Declines for 10 Straight Days: Should You be Worried?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-v-declines-10-straight-154203781.html,1664293323,STORY,"['V', 'MA']","[Visa Inc.’s V shares fell 1.8% yesterday, recording 10 straight days of decline. This marks its longest losing streak since it recorded nine straight days of loss in 2013, per MarketWatch. During the 10 sessions, V’s shares fell 12.6%. There are multiple factors that might be shaking investors’ confidence, leading to the persistent decline.Visa Inc. PriceVisa Inc. PriceVisa Inc. price | Visa Inc. QuoteThe growing economic concerns, fueled by high inflation, increasing interest rates and the resultant upset in consumer spending might have spooked the investors, despite Visa’s reassuring spending trend reports. It reported encouraging payment volume growth for July and August. If this trend continues, Visa is likely to register a significant year-over-year increase in volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Another factor that might have alarmed investors is the recently proposed bill by the Congress to enhance competition within credit card processing firms. The Credit Card Competition Act of 2022 is expected to reduce the dominance of Visa and Mastercard Incorporated MA in the processing space and save money for merchants and consumers. This can reduce swipe fees for V and MA, putting pressure on their margins.While Visa registered 10 straight days of share price decline, Mastercard witnessed an eight-day-long losing streak, wherein it lost 11%. This marks MA’s longest losing streak since the 10-day-long losing streak in 2008. Now, beyond the share price declines, the question is whether the two companies can keep their growth momentum steady. If yes, then the share price will jump back up again.What the Future Holds?Both Visa and Mastercard enjoy a massive chunk of the market. While growing competition and lower fees might reduce their potential profit margin, their rising transaction volumes can offset the negatives. The coming holiday season is expected to witness a surge in consumer spending, which will benefit both companies.Story continuesAlso, with their massive size, Visa and Mastercard invest huge amounts of money in technology, security, research and development. Even if competition rises in the coming days, the competitors are not expected to provide the same level of security in transactions for consumers and merchants. With the rising threat to digital transactions, clients will likely keep choosing companies that can provide maximum security.Visa continues to invest in technology to further boost its already leading position in the payments market and minimize the impact of fraud, and protect consumer and merchant information. Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company in recent years to advance its digital platform.Visa is expected to witness growth in the days ahead due to its attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksVisa currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

138,88d49cc9-a8bd-4fda-8b69-b1621dd36639,QCOM,2022-09-28,Intel debuts new 13th-generation chips to take on AMD amid PC sales slump,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-debuts-new-13-th-generation-chips-162010182.html,1664295610,STORY,"['AMD', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'NVDA']","[Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger debuted the company’s 13th-generation Intel Core processors on Tuesday during the chip giant’s annual Intel Innovation event in San Jose, California.The new chips, codenamed Raptor Lake, are designed to put Intel in the performance lead ahead of arch rival AMD (AMD) in the desktop performance space. They also come as PC sales slump following massive growth during the early days of the pandemic.Intel says the top-of-the-line version of the chip, the Core i9-13900K, is the fastest desktop processor on the planet. The chip, which is being marketed towards hardcore gamers and creators, packs a whopping 24 processing cores. Those are broken down into eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores.The performance cores for the new chip are designed to handle your heavy-duty tasks — think gaming, compiling code, and helping with photo and video editing. The efficiency cores are meant to handle less intensive tasks like web browsing, firing off emails, etc. The idea is that your computer can call on the performance cores when it needs some extra horsepower — and rely on the efficiency cores when you’re doing basic tasks and don’t need to drain your neighborhood’s power grid.Intel says its new 13th-gen chip is a beast for gamers and creators. (Image: Intel)“The 13th Gen Intel Core family is the latest example of how Intel is enabling amazing experiences to happen on the PC — at scale and across all PC product segments,” Intel Client Computing Group general manager Michelle Johnston Holthaus said in a statement.The company’s big boast is that the Core i9-13900K chips' speed tops out at a ridiculous 5.8Ghz. That’s important, because it just beats out AMD’s top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen 9 7950X chip, which reaches a speed of 5.7GHz.Of course, most people are unlikely to snag the Core i9-13900K, as it will likely be out of most users’ price ranges. We’re still expecting exact pricing on the chip, but based on past precedent, expect it to be around the $700 range.For those looking for something a bit more wallet-friendly, Intel will also have the usual Core i5 and Core i7 chips, which get performance gains over their 12th-generation predecessors. In total, Intel says the 13th-generation line-up will have 22 processors and be available across 125 partner system designs.Story continuesIn addition to the company’s 13th-generation chips, Intel announced its new Intel Unison software. Designed to better connect your smartphone and your PC, Unison promises improved file transfer capabilities for iOS and Android devices. The company also says you’ll be able to receive text messages, calls, and notifications from your Android phone on your PC.Intel's Unison software is designed to improve communication between your PC and smartphone. (Image: Intel)This isn’t the only software with these kinds of options. Microsoft offers a similar app, though it only works with Android devices. Apple already allows iOS users to make and receive calls, and to send and receive texts from the iPhone on their Macs. Those users can also start apps on their iPhone and pick up where they left off on their Macs.Intel’s announcements come at a critical time for the company. Gelsinger is trying to return Intel to its position as the world’s preeminent chip designer and builder. But it’s going to be a difficult journey as the company contends with rivals like AMD, Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia on the design side and TSMC on the manufacturing side.Intel reported dismal results in the second quarter, missing expectations and pointing to problems with its execution and falling demand for server chips. At the time, Gelsinger announced that Intel would miss its annual sales revenue by as much as $11 billion. The stock is currently hanging on just above its 52-week low of $26.81.“This quarter’s results were below the standards we have set for the company and our shareholders. We must and will do better. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver, but the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues,” Gelsinger said at the time.“We are being responsive to changing business conditions, working closely with our customers while remaining laser-focused on our strategy and long-term opportunities. We are embracing this challenging environment to accelerate our transformation.”Shares of Intel are down 47% year-to-date. AMD is off as much as 53%, while Nvidia is down 58%.Will Intel be able to turn things around? That depends on whether the company can meet its ambitious goal of becoming the chip powerhouse it once was and how long the economy will continue to struggle.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanMeta is desperate to fight back against Apple’s privacy changesApple AirPods Pro add better sound, improved controls to Apple’s best earbudsWindows 11 PC is getting a ton of updates, including live captions, gaming upgradesGot a tip?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $14.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide tooling equipment to support the production of Lot 14 F-135 Propulsion Systems.The contract will cater to the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) participants. A major part of the work related to this deal will be carried out in LaPorte, IN; Syracuse, NY and Oxford, AL.F-35 &amp; Pratt and WhitneyOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted demand for defense products, with combat aircraft constituting a major portion of that portfolio.It is imperative to mention that the F-35 jets built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT enjoy a dominant position in the combat jet market. With F-35 being one of the top-notch stealth aircraft, Lockheed enjoys a consistent inflow of contracts for the production, delivery of associated spare parts and other deals concerning the F-35 jet program.For instance, in August 2022, the company won a significant contract worth $7.6 billion to procure a total of 129 F-35 aircraft, ranging from F-35A to F-35C variations. Such contract wins by Lockheed also benefit Pratt and Whitney, which supplies the F135 engine that powers all three variants of the F-35 fighter jets.Therefore, as the F-35 jet continues to dominate the combat aircraft market, Pratt &amp; Whitney stands to benefit from order flow. The latest contract win is an example of that.Growth ProspectsThe production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps. and Navy. Consequently, Pratt and Whitney is expected to witness more order inflows involving the F-35 program, like the latest one, which should bolster Raytheon Technologies’ top line.Besides Lockheed and Raytheon, Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems Plc BAESY are also poised to gain from the solid production target for F-35, as both of them are key partners in the F-35 program.Story continuesNorthrop renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$408. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Lockheed Martin Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Lockheed Martin. In that time, insider Gregory Ulmer dumped US$2.9m worth of shares. On the other hand we note insider John Donovan bought US$250k worth of shares. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.06% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$67m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?The stark truth for Lockheed Martin is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We'd practice some caution before buying! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. You'd be interested to know, that we found 3 warning signs for Lockheed Martin and we suggest you have a look.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.21%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.43%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.01%.Heading into today, shares of the homebuilder had lost 7.33% over the past month, outpacing the Construction sector's loss of 12.47% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.7% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PulteGroup as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. In that report, analysts expect PulteGroup to post earnings of $2.76 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 51.65%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $4.05 billion, up 16.38% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.15 per share and revenue of $16.72 billion. These totals would mark changes of +52.74% and +20.08%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PulteGroup. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.96% lower. PulteGroup is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesLooking at its valuation, PulteGroup is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 3.4. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 3.31, so we one might conclude that PulteGroup is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that PHM has a PEG ratio of 1.97. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PHM's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.41 as of yesterday's close.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is part of the Construction sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 241, which puts it in the bottom 5% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Patrick Industries (PATK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 27, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.22 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.10 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Patrick Industries has an Earnings ESP of 5.97%.PATK is one of just a large database of Construction stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 25, 2022. PHM's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.81 a share 28 days from its next earnings release.PulteGroup's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.75% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76.Story continuesPATK and PHM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

148,6caea4d1-790d-3409-b351-90c1d3ad1541,PHM,2022-09-28,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pultegroup-inc-130001680.html,1664283601,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this homebuilder have returned -7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.7% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has lost 8.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.76 per share, indicating a change of +51.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.15 points to a change of +52.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.71 indicates a change of -12.9% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.4%. The $16.72 billion and $17.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.1% and +2.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $2.73 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.52%. The EPS surprise was +5.81%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $0.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of medical testing kits would post earnings of $0.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of 12.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Neogen , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $132.35 million for the quarter ended August 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.51%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $128.31 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Neogen shares have lost about 67.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -23.3%.What's Next for Neogen?While Neogen has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Neogen: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Chevron Corp..

The Zacks analyst believes that the company's top line has been growing and the momentum should continue in the years ahead on the back of a strong market position and an attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments and prudent capital deployment through share buybacks and dividends. However, softness in commercial business due to COVID-induced volatilities persists. Also, the rising operating costs are hurting the company's bottom line.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Johnson &amp; Johnson's shares have advanced +2.2% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +6.0%. The Zacks analyst believes that J&amp;J's diversification makes it relatively resilient amid macroeconomic turmoil. Its Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels, supported by its blockbuster drugs, Darzalex and Stelara, and contribution from newer drugs, Erleada and Tremfya. Sales in the MedTech unit are recovering in 2022 and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions.Story continuesHowever, sales in the Consumer and MedTech units are being hurt by inflationary pressure.

The Zacks analyst believes that the company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. America's No. 2 energy company's existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company's high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor's 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Home Depot, Inc., and AT&amp;T Inc..Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

154,86ca5810-2dd9-3d30-8059-36fa36426ca7,MDT,2022-09-28,Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) Shares Could Be 20% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plc-nyse-mdt-shares-130025112.html,1664283625,STORY,['MDT'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Medtronic The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.02bUS$6.15bUS$5.72bUS$6.62bUS$7.15bUS$7.49bUS$7.79bUS$8.06bUS$8.29bUS$8.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.85%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.37%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$4.7kUS$5.0kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.0%– 1.9%) = US$171bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$171b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$136b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.3, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 13% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 40% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber. See our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10.0% and 7.3% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Goodyear Tire &amp; RubberThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$14m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

(NYSE:CCI) shareholders have seen the share price descend 13% over the month. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. In that time, it is up 51%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 54%.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Crown Castle To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Crown Castle achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free interactive report on Crown Castle's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Crown Castle the TSR over the last 5 years was 79%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Crown Castle shares lost 12% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 23%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Crown Castle  you should be aware of.Crown Castle is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.21% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.43%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.01%.Coming into today, shares of the pharmaceutical company had lost 1.61% in the past month. In that same time, the Medical sector lost 6.56%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 9.7%.Merck will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 27, 2022. In that report, analysts expect Merck to post earnings of $1.74 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 0.57%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.4 billion, up 9.47% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.33 per share and revenue of $59.04 billion. These totals would mark changes of +21.76% and +17.72%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Merck. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

Nevertheless, the stock jumped 4.91% in after-hours trading.The FDA’s Fast Track designation accelerates the development and review of new drugs or biologics that have been developed to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The designation will allow Atea to engage in frequent communications with the FDA to discuss the development plan of AT-752 for treating dengue virus infection and facilitate a rolling review of any completed sections of a resulting new drug application (NDA).Dengue is one of the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral diseases affecting more than half the world’s population.AT-752 works by impairing the dengue viral polymerase, which then inhibits replication of the virus.Atea is currently conducting two studies on AT-752. The first study is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study in adult patients with dengue virus infection. The study is designed to evaluate the antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of AT-752 in areas where dengue is endemic.  The candidate was generally well tolerated in phase I clinical study and is currently in phase II.The second study is a human challenge study conducted in the United States. The challenge study is designed to evaluate healthy subjects who are challenged with a dengue virus-1 live attenuated virus strain after receiving AT-752 or placebo.Results from the human challenge trial and initial results from the DEFEND-2 study are expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.Shares of the company have plunged 38.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 27.9%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAtea is focused on the development of orally available, potent and selective nucleos(t)ide prodrugs for difficult-to-treat, life-threatening viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, dengue virus, chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The company’s most advanced product candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 is an investigational, novel, orally administered guanosine nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor – bemnifosbuvir.The company is also advancing a novel combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, an investigational nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor that it in-licensed from Merck MRK in December 2021 for the treatment of HCV.Atea made Merck an upfront payment of $25 million and is obligated to pay Merck milestone payments up to $135 million for certain development and regulatory milestones and up to $300 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain sales-based milestones.

163,02b27c41-7a82-3402-a4a9-46d4aa16202a,BA,2022-09-28,Insiders who placed huge bets on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) earlier this year would be disappointed with the 13% drop,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-placed-huge-bets-boeing-110054179.html,1664362854,STORY,['BA'],"[The recent 13% drop in The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA) stock could come as a blow to insiders who purchased US$1.1m worth of stock at an average buy price of US$209 over the past 12 months. Insiders invest with the hopes of seeing their money grow in value over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$699k, which is not what they expected.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$128). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.48k shares for US$1.1m. But insiders sold 990.00 shares worth US$220k. Overall, Boeing insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeBoeing is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Boeing insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$53m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boeing Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Boeing shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders own shares in Boeing and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Boeing. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Boeing that deserve your attention before buying any shares.But note: Boeing may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Forging a competitive domestic alternative will be difficult.Story continuesThe target of building 1,000 airliners by 2030 is ""basically impossible"", according to aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, managing director of U.S.-based AeroDynamic Advisory.""Even when they could get semiconductors and other vital components from the West, they were having a very hard time producing more than a handful of jets,"" he said.By comparison with the new seven-year goal, Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union had only ever built a combined total of around 2,000 large commercial jetliners, he added.When it comes to modern jets, Russia's only civilian planemaker, Rostec's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), is limited by a lack of models, manufacturing capacity and foreign components.Half of components and technologies used in the Russian aircraft industry in 2021 originated from foreign countries, according to a document titled: ""On the Strategic Directions of Activity in the New Conditions for the Period up to 2030"" prepared by the government and seen by Reuters.Rostec will have to find parts - or make them.""Our next goal is, in the shortest time, to complete import substitution of those imported parts which were delivered from abroad, for promising aviation projects - SSJ-New and MS-21,"" Rostec said.MADE IN RUSSIARussia plans to produce 20 fully import-substituted regional jets known as Superjet-New annually from 2024 and 72 new medium-haul MS-21 from 2029, beginning with six in 2024, according to the Russian aviation industry's development plan to 2030, published by the government in June.Russia is testing its new MS-21 plane with a domestically made PD-14 engine instead of the American-made PW1400G, supplied by Pratt &amp; Whitney.The MS-21 has been Russia's attempt to break into the main part of the jet market dominated by Airbus and Boeing.But it is struggling to replace the foreign components of its Superjet, including the SaM-146 engine which was designed by a joint venture with French engine firm Safran and could no longer be produced because of sanctions.UAC continues to produce Superjets with SaM-146's from stock and is going to deliver about 20 more jets with this engine, Rostec said.""They will be the last ones where our partner solutions with Safran are used. Then we will install PD-8 engines on this type of aircraft,"" Rostec said. PD-8 engines are also made in Russia.""From this year, we don't rely on international cooperation with Western countries,"" Rostec said. ""We can say with confidence that the MS-21 with American-made engines will not be delivered to the Russian market.""From 2022 to 2030 Russia plans to deliver 1,036 passenger planes. That includes 142 Superjet-New and 270 MS-21, as well as 70 turboprop Il-114, 70 medium-haul Tu-214, and 12 wide-body Il-96, designed locally, according to government documents.""We don't expect sanctions to be eased and we are building our plans based on the existing tough scenario,"" Rostec said.(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge, Matt Scuffham and Mark Potter)]"

167,4c74fecd-9754-32ea-80da-4e5c0ba9691a,BA,2022-09-28,WRAPUP 2-U.S. core capital goods orders surge; consumer confidence rises further,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wrapup-1-u-core-capital-134052856.html,1664286052,STORY,['BA'],"[(Adds consumer confidence, housing data, analyst comments)*Core capital goods orders increase 1.3% in August*Core capital goods shipments rise 0.3%*Consumer confidence index increases to 108.0 in September*House price growth decelerates in JulyBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-manufactured capital goods increased more than expected in August, suggesting that businesses remained keen to invest in equipment despite higher interest rates, which could keep the economy on a moderate growth path.Some of the largest gain in orders in seven months reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, however, reflected higher prices. The data suggested that business spending on equipment probably rebounded in the third quarter, further dispelling fears that the economy was in recession.That was reinforced by a survey showing consumer confidence rising for a second straight month in September, supported by a resilient labor market, which continues to churn out jobs at a brisk clip and generate strong wage gains, as well as falling gasoline prices. More consumers planned to buy big-ticket items like motor vehicles and household appliances over the next six months, which should help to underpin consumer spending.""It is hard to know whether companies are ordering up more widgets to produce the goods and provide the services for a stronger economy in the future or whether the jump in spending reflects the higher prices from inflation that remains out of control,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The economy may be more resilient than we think.""Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.3% last month. That was the biggest gain since January. Data for July was revised higher to show these so-called core capital goods orders gaining 0.7% instead of 0.3% as previously reported. The data is not adjusted for inflation.Story continuesEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.2%. There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals, computers and electronic products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But orders for fabricated metal products fell.Core capital goods shipments rose 0.3% after climbing 0.6% in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement.Business spending on equipment contracted by the most in two years in the second quarter. That together with a sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation resulted in GDP contracting at a 0.6% annualized rate last quarter after declining at a 1.6% pace in the January-March period.But the economy was not in recession in the first half, with the income side of the growth ledger showing moderate expansion. Goldman Sachs is forecasting GDP rebounding at a 1.2% rate in the third quarter.The economy is hanging on despite the aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation.The U.S. central bank last week raised its policy interest rate by 75 basis points, its third straight increase of that size. It signaled more large increases to come this year.Stocks on Wall Streets were trading lower after a brutal beating over the last six sessions. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices fell.TIGHT LABOR MARKETA second report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed its consumer confidence index rose to 108.0 this month from 103.6 in August, beating economists' expectations for a reading of 104.5. Households' worries about inflation eased, largely reflecting lower gasoline prices.Consumers' 12-month inflation expectations slipped to 6.8%, the lowest since January, from 7.0% in August.The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to 38 from a reading of 36 in August. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department and points to a still-tight jobs market.""The labor market differential suggests that joblessness fell in September, contrary to the Fed's goal of creating slack in the labor market to bring down wage growth,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.There were increases in the share of consumers planning to buy motor vehicles and appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and vacuum cleaners over the next six months. But consumers were less inclined to buy a house as soaring mortgage rates and still-high home prices eroded affordability.While a third report from the Commerce Department showed new home sales surged 28.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 units in August, that was likely due to builders offering incentives to clear inventory.With the 30-year fixed mortgage rate now at levels last seen during the Great Recession, the rebound in new home sales is likely temporary.There was, however, some good news for prospective buyers, who have been priced out of the market.A fourth report on Tuesday showed the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index increased 15.8% year-on-year in July, slowing from an 18.1% advance in June. On a monthly basis, prices fell 0.3% in July, the first drop since late 2018.The cooling house price inflation was corroborated by a fifth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices increased 13.9% in the 12 months through July after rising 16.3% in June. Prices fell 0.6% on a monthly basis.An outright house price collapse, however, is unlikely as housing remains in short supply.""Rapid home price deceleration was anticipated given the Fed's actions and will bring home price growth closer in line with income growth,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Returning to a long-term average of 4% to 5% annual price growth is closer than initially anticipated, potentially by early 2023.""(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)]"

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Southern could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Southern peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Southern.How Is Southern's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Southern's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 4.2% decrease to the company's bottom line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 33% in aggregate. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 14% per year as estimated by the twelve analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Southern is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Southern maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks.

It will also include support and resources for patients' caregivers through the Cigna Caregiver Bridge Program.Addressing musculoskeletal conditions through Pathwell Bone &amp; JointSMA recent study from the Evernorth Research Institute found that nearly one in four people seek care for ""wear and tear"" musculoskeletal conditions such as strains and sprains, and that these conditions drive significantly higher health care spending – accounting for nearly two-thirds of all musculoskeletal care utilization and spend.Pathwell Bone &amp; JointSM combines Cigna's national network of quality providers, personalized benefit designs, programs with whole-person support, access to behavioral health care, and physical therapy (digitally or in-person). Cigna's capabilities, combined with Evernorth's digital navigation tools and advanced predictive analytics that can anticipate a surgery up to a year in advance, create a holistic, integrated musculoskeletal solution that will improve health outcomes while reducing unnecessary surgeries that can lead to increased costs. If surgery is necessary, Cigna's benefit provides support with low or zero cost for surgery from admission through discharge. The Evernorth study also found that musculoskeletal spend can be reduced up to 40% with appropriate interventions and better-coordinated care – which is what Pathwell is designed to provide.The Cigna Pathwell suite of solutions is available to many U.S. commercial clients, and its availability will be expanded throughout 2023.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while BWX Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $14.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will provide tooling equipment to support the production of Lot 14 F-135 Propulsion Systems.The contract will cater to the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) participants. A major part of the work related to this deal will be carried out in LaPorte, IN; Syracuse, NY and Oxford, AL.F-35 &amp; Pratt and WhitneyOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted demand for defense products, with combat aircraft constituting a major portion of that portfolio.It is imperative to mention that the F-35 jets built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT enjoy a dominant position in the combat jet market. With F-35 being one of the top-notch stealth aircraft, Lockheed enjoys a consistent inflow of contracts for the production, delivery of associated spare parts and other deals concerning the F-35 jet program.For instance, in August 2022, the company won a significant contract worth $7.6 billion to procure a total of 129 F-35 aircraft, ranging from F-35A to F-35C variations. Such contract wins by Lockheed also benefit Pratt and Whitney, which supplies the F135 engine that powers all three variants of the F-35 fighter jets.Therefore, as the F-35 jet continues to dominate the combat aircraft market, Pratt &amp; Whitney stands to benefit from order flow. The latest contract win is an example of that.Growth ProspectsThe production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps. and Navy. Consequently, Pratt and Whitney is expected to witness more order inflows involving the F-35 program, like the latest one, which should bolster Raytheon Technologies’ top line.Besides Lockheed and Raytheon, Northrop Grumman NOC and BAE Systems Plc BAESY are also poised to gain from the solid production target for F-35, as both of them are key partners in the F-35 program.Story continuesNorthrop renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. Being a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft, Northrop has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft.Currently Northrop boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales indicates growth of 1.9% from the 2021 reported figure.BAE Systems’ short takeoff and vertical landing experience and air systems sustainment support F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, including a fully integrated radar warning, targeting support and self-protection to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.BAE Systems has a solid long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%.

""The leadership of City Council President Pro Tem Monica Montgomery Steppe and County Supervisor Joel Anderson and the collaboration among many organizations united in this effort have made this opportunity possible.""The grant to SDHC comes from Wells Fargo's Wealth Opportunity Restored Through Homeownership (WORTH) initiative, a $60 million national effort to address systemic barriers to homeownership for people of color. San Diego is one of eight markets across the U.S. to receive a WORTH grant. SDHC and RTF are among the organizations in the San Diego Homeownership Equity Collaborative, which will work to help create an estimated 5,000 new homeowners of color in San Diego County by the end of 2025.""As a company, we're committed to putting homeownership within reach for more families of color,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation. ""We recognize the need for deliberate intervention from the public and private sectors to address the homeownership equity gap. We look forward to working with the collaborative to accelerate actions and foster greater homeownership, wealth, and opportunity in San Diego.""Services and resources for homebuyers of color are expected to be developed, such as credit counseling, down payment assistance, and homeownership navigators. These will expand on the resources that are currently available to help more first‑time and first‑generation homebuyers. A list of current resources that are available to potential homebuyers, which will be updated, is available on SDHC's website at www.sdhc.org/homebuyerequity.Homeownership gapAccording to the Urban Institute study that SDHC commissioned, Latino households represented 19.1% of all households in San Diego, but only 13.6% of all homeowner households. Black households accounted for 6.1% of all San Diego households, but only 3.6% of all homeowner households in the City of San Diego.Nationwide, the Urban Institute estimates that without action, over the next 20 years, Black homeownership will continue to decline, and Hispanic homeownership will experience only slight increases. Gaps in homeownership rates contribute to differences in wealth among households. According to a Federal Reserve bulletin based on the Survey of Consumer Finances, the median net worth for a white family, which is $188,200, was approximately five times higher than for a Hispanic family, which is $36,100, and nearly eight times higher than for a Black family, which is $24,100. According to Urban Institute, home equity represents approximately 60% of total net worth for Black homeowners, compared with 43% for white homeowners. Homeownership provides households an asset that grows in value, can help pay educational expenses, may be used by family members to buy their own homes, or provides an inheritance for the next generation.Wells Fargo is working to increase racial equity in homeownership. Nationally, WORTH aims to help create 40,000 new homeowners of color by the end of 2025. Wells Fargo's $40 million Growing Diverse Housing Developers program is also working to expand housing inventory in communities of color, among other initiatives. The company also recently launched a Special Purpose Credit Program to help eligible minority homeowners whose mortgages are serviced by Wells Fargo lower their interest rates and reduce their monthly mortgage payments.About Wells FargoWells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth &amp; Investment Management.

The findings come over an 18 month stretch in a Phase 3 study of 1,800 patients with early-stage Alzheimers.Shares of Biogen surged nearly 50% in pre-market trading Wednesday on the development. The company's ticker page was the most active on Yahoo Finance ahead of the opening bell.“Today’s announcement gives patients and their families hope that lecanemab, if approved, can potentially slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, and provide a clinically meaningful impact on cognition and function,” Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos said in a statement.The FDA is currently reviewing whether to grant lecanemab conditional early approval.An estimated 6.5 million people in the U.S. age 65 and older are currently living with Alzheimer's, underscoring the sales potential for Biogen domestically alone.Bill McKay, 69, who has Alzheimer?s disease, and his wife Jill, 66, are interviewed using Zoom at their home in Haslett, Michigan, U.S. June 8, 2021. Reuters TV via REUTERSGuggenheim's Suneja thinks Biogen is primed to benefit from an approval of lecanemab, and the stock may have further room to run, though there is a caveat for investors: Biogen didn't create the drug alone.""With robust function data, approval of lecanemab as the first approved treatment for AD has the potential to reach the &gt;1M eligible patients,"" Suneja explained. ""If the company can secure rapid CMS reimbursement upon potential approval (this is likely based on the NCD coverage with evidence development memo), we estimate peak sales could be in the $6-8 billion. One caveat to this program vs. Aduhelm is that Eisai owns the asset and will record revenues globally (Biogen gets 45% profit split). ... Biogen and Eisai will co-promote lecanemab and share profits equally, which limits the peak opportunity to Biogen. Despite this, we believe lecanemab is worth ~$100-125/share toward our net present value for Biogen.""Story continuesBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Currently, a 30-µg booster dose of this vaccine is authorized for usein individuals aged 12 years and older.The bivalent vaccine contains 15-µg of an mRNA encoding the spike protein present in the original vaccine and 15 µg of an mRNA encoding the spike protein that is common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.Pfizer/BioNTech’s filing seeking authorization for using the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 booster in kids is based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine as well as pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. However, unlike all previously-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the data on the bivalent booster shot is not supported by data from any human clinical studies demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness.Pfizer/BioNTech have initiated clinical studies on the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine, though the results will not be available before some months.Shares of Pfizer have lost 25.8% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 5.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer/BioNTech also submitted a regulatory filing to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) seeking conditional marketing authorization (cMA) for their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine in individuals aged 12 years and older.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on PayPal Holdings'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PayPal Holdings is:10% = US$2.1b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.PayPal Holdings' Earnings Growth And 10% ROETo start with, PayPal Holdings' ROE looks acceptable. Even so, when compared with the average industry ROE of 18%, we aren't very excited. However, the moderate 20% net income growth seen by PayPal Holdings over the past five years is definitely a positive. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also provides some context to the earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesWe then compared PayPal Holdings' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PYPL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PYPL is currently mispriced by the market.Is PayPal Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Given that PayPal Holdings doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that PayPal Holdings' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

As organizations face skills gaps, security challenges and compliance obstacles, less than one quarter of respondents across the globe manage their hybrid cloud environments holistically – which can create blind spots and put data at risk.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)The IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud commissioned by IBM and conducted by independent research firm, The Harris Poll, was created to help organizations map their cloud transformation and empower them to self-classify their progress. Built on a foundation that leverages insights from experienced cloud professionals, enterprises can use the Index to gain measurable metrics that can help quantify their progress and uncover areas of opportunity and growth. The Index consisted of more than 3,000 business and technology decision-makers from 12 countries and across 15 industries including financial services, manufacturing, government, telecommunications and healthcare, to understand where organizations are advancing, or merely emerging, on their transformation journeys.The Index points to a strong correlation between hybrid cloud adoption and progress in digital transformation. In fact, 71% of those surveyed think it's difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without having a solid hybrid cloud strategy in place. At the same time, only 27% of those surveyed possess the necessary characteristics to be considered as ""advanced"" in their transformation. So, why the disconnect? A sampling of findings include:Story continuesCompliance: Businesses believe ensuring compliance in the cloud is currently too difficult – especially as we see enforcement of regulatory and compliance requirements heat up across the globe.Security: While businesses have embraced a variety of security techniques to secure workloads in the cloud, concerns about security still remain.Skills: As organizations face the realities of a talent shortage, they are failing to implement a holistic hybrid cloud strategy – which can create gaps in security and compliance and cause risk across cloud environments.""As we see regulatory requirements grow across the globe, compliance is top of mind for business leaders. This concern is even greater for those in highly regulated industries. Yet at the same time, they are facing a growing threat landscape – one that demands holistic management of their multicloud environments to avoid the risks of a Frankencloud – an environment that's so disconnected, it's difficult to navigate and can be nearly impossible to secure, particularly against third and fourth party risks,"" said Howard Boville, Head of IBM Cloud Platform. ""An integration strategy to bring together these different piece parts is what we believe separates the leaders from the rest of the pack – the alternative is to pay the price of the Frankencloud.""""The key value of cloud for businesses is rapid access to innovative technologies, data sources, and applications required to navigate current disruptions and transform businesses. No individual cloud can address all of an enterprise's requirements, so they must be able to use and effectively control hybrid cloud assets across many locations. IBM with its focus on providing a holistic hybrid cloud strategy is well positioned to help organizations address the security, data management and compliance complexities that can prevent them from taking full advantage of cloud innovation,"" says Rick Villars, Group Vice President of Worldwide Research at IDC.The 2022 IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud revealed:Lack of the right skills is inhibiting progress  When it comes to managing their cloud applications, 69% of respondents say their team lacks the skills needed to be proficient. This is a major roadblock to innovation, with more than a quarter of respondents saying skills and talent shortages are impeding their business's cloud objectives. The effects don't stop here – these limitations are also preventing organizations from leveraging the power of partnerships. More than one-third of respondents say a lack of technical skills is holding them back from integrating ecosystem partners into cloud environments. This challenge is even greater in the US, where nearly 40% admit to this lack of skills – pointing to the need for talent.Exposure to cyberthreats continues to lurk despite embracing security techniques While more than 90% of responding financial services, telecommunications and government organizations have adopted security tools such as confidential computing capabilities, multifactor authentication and more, gaps remain that are preventing organizations from driving innovation. In fact, 32% of overall respondents cite security as the top barrier for integrated workloads across environments and more than one quarter of respondents agree security concerns present a roadblock to achieving their cloud business goals.Security concerns can even hold organizations back from unlocking the full potential of partnerships. As potential security gaps can cause third and fourth party risks to loom, respondents say data governance (49%) and cybersecurity (47%) are the top challenges to fully integrating their business ecosystem into the cloud. In Brazil, cyberthreats are an even greater concern to ecosystem innovation -- 51% say cybersecurity risks pose a major challenge for businesses that want to integrate business ecosystem partners into cloud environments.Regulatory and compliance requirements remain center stage causing businesses to pause With regulations on the rise, so too are compliance challenges. 53% of respondents believe that ensuring compliance in the cloud is currently too difficult and nearly one-third cite regulatory compliance issues as a key barrier for integrating workloads across private and public IT environments. In financial services, for example, more than a quarter of respondents agree that meeting industry requirements is holding them back from fully achieving their cloud objectives. These challenges span the globe and are especially prevalent in countries such as Singapore, China, India and Japan.Based on the Index, IBM will launch an interactive tool to serve as a continual source of feedback for organizations to measure their transformation progress. With the ability to help companies assess how they fare against others, the tool will allow them to identify areas where transformation is stalled and where it may be excelling – unlocking the ability to diagnose and act with efficiency even against the real-world of complexity of cloud transformation.IBM will make the IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud tool publicly available in the coming months, aiming to provide business leaders with valuable benchmarking insights that can inform their hybrid cloud strategies. The IBM Institute for Business Value also published a new report, ""A Comparative Look at Enterprise Cloud Strategy"" with an action guide for how leaders can use the Index to help advance their organizations' digital transformation.Methodology: This survey was conducted online in 12 countries (US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Brazil, Spain, Singapore, Australia) by The Harris Poll on behalf of IBM from June 8th, 2022 to July 17th, 2022. The survey was conducted among 3,014 IT and business professionals in companies with annual revenue over $500M who have deep knowledge of their organization's Cloud strategy. The IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud was developed by combining the data from 25+ question batteries of various formats across 9 Cloud-related dimensions that were informed by input from industry experts.About IBMIBM is a leading global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting services provider, helping clients in more than 175 countries capitalize on insights from their data, streamline business processes, reduce costs and gain the competitive edge in their industries. Nearly 3,800 government and corporate entities in critical infrastructure areas such as financial services, telecommunications and healthcare rely on IBM's hybrid cloud platform and Red Hat OpenShift to affect their digital transformations quickly, efficiently, and securely. IBM's breakthrough innovations in AI, quantum computing, industry-specific cloud solutions and business services deliver open and flexible options to our clients. All of this is backed by IBM's legendary commitment to trust, transparency, responsibility, inclusivity, and service.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), since the last five years saw the share price fall 17%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 14% in the last 90 days.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the five years over which the share price declined, International Business Machines' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 12% each year. The share price decline of 4% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. The relatively muted share price reaction might be because the market expects the business to turn around.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, International Business Machines' TSR for the last 5 years was 10%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that International Business Machines returned a loss of 3.1% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 2% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for International Business Machines  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is potentially serious.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

MPC, Albemarle Corp. ALB, HF Sinclair Corp. DINO, Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA and Carlisle Companies Inc. CSL.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks with Solid Profitability Amid Recession FearsWall Street has witnessed its worst first half in 50 years this year. Thereafter, a two month-long impressive summer rally raised hope among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed's tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Inflation, Rate Hike and Recession ConcernsThe Fed, so far, has been unable to cool down inflation from a 40-year high despite adopting ultra-hawkish monetary stances. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% year to date, unseen since 1990.Moreover, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively. Market participants are now adjusting the cost of an imminent recession in the U.S. economy into stock markets' valuationAs of Sep 23, our projection has shown that the overall earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to grow 1.1% year over year. This indicates a stiff fall from 8.1% earnings growth year over year estimated in Jun 15. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have tumbled 10.3%, 10.8% and 12.2%, respectively, in the past month.Our Top PicksDespite this grim scenario, a handful of stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days.

202,fb09f7fe-7bea-3553-8af9-51232a119171,MPC,2022-09-28,"Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Spotlight on Deals by Equinor, Marathon",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-gas-stock-roundup-spotlight-121212563.html,1664280732,STORY,"['EQNR.OL', 'ENI.MI', 'CL=F', 'NG=F', 'MPC', 'EQNR', 'LNG']","[It was a week when oil prices settled below $80 for the first time in months, while natural gas futures hit their lowest point since July.On the news front, Norwegian energy behemoth Equinor EQNR signed a 10-year gas supply agreement with Poland, while oil refiner Marathon Petroleum MPC finalized its joint venture deal for the Martinez renewable fuels project in California with Finland’s Neste. Developments associated with Eni E, Cheniere Energy LNG and Schlumberger SLB also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a dismal seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 7.1% to close at $78.74 per barrel, while natural gas prices decreased around 12% to end at $6.828 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In particular, the oil and gas markets continued their rapid decline over the last few weeks.U.S. oil prices crashed following the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.Natural gas notched a bigger weekly loss, primarily due to a bearish inventory report. Unfavorable weather forecasts and a spurt in production were also blamed for pushing prices lower.Recap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories1.  Stavanger, Norway-headquartered integrated major Equinor signed an agreement to sell natural gas to Polish state-controlled PGNiG for 10 years. The pact is expected to improve the nation’s energy security after Russia cuts natural gas exports to countries in Europe this year.PGNiG is one of the leaders in the Polish natural gas market. The company’s core business includes the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil. The agreement, running from Jan 1, 2023, to Jan 1, 2033, involves the supply of 2.4 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year through the Baltic Pipe. The volumes are equivalent to 15% of the annual gas consumption in Poland.The Baltic Pipe pipeline will enable gas transport from Norway to the Denmark and Poland markets. Baltic Pipe is a gas infrastructure project aimed at creating a gas supply corridor in the Europe market. The pipeline is planned for partial commissioning this October. It is expected to be fully commissioned on Jan 1, 2023, at an annual capacity of up to 10 bcm. (Equinor Signs Deal to Supply Natural Gas to Poland)2.  U.S. downstream operator Marathon Petroleum declared that it has finalized the previously proposed joint venture with the Finnish oil refining and marketing company — Neste. The two firms will now hold equal shares in the joint venture, Martinez Renewables, to convert the Martinez refinery to produce renewable fuels.All necessary permits and regulatory approvals have been received for the project. Neste will invest a sum of $1 billion, including half of the total project development cost anticipated at around $1.2 billion, through the completion of the project. Meanwhile, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) MPC will be responsible for managing the completion of the conversion project along with the operation of the facility upon completion.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Currently, the first phase of the Martinez facility is targeted to be mechanically complete by the end of this year. The initial production capacity is estimated at 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels. Later, it will rise to its full nameplate production capacity of 730 million gallons per annum by year-end 2023. (Marathon, Neste Form Joint Venture for Renewable Project)3. Rome-based energy biggie Eni, through its Plenitude retail and renewable business, formed a partnership with Infrastrutture SpA to develop solar and wind power projects in Italy and Spain.Per the deal, Plenitude will acquire a 65% stake in energy developer and investor Infrastrutture’s subsidiary Hergo Renewables. Infrastrutture will hold the rest. Hergo Renewables holds a portfolio of projects in the two Mediterranean countries, with a total capacity of 1.5 gigawatts (GW).The first project involves a photovoltaic facility in Italy’s Montalto di Castro, with a capacity of 37 megawatts. The project’s work will begin in the coming weeks. The facility will likely be up and running in the second half of 2023. The partnership will enhance Infrastrutture’s proficiency and portfolio of projects built over its 30 years of industry experience in Italy and Spain. It will contribute to deploying renewable projects to fight against climate change. (Eni to Develop Renewable Energy Projects in Italy And Spain)4   Natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy and Whistler Pipeline have agreed to form a joint venture (JV) for the construction of the ADCC Pipeline. It is a 42-inch, intrastate pipeline that is anticipated to extend 43 miles from the terminus of Whistler Pipeline in Agua Dulce, TX to the Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas.The pipeline project, subject to customary regulatory and other approvals, is planned to be commissioned in 2024. It is expected to transport up to 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of (Bcf/d) natural gas and will be expandable to 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas. Moreover, the project involves the installation of three new compressor stations. These are planned to be commissioned in September 2023.The development comes at a time when demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG Quick QuoteLNG - Research Report) from Europe has skyrocketed as a result of Europe hustling to find alternatives to Russian gas. (Cheniere, Whistler JV to Construct Texas Gas Pipeline)5   Schlumberger, a leading provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells, collaborated with Gulf energy behemoth Saudi Aramco to develop a digital platform to provide sustainable solutions for industrial sectors, which are among the most challenging to decarbonize.The platform will enable industrial companies such as oil and gas, chemicals, utilities, cement, and steel to collect, measure, report and validate their emissions. It will also enable them to assess different decarbonization pathways.The companies will be able to measure and report baselines, targets, emissions, offsets and credits to manage their carbon footprints efficiently by increasing the availability and visibility of relevant data in a transparent and flexible solution. (Schlumberger, Aramco to Develop Low-Carbon Solutions)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.Company    Last Week    Last 6 MonthsXOM                   -8%                +0.7%CVX                    -7.5%            -14.5%COP                   -11.1%           -6.4%OXY                    -8.8%              0.0%SLB                    -8.8%              -19.9%RIG                     -22.1%           -49.3%VLO                    -3.7%              +3.4%MPC                   -4.4%              +11.2%With oil being deep in red for the week, stocks plunged too. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — was down 9.2% last week. Over the past six months, the sector tracker has decreased 10.7%.What’s Next in the Energy World?Following last week’s sliding fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the potential demand loss from the extended coronavirus lockdowns in China will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

203,8c4141c1-becc-3bc7-b232-af05d3ddeee2,MPC,2022-09-28,5 Value Stocks to Buy for Safety Amid Fed-Led Market Ruckus,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-buy-safety-121012663.html,1664280612,STORY,"['MPC', 'URI', 'CAR', 'UNM', 'DDS']","[September is historically known as the toughest month on Wall Street. This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock’s valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Dillard's Inc. DDS, United Rentals Inc. URI and Unum Group UNM.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Investors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.Story continuesWith respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAvis Budget Group provides car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. The ability of CAR to cater to a wide range of mobility demands helps it to expand and strengthen its global foothold through organic growth.Avis Budget Group operates through distinct global brands that focus on different market segments and complement other brands in their respective regional markets.

204,53f71233-d2d8-3cc6-9102-75944271464b,AES,2022-09-28,FirstEnergy (FE) Gains on Investment Amid Aging Infrastructure,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-fe-gains-investment-amid-141402321.html,1664288042,STORY,"['FE', 'LNT', 'AESC']","[FirstEnergy Corporation FE has been gaining from its transition to become a fully regulated utility company and systematic investments to strengthen infrastructure. Efficient debt management and the ‘Energizing the Future’ plan to expand transmission capability are likely to drive its performance over the long run.However, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to the aging infrastructure can adversely impact profitability. FirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FirstEnergy’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) suggests 5.3% growth from the 2022 estimated figure. Moreover, FE’s current dividend yield of 4% is better than the industry’s average of 3.2%.TailwindsStrategic investments help FirstEnergy serve its six million customers more efficiently. In the past several years, the regulated distribution segment experienced rate base growth through systematic investments.FE expects to invest $17 billion in the 2021-2025 period, of which $8.6 billion will be directed toward grid modernization and increasing resiliency, $1.7 billion for conservation and $6.5 billion for a clean energy transition and customer-centric growth projects. Strengthening transmission assets will allow the company to transmit electricity even during adverse weather conditions.FirstEnergy’s long-term debt and other long-term obligations as of Jun 30, 2022 were $20,763 million, down 6.7% from $22,248 million on Dec 31, 2021. The times interest earned (TIE) ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was 2.4. A TIE greater than one reflects the firm’s ability to meet debt obligations in the near future without difficulties.FirstEnergy is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In November 2020, it had updated the target to become 100% carbon neutral by 2050, with a mid-term goal of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level. Also, it plans to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2030 and further 100% by 2050.Story continuesHeadwindsAlthough FirstEnergy keeps investing in development opportunities to strengthen its transmission operations, the timely completion of projects within budget might not be possible.The existing coal-fired generating plants, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to the aging infrastructure and an adverse impact of severe weather conditions can lower energy deliveries, thereby impacting operating and financial results. To meet the conditions of stringent rules and regulations and maintain cyber security, FirstEnergy needs to bear additional costs.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of FirstEnergy have rallied 2.6% against the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry include The AES Corporation AES, AVANGRID Inc.

205,a0ab9ede-9d59-412e-8b1c-eebdd708d090,GM,2022-09-28,Tesla bear sees a 50% plunge in the stock,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citi-sees-plunge-in-tesla-stock-100540516.html,1664359540,STORY,"['F', 'TSLA', 'GM']","[One of the biggest Tesla bears on Wall Street is sticking with his views as rising global recession risks place potential pressure on the EV maker's top and bottom lines.Citi's Itay Michaeli maintained a sell rating on Tesla shares in a note out on Wednesday. Shares fell more than 2% in pre-market trading.Tesla's stock has been shrugging off the global economic concerns hammering markets, with shares of the EV maker up more than 20% in the last three months while the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 5%.The relative out-performance reflects optimism around new government legislation that will support the adoption of EVs in 2023 and beyond. Tesla's strong execution in the first two quarters of the year has also improved investor sentiment on the stock, which took a slight hit in August amid a broader market pullback.Michaeli thinks otherwise, however. Here are the details behind his call:Price Target: $141.33 (reiterated)Rating: Sell (reiterated)Stock price movement assumed: -50%Michaeli is marking down his third quarter production estimates on Tesla and highlights the potential for a disappointing fourth quarter from Tesla as economic pressures mount.""We now estimate Q3 deliveries at 369.8k units (398.5k prior) largely reflecting the production ramp at Shanghai. Our estimated Q3 deliveries incorporate strong demand but also some cushion for timing-related production/delivery variances. Given a number of production ramps this quarter and heavy reliance on September volume, there could be greater variance than usual in the Q3 delivery numbers. With production continuing to ramp into Q4, our 2022 deliveries estimate is intact (~1.4 million) since we regard the Q3 delta (vs. our initial estimate) as largely timing related. That said, we view the macro situation (particularly in Europe) as posing some risk to Q4 numbers.""Visitors look at a Tesla model during the 5th China International Industrial Design Expo in Wuhan International Expo Center on August 5,2022 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. (Photo by Getty Images)Tesla shares continue to be overvalued, Michaeli argues.""Our view is based on a risk/reward assessment, blending likely EV and AV/software outcomes. We currently believe that future bull case expectations appear too aggressive (Tesla selling ~20mln units by ~2030 &amp; soon achieving L4 RoboTaxi leadership), based on key data points we’re tracking. We are constructive on Tesla’s strong EV position and particularly the company’s improved execution in recent years.

Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley has stressed the importance of software-driven features and is hiring more executives with digital commerce experience.Ford will install 5G modems in 2023 model Super Duty trucks to enable services such as driver behavior monitoring and digital paperwork systems for fleet operators. Dashboards have been reprogrammed to make it easier for companies that install specialized equipment such as hoisting arms to connect controls for their gear into the truck's displays. Onboard scales will measure payloads and the new Super Duties will have more power plugs.The Super Duty, General Motors Co's rival Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD heavy duty pickups and heavy duty versions of Stellantis NV's Ram pickup are among the most profitable vehicles sold today by the Detroit Three automakers, or any rival.Ford said the Super Duty franchise generates ""more revenue than many Fortune 500 companies, including Southwest Airlines, Marriott International or Nordstrom."" Southwest reported $15.8 billion in revenue for 2021.Powered by big diesel or gasoline engines, Super Duty prices start at $41,240, but can range up to more than $100,000 for a fully loaded model.Heavy-duty pickups such as the Super Duty and Silverado HD do dirty work in oil fields and on construction sites. But many are sold to individuals who use them to tow large trailers, and want the same connectivity and comfort features they would expect in a luxury SUV. For now, battery electric powertrains cannot provide the same towing capability and driving range for heavy-duty pickups as combustion powerplants. Both Ford and GM are upgrading existing engines and transmissions, but not investing what it would take to develop new powertrains from scratch.Story continuesFord on Tuesday unveiled the latest generation of the Super Duty at Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, not far from the factory where most Super Duty trucks are built.Ford said Tuesday it will spend $700 million modernizing the Kentucky Truck plant, and expects to hire another 500 workers at the plant to support Super Duty production.One day ahead of Ford's Super Duty reveal, Chevrolet outlined a list of improvements to its Silverado HD heavy pickup line, which trails the Super Duty in sales.Chevrolet said it will now offer only a 10-speed Allison transmission on its heavy duty Silverado trucks. The 6.6 liter diesel engine's horsepower and torque get a boost, and certain models get upgraded interiors with bigger display screens. (Reporting By Joe White; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

But our next guest, though, says that there may be some relief on the horizon. We want to bring in Edmunds Executive Director of Insights, Jessica Caldwell. Jessica, it's great to see you here, so the cost of new cars obviously remaining high. We have started to see some relief when it comes to used cars. I guess, do you expect that relief to stick? And when should we expect to see the cost of new cars follow suit?JESSICA CALDWELL: Well, it's not, I would say, absolutely fantastic news. But what we have seen this year recently is a return to seasonality in the used car market because every year we see January used values are a little bit higher. And as the year goes on, they decrease. They get older. They have more miles, a little bit more wear and tear. So it makes sense that a vehicle, a used vehicle in September, is cheaper.However, that's not what we've seen in the past few years because the car market has been so topsy turvy. So I feel like that is the first good sign that things are sort of going back to normal. Things are-- cars, used cars, are still expensive if you compare them year over year. But at least we're not seeing that atypical nonseasonality phenomenon that we've had for the past few years.- And Jessica, it feels like we used to get bombarded with all these blockbuster sales for used cars and new cars. It doesn't feel like we get that as much. Is that going to come back at any point?JESSICA CALDWELL: It probably will come back. But I would say those blockbuster events-- I mean, right now we are in September. Usually this would be end of summer sales events. Model year sells down. Those are probably things that you remember. That doesn't have to happen because there's just no inventory to sell down at this point in time.Story continuesI just think that inventory will get better. Will it be as much as it once was, where there's just tons of options and every dealer is trying to undercut another dealer? I don't know if we're going to get to that. That seemed to be maybe an unhealthy place. But I think there'll be some it'll be somewhat in the middle. I mean, right now the inventory is far too few. But to go back to those days where the discounts were so heavy, I don't know if we'll exactly get back there.- The new car dealers I talked to love this dynamic, low inventory, high prices, lower employees. What's going to change this dynamic? And how essential is it for the Fed's fight against inflation?JESSICA CALDWELL: Yes. So I think for car dealers, this has been a good time. They've got high margins. They're not having to sell as many vehicles. They're not having to just work on volumes, which is a really stressful business of trying to make your number at the end of the month and all of that goes with it.But I think moving forward, there's just not enough vehicles for consumers. And that is an issue because consumers are walking to a different brand. They're trying to figure out if another car is going to work for them because either they don't want to pay the higher prices or they don't want to wait because that's a new thing too. Americans, we don't want to wait for our goods. We want them today, right now. And that is not happening either.So I think that this is probably not the system that is exactly ideal. So we probably are just going to have to keep, I would say, adding to the inventory, get it back to a normal level, where it's not as if you're going to lose customers because that really is the danger for auto companies, as well as dealers, is they're just going to walk because someone else can offer them a car in three weeks and maybe at MSP, versus waiting two months and a few thousand dollars over MSRP.- Jessica, how much of this is because of the-- when we talk about the increase in cost here, how much of it is because of the supply chain aspect of it, the fact that suppliers are raising their costs, and therefore some of these automakers are being forced to pass that along to the consumer?JESSICA CALDWELL: Yeah, I mean, there's probably a few dynamics going on. And one is consumer driven. Over the years, people, especially in this country, we've wanted larger vehicles. We want more options. As a result, a lot of companies, especially Detroit companies, they shuttered their smaller car lines. So that has naturally driven the price of vehicles up.And then we hit this supply shortage, mostly led by the semiconductors, which has made inventory really scarce. And I think that is what really has propelled these prices that we see above MSRP or at MSRP. And it's a little more atypical than what we've seen in the past.This industry has never seen an issue where inventory, not having enough inventory, is the problem. It's usually just sluggish consumer demand. That, of course, is not the case. But a part of these rising prices has been our own tastes. We like nice things. I think that's fairly typical of what we see when we look at cars around.- And so what are some of the trends that you're seeing in the leasing versus buying decision making?JESSICA CALDWELL: Right now the leasing market has really taken a hit. People are not necessarily as interested in leasing. A lot of leasing relies to get those low monthly payments that you've seen, the $499, $399 month. It relies on automaker incentives, either subsidizing the interest rate or the residual value. Automakers haven't had to do that right now because inventory is so tight, and people will just buy them outright.So as a result, the leasing isn't really good for consumers out there. So they're not leasing. Even brands that are normally used at such high rates, like the luxuries, like Audi or BMW, even those guys are not leasing very many vehicles because it just comes down to what just makes more sense. If you're going to pay such a high price, I'm just going to buy the vehicle.- Electric vehicles, stunning national average transaction is 61,955. Given gas prices are continually falling down and recessionary fears, what's likely to drive that supply back up? And what is the pricing action? Where are we headed with EVs?JESSICA CALDWELL: Yeah, I mean, the biggest issue with EVs is that automakers can't make enough of them. I mean, there's virtually waiting lists for nearly every EV on the market. I mean, some EVs, like the Ford F-150 Lightning, are so popular, I don't even think you can get on the wait list right now. You have to wait till the next model year comes out. So the issue I think is really supply.Of course, having a transaction price over 60,000 is not going to be the end goal for a lot of automakers. That is out of reach for a lot of American consumers. So the goal is to bring down the price in terms of product, really, so introducing less expensive vehicles, like we saw a few weeks ago at the Detroit Auto Show with the Chevy Equinox EV. That will be here. That's promised at $30,000.So I think for this market really to grow, the vehicles have to come down in cost. But it is a bit of a catch because the supply is so short, and it's going to be short because of some of the commodity issues that automakers are facing to build these vehicles.- Jessica, we did get news today, the Department of Transportation here approving the electric vehicle charging station plans for all 50 states. We know President Biden and his administration has been very ambitious in some of their EV goals. I guess, to what extent does this really move the needle?JESSICA CALDWELL: It definitely does because I think with EVs, it's sort of a chicken and egg. It's like, do people buy them first without charging? Or are chargers built first, and then people will buy them? So there always has been a lot of confusion. But what we know is that these two markets have to move in parallel.If people are going to buy EVs at high rates, California, for instance, saying that they're banning ICE sales by 2035, these charging stations are going to have to happen. And Americans do buy cars on the notion that they are going to drive one day across the country, even if we never do.So having that national infrastructure of charging is extremely important for people to make EVs their sole vehicle because right now we see EVs as a second or third vehicle. But to make it that person's only vehicle, this is going to have to happen. So I think a lot of things have to happen in this market for people to feel comfortable. But infrastructure is obviously a very crucial one.- It certainly is. All right, Jessica Caldwell of Edmunds. Thanks so much for joining us.]"

On Friday, GM announced plans to bring corporate workers back to physical locations at least three days per week later this year. After significant backlash from employees though, today, they walked back that plan, saying they won't be mandating specific in-office days, and they'll leave that up to the individual teams. GM said it will announce further updates by the end of next month after spending the next few weeks, quote, ""continuing to listen to feedback.""Now, Ford, on the other hand, has also updated its return policy, recently emphasizing their increased flexibility is what they think is a real advantage in hiring top talent. Shares of GM down more than 40% year to date and down today just about 1%. Were down much bigger earlier on.Overall, part of a much bigger discussion on return-to-office plans. And, clearly, right now, Rachelle, it looks like a tight labor market is going to win out because all these companies get out there; they announce these plans, and then they slowly walk them back over backlash. And that looks to be the deal until a recession, if a recession hits, and then we might see everyone return to office.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's true. Because we've seen the stick method, where they try and force you to come back. We've tried the carrot method, where they'll include all kinds of perks. They're like, oh, do you want to play pickleball? Do you want to do this?But, at the end of the day, from the surveys that I've seen from different work-from-home surveys, the main reason that people aren't coming back is because they have a lack of compelling reason to want to come back physically, if they're seeing that they're just as productive outside of the office. They're trying to find a reason to have to come back. And WFH Research actually found that just 49% of [? employees ?] who told them they had to return to the office full time, five days a week actually ended up turning up.Story continuesSo you can't really like reprimand or fire people in a labor market this type once you've really invested in them. So I don't think this is changing any time soon, until, as you mentioned, recession hits and the job losses become more severe and people really have to think twice about it. But at least for now, it does seem to be in the employee's favor, Seana.SEANA SMITH: I don't know. It could happen much sooner than we think if we do start hitting some of those unemployment projections that the Fed has said we certainly will see. They think we will see a slowdown in the labor market, in the jobs market. So, of course, that would give management at some of these companies an upper hand, because employees won't have too many options at least to go elsewhere for the time being.I still think this whole return-to-office saga, how it's playing out, is interesting to me, because it makes sense to be back in the office. I get the whole hybrid schedule. I get that maybe you only want to be back two or three days a week. That makes a lot of sense. But being back in the office is much more productive I think team-wise than everyone working from home, just in terms of the culture, building relationships, being able to have those one-off conversations, especially with your manager.That doesn't happen as often when you are working from home, at least when we were working from home for some time before we came back to the studio. So I think there is a reason-- I do think these managers have a point here in trying to get their workers back to the office, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: And, also, don't factor the-- the sideline deals. And I'm not just talking about big deals that are made like at conferences, but what happens on the sideline-- whether it's after work, getting a beer-- makes a huge amount of difference. Unfortunately, we can't have a debate here. We all kind of agree.Rachelle, get back in office. All right?SEANA SMITH: I know. Rachelle, you gotta move up--RACHELLE AKUFFO: Hey--SEANA SMITH: --here to New York.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Half the people say no thanks. So what can you do?]"

""We’re seeing demand not just among leisure travelers but also among corporate travelers, where in fact corporations want their employees in an electric vehicle to satisfy some of their own carbon footprint objectives.""Hertz inked a deal late in 2021 to purchase 100,000 Tesla Model 3s for its fleet by the end of 2022.

REUTERS/Yilei SunThe company aims to have 25% of its fleet be EVs by the end of 2024. Currently, about 5% of the fleet is electric, Scherr said.Given the influx of driver-friendly EVs and solid travel demand, Scherr struck an upbeat tone on the outlook for holiday season bookings.""Bookings have been positive out through the next couple of months, but equally... through the holiday period where it's proving quite strong,"" said Scherr, who took over as Hertz CEO earlier this year after many years in executive roles at Goldman Sachs.Hertz stock got a boost on Tuesday after the rental car company revealed a new EV charging station deal with oil giant BP. Shares were up more than 2% as of 2:00 p.m. ET.Hertz plans to have thousands of charging stations nationwide by the end of 2023 as part of the agreement, and Scherr stated he is on the hunt for similar charging station deals.""One of the real issues why engaging with BP is an important step is that not only are they going to build out charging stations — mostly fast chargers on our facilities — but we are going to use their energy management tools and software to sort of overcome range anxiety,"" Scherr said.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

212,6fa7f5ea-86c0-371a-bc44-edcf91ce2c3f,GM,2022-09-28,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-motors-130001873.html,1664283601,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this company have returned -11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.7% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 points to a change of -4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.52 indicates a change of -4.1% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $42.31 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +58%. The $154.24 billion and $164.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.5% and +6.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $35.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.35%. The EPS surprise was -17.99%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

218,0f83319d-71d9-3804-aa1e-14a113c724d0,PNC,2022-09-28,Sustainability a Win for PNC Client Berkshire Hills Bancorp,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainability-win-pnc-client-berkshire-132000424.html,1664284800,STORY,['PNC'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / September 27, 2022 / When unique business needs meet specialized capabilities, special things can happen. And that's exactly the scenario that led to a deal between PNC and Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.PNC Financial Services Group, Tuesday, September 27, 2022, Press release pictureBerkshire Hills Bancorp recently announced the completion of the public offering and sale of its inaugural sustainability bond - a $100 million bond issuance to help finance environmentally or socially conscious projects. PNC FIG Advisory, part of PNC Capital Markets LLC, acted as joint underwriter and coordinator for the offering. In addition, the firm was the sole Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) structuring agent on the transaction, leveraging experts from PNC's Sustainable Finance practice along with Berkshire's ESG leadership, to help to formulate the bond's sustainability performance targets, among other consulting services.What is a sustainability bond?A sustainability bond is similar to a regular bond that a financial institution - or an investor - ""buys"" from a borrower, also called an issuer or a seller. While the investor is technically ""buying"" the bond, it is basically another form of lending money. The bond seller must repay the amount of the loan by a specific date, including regular interest payments.The main goal of any bond is to help a borrower - usually a corporation or government entity - to finance specific projects and/or initiatives. The funds lent to the borrower are called ""bond proceeds,"" which are then used to accomplish those specific projects and/or initiatives.Simply put, what makes a sustainability bond different is that proceeds are used to help finance environmentally or socially conscious projects or activities such as:Third-party certified ""green"" building constructionRenewable energy productionAffordable housingDiversity and inclusion projectsThe projects aim to achieve predetermined goals tied to the bond's financing conditions and the borrower's goals.Story continues""As ESG activity becomes increasingly critical across the business landscape, PNC is committed to improving its ability to help clients better live their values and priorities,"" said Matt Resch, managing director for PNC FIG Advisory.One-of-a-kind opportunityBerkshire is the first public U.S. community bank holding company with under $150 billion in total assets to issue a sustainability bond and only the eleventh U.S. financial institution to issue an ESG-focused bond. This effectively puts Boston-based Berkshire Hills Bancorp in a league with institutions more than 20 times its size, including PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., which issued its first sustainability bond in 2019.Berkshire Hills Bancorp is undergoing a transformation as it looks to empower the financial potential of its communities. Under new leadership, there is renewed focus on its 176-year history in ESG and on the customer experience, so that it can deliver on the bank's vision to be a leading socially responsible community bank.""When we engaged with Berkshire Hills Bancorp about a year ago, it was a new relationship for PNC, and we knew they had debt scheduled to refinance in the near future,"" said Andrew Underwood, managing director for PNC FIG Advisory. ""We consulted with them about sustainable bonds because we knew it would fit well with their strategic business goals.""The team worked directly with Berkshire Hills Bancorp to create a sustainable financing framework that clearly defined eligible environmental and social investments aligned to Berkshire's specific ESG goals and objectives. This framework defines how the bond issuance will be used. The team also helped shepherd the framework through a third-party review, called the Second-Party Opinion.Berkshire Hills Bancorp's Sustainable Financing Framework is hyper-focused on building up communities across its footprint, seeking to create jobs and housing, and enhancing the viability of revitalization projects. Also, Berkshire will be focused on supporting small- to medium-sized enterprises, but not at the exclusion of investing in larger enterprises that may be critical to a specific region or area's job/food security.""We view our sustainable financing activities as a catalyst to deliver on our BEST Community Comeback and be an engine for positive change in our communities. As a result of this Sustainability Bond issuance, we'll support the clean-energy transition, help individuals achieve the dream of homeownership, expand services from small businesses and nonprofit organizations within low-to-moderate income neighborhoods and improve equity in our communities,"" said Gary Levante, Berkshire's head of ESG.Meeting client needsPNC launched its Sustainable Finance Practice in 2020 to better support clients with their own ESG-focused goals and initiatives.The Sustainable Finance Practice helps clients think through their own ESG strategies, goals and approaches, and structures financing that takes client goals into consideration by offering support for environmental and social debt issuances and sustainability-linked loans.""There are a few ways we can tailor financial solutions for clients with sustainability in mind - either making specific sustainability-focused purchases or investments or linking financial product pricing with sustainability performance,"" said Kristi Eberhardt, head of PNC's Sustainable Finance Practice. ""This work is only possible when we have deep engagement with our clients, knowledge of their goals, and strong expertise in ESG, both where it fits into the world now, and what we think it will look like in the future.""Why sustainability?The benefits of sustainable finance are far-reaching as efforts in this space can influence a multitude of business metrics such as stakeholder engagement, corporate social responsibility strategies, a company's investor base, and potentially a lower cost of capital, among others.Social responsibility is also a high priority for organizations. In a recent study by PNC's Institutional Asset Management group, 92% of all executives surveyed say that social responsibility is a priority for their organization. With PNC's experience in that space, its leadership feels the bank is uniquely positioned to help its customers forge their own path around sustainable financing.""PNC is leading the way with community banks and ESG,"" Underwood said. ""There have been two community bank sustainable-linked bond deals ever, and we've done both. But we know it's not just about the transaction, it's about a long-term relationship.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717604/Sustainability-a-Win-for-PNC-Client-Berkshire-Hills-Bancorp]"

( NYSE: PNC) announced that they have achieved the Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) Black Equity at Work Certification.PNC stepped forward as a launch employer in 2020 and is the first financial services institution to achieve certification. This milestone acknowledges PNC’s continued significant, beneficial progress toward diversity and inclusion in the workplace.The MLT Black Equity at Work Certification is a critical resource for employers committed to Black equity. It provides the clarity, guidance, and support employers need to make tangible progress. The plan approval process helps employers develop robust, comprehensive plans to achieve certification in one to three years. The certification also provides broad-based recognition, enabling employers that take meaningful actions toward Black equity to stand out.“Achieving certification demonstrates that PNC is on the right course, but this is not the finish line,” said PNC’s Chief Diversity Officer, Gina Coleman.“We remain focused on and committed to continued progress. We have a responsibility to our employees, stakeholders, and the community to continue our journey toward equity, with the goal of being a better company, better employer, better neighbor, and better investment.”The Certification focuses on People, Purchasing and Philanthropy, and centers on five Pillars:– Representation– Compensation– Workplace Culture– Business Practices– Contributions and Investments“Becoming Black Equity at Work Certified requires a rigorous, comprehensive approach to moving the needle on racial equity. On behalf of MLT, I applaud PNC for reaching this milestone, and am grateful for our 10+ year partnership,” said John Rice, founder and CEO of Management Leadership for Tomorrow.The two-step process to achieving certification includes a comprehensive measurement framework, requirement of rigorous action, hands-on support, and accountability for achieving and sustaining measurable results, according to a press release. During step one, employers develop a comprehensive plan to make progress in each of the five pillars of the MLT Black Equity at Work Certification scorecard. Once the plan is approved, employers have up to three years to achieve the minimum qualifying score to become MLT Black Equity at Work Certified. The Certification framework was carefully crafted by MLT with support from Boston Consulting Group to strike the balance between rigor and achievability.“What gets measured is often what gets done, and we’re proud to see that our results indicate meaningful progress,” said Vicki Henn, PNC chief human resources officer.“This accomplishment represents the work being done every day across PNC’s footprint. We are optimistic that our comprehensive efforts, embedded into our business practices, will continue to move the needle toward equity.”]"

221,369077a0-9a9f-34c6-a7d1-59c79570fc14,TGT,2022-09-28,Target's (NYSE:TGT) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/targets-nyse-tgt-five-total-120139508.html,1664366499,STORY,['TGT'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) share price has soared 153% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's down 7.2% in the last seven days.In light of the stock dropping 7.2% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. Check out our latest analysis for Target To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 20% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 187% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Target shareholders are down 35% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 23% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Target  you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Players in the industry are all geared up to walk the extra mile this holiday season to capitalize on any surge in demand. However, supply-chain issues and rising freight charges are headwinds that the industry is currently struggling with, but retailers remain hopeful of a fabulous festive season.The holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues, is a make or break for retailers. Hence, retailers need to address any logistical or inventory issues and roll out strategies to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether offline or online. Keeping all these aspects in mind and to keep pace with any unprecedented increase in demand, retailers are unveiling hiring plans for the holiday season.Considering consumers’ product preferences, retailers need to replenish shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramp up investments in digitization. These will result in the deployment of a reasonable number of seasonal associates to deal with the curbside and in-store pickup of online purchases as well as doorstep delivery. Also, retailers are likely to appoint more warehouse staff to ensure the smooth supply of inventories to stores from distribution centers during the festive period.Retailers on a Hiring SpreeThe retail behemoth, Walmart WMT, plans to hire about 40,000 workers, including seasonal and full-time. The company will also offer additional hours to its existing workers. The job roles include seasonal store associates, full-time permanent truck drivers and customer care associates.Walmart is making solid price investments across key categories to offer great value to its customers. It is also offering more rollbacks to boost savings on gifts like toys, electronics, beauty and home, to name a few. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also making efforts to ease the returns process, as part of which it announced that Walmart+ members can avail of new return options, including Holiday Guarantee, Curbside Returns and Return Pickup from Home, starting October.Meanwhile, Target Corporation TGT plans to appoint up to 100,000 seasonal workers to better serve its guests and provide a seamless shopping experience. To make the most of the festive season, this Zacks Rank #3 company is back with its “Deal Days” and Price Match Guarantee.Through its “Target Deal Days” shopping event, it will offer guests the best deals on must-have items and everyday essentials. Interested customers can access amazing deals from Oct 6 to Oct 8. To attract deal seekers, Target is offering “Holiday Price Match Guarantee”, starting Oct 6. The program will run through Dec 24.Keeping in mind the festive rush, Macy’s M plans to fill more than 41,000 full and part-time seasonal positions. Recruitment will be done at its Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, supply-chain locations and call centers.Macy’s has undertaken initiatives to better engage with customers and gain market share. The company believes that the Polaris Strategy positions it well to navigate through the dynamic retail landscape. This Zacks Rank #3 company is on track to strengthen its omnichannel capabilities with investments in online shopping experiences, data and analytics, technology infrastructure as well as better fulfillment capabilities.DICK'S Sporting Goods DKS plans to appoint up to 9,000 seasonal associates for the 2022 holiday season. Favorable customer demand, a solid product portfolio and strength in the online platform have been contributing to DICK'S Sporting Goods’ upbeat performance. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company remains optimistic about demand trends in athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wrapping UpWhile inflation may play a spoilsport, we still believe that stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate should help keep demand alive.

(NASDAQ:ADI) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 38.6x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Analog Devices could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Analog Devices.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Analog Devices' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 20%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 8.7% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 27% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Analog Devices' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Analog Devices' P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Analog Devices' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for Analog Devices that you need to take into consideration.You might be able to find a better investment than Analog Devices.

Here are two companies that fit this description: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Visa (NYSE: V). Microsoft squarely features on the list of companies whose services people use every day.Continue reading]
229,84d0d855-f197-390b-8fcc-f42b53e1b983,V,2022-09-28,Institutional owners may consider drastic measures as Visa Inc.'s (NYSE:V) recent US$29b drop adds to long-term losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-consider-drastic-120201713.html,1664366521,STORY,['V'],"[A look at the shareholders of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.4% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 21% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Visa which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Visa. View our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Visa. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Visa. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.0% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of VisaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Visa Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$183m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

230,71592eaa-b6e6-3d90-b213-57d1a1c72f92,V,2022-09-28,Visa (V) Declines for 10 Straight Days: Should You be Worried?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-v-declines-10-straight-154203781.html,1664293323,STORY,"['V', 'MA']","[Visa Inc.’s V shares fell 1.8% yesterday, recording 10 straight days of decline. This marks its longest losing streak since it recorded nine straight days of loss in 2013, per MarketWatch. During the 10 sessions, V’s shares fell 12.6%. There are multiple factors that might be shaking investors’ confidence, leading to the persistent decline.Visa Inc. PriceVisa Inc. PriceVisa Inc. price | Visa Inc. QuoteThe growing economic concerns, fueled by high inflation, increasing interest rates and the resultant upset in consumer spending might have spooked the investors, despite Visa’s reassuring spending trend reports. It reported encouraging payment volume growth for July and August. If this trend continues, Visa is likely to register a significant year-over-year increase in volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Another factor that might have alarmed investors is the recently proposed bill by the Congress to enhance competition within credit card processing firms. The Credit Card Competition Act of 2022 is expected to reduce the dominance of Visa and Mastercard Incorporated MA in the processing space and save money for merchants and consumers. This can reduce swipe fees for V and MA, putting pressure on their margins.While Visa registered 10 straight days of share price decline, Mastercard witnessed an eight-day-long losing streak, wherein it lost 11%. This marks MA’s longest losing streak since the 10-day-long losing streak in 2008. Now, beyond the share price declines, the question is whether the two companies can keep their growth momentum steady. If yes, then the share price will jump back up again.What the Future Holds?Both Visa and Mastercard enjoy a massive chunk of the market. While growing competition and lower fees might reduce their potential profit margin, their rising transaction volumes can offset the negatives. The coming holiday season is expected to witness a surge in consumer spending, which will benefit both companies.Story continuesAlso, with their massive size, Visa and Mastercard invest huge amounts of money in technology, security, research and development. Even if competition rises in the coming days, the competitors are not expected to provide the same level of security in transactions for consumers and merchants. With the rising threat to digital transactions, clients will likely keep choosing companies that can provide maximum security.Visa continues to invest in technology to further boost its already leading position in the payments market and minimize the impact of fraud, and protect consumer and merchant information. Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company in recent years to advance its digital platform.Visa is expected to witness growth in the days ahead due to its attractive core business that continues to be driven by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksVisa currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

231,2dca7f4e-73c9-367a-987a-f5c75eb58c3a,V,2022-09-28,Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks are Holding Up in Bear Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-4-dow-finance-stocks-134801986.html,1664286481,STORY,"['GS', 'AXP', 'V', 'JPM', '^DJI', 'GSBD']","[The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index has slipped into the bear market. Following yesterday’s decline of 1.1%, the index is now down 20.5% from its Jan 4 peak (hence meeting the definition of a bear market).Worries that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance to fight decade-high inflation will push the U.S. economy into a downturn have weighed on investor sentiments since the beginning of 2022. This has sent the domestic equity markets tumbling after a solid performance last year.The Dow, the 30-stock blue-chip index, rallied almost 19% in 2021. But macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have led to a pessimistic stance since the start of this year. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP – that are part of the index.So far this year, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP have plunged 32.6%, 23%, 16.7% and 16%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in quality franchises.Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the central bank’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the coming six-nine months remain a big headwind. Until now, consumer confidence and spending are holding up well, but with the steady rate increase, these are likely to witness weakness.Hence, investors are shying away from stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The company has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of the competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, which will strengthen its operations through technological advancement.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2022, total loans grew 6% year over year to $1.1 trillion.While higher rates and the expected global economic slowdown will continue hampering investment banking (IB) business, JPMorgan’s leading position in garnering global IB fees will offer leverage. Also, ongoing macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions should keep the markets volatile in the quarters ahead, helping the company earn measurable trading revenues (which account for almost 25% of its total net revenues).Also, JPM currently pays investors $4.00 per share as an annual dividend, which yields 3.66%. The company increased its dividend four times in the past five years, and its payout grew 14.82% over the same time period. JPM's payout ratio is 32% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past week.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses, while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In April 2022, this Zacks Rank #3 company acquired Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, while in March, it closed the acquisition of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, it completed the purchase of Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Further, its asset management division has announced a deal to acquire robo-advisor NextCapital.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first half of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Backed by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share in July. Prior to this, it announced a dividend hike by 60% to $2 per share last year.Based on the dividend paid out over the trailing four quarters, GS has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In the last five years, the company has increased its dividend five times, with an annualized growth rate of 25.7%. Further, the company’s payout ratio is 18% of earnings.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 8.66, which is lower than the industry average of 12.45. Also, its P/B ratio of 0.96 is below the industry average of 1.54.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay, and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space. It consistently made efforts to expand its presence in Latin America, South Africa and Europe.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been witnessing tremendous revenue growth on the back of expanded payments volume and the number of processed. The trend will continue, driven by its strong market position and an attractive core business supported by new deals, renewed agreements, accretive acquisitions, increasing spending via cards, shift to the digital form of payments and expansion of service offerings.V enjoys compelling cash and available-for-sale investment position along with a healthy free cash flow, which enables it to make acquisitions and fund capital expenditure. Backed by its strong cash position, it remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value. Visa has increased its dividend each year since 2009, with the latest being a 17% hike in October 2021 to 37.5 cents per share. The stock has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 16.6%. Further, the payout ratio of V is 21% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has moved marginally upward, while that for 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.American Express, one of the leading providers of credit payment card products, is expected to witness a solid revenue rise driven by several growth initiatives, such as launching products, enhancing the existing features, modifying prices, reaching agreements and forging alliances, among others. Even though the COVID-led fall in business volumes hampered its top line in 2020, the same has been picking up gradually on rebounding economic growth and increasing consumer spending.With its new growth plan, AXP anticipates gaining solidly from the improving macro environment. Rising credit card spending will boost its future performance. Management expects revenues to increase 23-25% this year, with the target to achieve growth of more than 10% over the long term.This Zacks Rank #2 company is working to provide digitized services to its customers. It has acquired a number of digital companies in the past, which along with new digital features and content that American Express is building in-house, will enable its card members to engage more and thus, drive card usage volumes and revenues.Further, American Express made a significant move in small business banking by acquiring Kabbage, an online lender, in 2020. Since then, the company has been expanding the services offered by Kabbage, which will help rapidly grow its business in the domestic market and diversify revenue sources. The company also forms strategic partnerships with Delta, Hilton and Amazon. It recently announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard.The company has robust cash-generating abilities in place through which business investment and prudent shareholder-friendly moves are undertaken. This March, the company announced a hike of around 20% in the quarterly dividend to 52 cents per share. The company has a dividend yield of 1.48% and five-year annualized dividend growth of 7.2%. Further, AXP's payout ratio is 21% of earnings at present.Also, American Express currently has a Value Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged over the past seven days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This approach enabled a further calculation of each act’s cost-benefit ratio, or overall ‘cost-effectiveness.’ To inspire participation in National Neighbor Day, the following insights reveal the overall ‘Kindest Acts’ one can plan to do for their neighbors:Top 10 Overall Kindest Acts to Do for NeighborsPay for a neighbor’s groceries at the supermarketDonate money to a neighborDonate diapers to a neighborBuy extra school supplies for a neighborRemind a neighbor that they matterAccept a neighbor as they areOrganize or join local park and beach clean upsTell a neighbor what a positive difference they made to someone else’s lifeMow the lawn for a neighborSurprise a neighbor with their favorite thingsDelving further into the perceived balance of cost and benefit, the research also defined the most cost-effective acts of kindness for neighbors, revealing the high value of gestures that come from the heart rather than the wallet.Story continuesTop 10 Most Cost-effective Kind Acts to Do for NeighborsCompliment a neighborRemind a neighbor that they matterAccept a neighbor as they areTell a neighbor what a positive difference they made to someone else’s lifeDonate items they no longer need or useWrite a list of lovely things about a neighborArrive at meetings with a neighbor on timePray for a neighborReturn a borrowed book to a neighborBring attention to the accomplishments of a neighbor""As communities are navigating inflation and economic challenges, these findings are a clear reminder that simple acts of kindness come at little cost, and are a powerful way to strengthen our neighborhoods,"" said Sarah Friar, Chief Executive Officer, Nextdoor. ""Offering a thoughtful word or simply reaching out to your neighbor builds important connections in our communities so that everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.""""We all have the capacity for kindness – but we don’t always act on it,"" said Krista Bourne, chief operating officer of Verizon Consumer Group. ""We hope the results of this research will showcase just how easy and cost effective it is to be kind - and for people to take action. Whether you are at the store, at work or in your neighborhood, we can all use a little more kindness.""""Kindness is a great way to kickstart cooperative relationships with neighbors. We hope these recommended acts of kindness will help make everyone’s community a kinder place to be,"" said Dr Oliver Scott Curry, Chief Science Officer for kindness.org.Today’s Neighbor Day insights come at the end of a month-long initiative: The Big Neighborhood MeetUp. Throughout September, Nextdoor and Verizon hosted free all-age events in neighborhoods in Chicago, Houston, Raleigh and Oakland for an afternoon of fun, food, games, and reconnecting with their community. These inspired tens of thousands of people nationwide to join the ‘MeetUp’ movement by creating their own events and activities within their own neighborhoods. From simple coffee dates to full-fledged festivals, these home-grown MeetUps showcased the flavor and personality of their communities, including backyard BBQs, outdoor concerts, sports viewing parties, game nights, community garage sales and many more.Additionally, the two companies will bring a fifth #BigNeighborhoodMeetUp to New York’s Advertising Week, with a luncheon and panel discussion on October 19th diving deeper into these insights and the impact of kind acts on building stronger, more connected communities.To learn more about the Nextdoor and Verizon commissioned study with Kindness.org, visit Nextdoor’s Insights Hub at https://business.nextdoor.com/en-us/enterprise/insights.

The demonstration at Lockheed Martin’s 5G test range in Waterton, Colo. showcases the power of millimeter wave 5G networks to move data from aircraft in flight over Lockheed Martin’s multi-site, multi-vendor 5G.MIL pilot network.The companies demonstrated two key advances in technology that can provide critical applications to the Department of Defense (DOD).To provide enhanced situational awareness and command &amp; control (C2) for commanders and service members in the field, the first test involved real-time ISR radio frequency (RF) and streaming video data transmitted over 5G millimeter wave links. This allows advanced signal processing algorithms to occur at the tactical edge. The low latency and reliability provided by the Verizon network was critical in being able to process this data in close to real time, which was displayed in a livestream video feed.The second test demonstrated the technology’s ability to passively detect and geolocate RF signals that could be used for communications, sensing, or jamming, capabilities that will enable the DOD to detect and target adversarial assets in a military environment.“To stay ahead of our adversaries, military decision-makers need the timely and accurate information that 5G.MIL delivered in this demonstration,” said Dan Rice, vice president of 5G.MIL Programs at Lockheed Martin. “By blending advanced commercial 5G capabilities with military capabilities using secure, open standards, we are helping to make the DOD’s vision for integrated deterrence a reality.”Story continues“Verizon is the network America relies on, and our Private 5G Ultra Wideband networks provide the security, reliability, capacity and low latency that the defense sector depends on,” said Srini Kalapala, Senior Vice President for Technology and Product Development at Verizon. ""By demonstrating the mission critical connectivity that our network provides, we are demonstrating how 5G and edge computing can help the DOD address their strategic priorities and continue to develop advanced solutions.”For this latest 5G-enabled drone demonstration, Lockheed Martin flew four rotary wing drones on coordinated ISR missions while linked to two Verizon On Site Private Network nodes, which enables the secure transfer of ISR data. The companies then seamlessly and securely moved the data captured by the drones between a 5G private network and a surrogate public network. The ability to use private and public 5G networks is key because it will extend the reach of 5G.MIL technology to a range of military environments where commercial networks may not be available or appropriate.The drones then successfully located a target in the field that was transmitting a low power RF signal. The signal was detected because real-time drone sensing data was transmitted over the Verizon network and then processed by advanced signal processing algorithms running on edge compute resources, enabling geolocation of the signal source.This demonstration follows Lockheed Martin’s and Verizon’s announcement last year of a formal partnership focused on faster delivery of cutting-edge technologies to the DOD. The companies have already conducted a joint demonstration using a Verizon private 5G network installed at Lockheed Martin Space’s 5G Test Range in Colorado, and future demonstrations will expand ISR test scenarios to include precision geolocation of moving RF emitters and extend experimentation of public-private secure interoperability in 5G.MIL hybrid networks with military data links.For more information, visit www.lockheedmartin.com/5G and http://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g.Verizon Communications Inc.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Stanley Black &amp; Decker How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stanley Black &amp; Decker is:10% = US$941m ÷ US$9.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.Does Stanley Black &amp; Decker Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Stanley Black &amp; Decker has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the Machinery industry (13%).roeThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Stanley Black &amp; Decker by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Stanley Black &amp; Decker's Debt And Its 10% Return On EquityStanley Black &amp; Decker does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.23. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

252,88d49cc9-a8bd-4fda-8b69-b1621dd36639,NVDA,2022-09-28,Intel debuts new 13th-generation chips to take on AMD amid PC sales slump,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-debuts-new-13-th-generation-chips-162010182.html,1664295610,STORY,"['AMD', 'INTC', 'QCOM', 'NVDA']","[Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger debuted the company’s 13th-generation Intel Core processors on Tuesday during the chip giant’s annual Intel Innovation event in San Jose, California.The new chips, codenamed Raptor Lake, are designed to put Intel in the performance lead ahead of arch rival AMD (AMD) in the desktop performance space. They also come as PC sales slump following massive growth during the early days of the pandemic.Intel says the top-of-the-line version of the chip, the Core i9-13900K, is the fastest desktop processor on the planet. The chip, which is being marketed towards hardcore gamers and creators, packs a whopping 24 processing cores. Those are broken down into eight performance cores and 16 efficiency cores.The performance cores for the new chip are designed to handle your heavy-duty tasks — think gaming, compiling code, and helping with photo and video editing. The efficiency cores are meant to handle less intensive tasks like web browsing, firing off emails, etc. The idea is that your computer can call on the performance cores when it needs some extra horsepower — and rely on the efficiency cores when you’re doing basic tasks and don’t need to drain your neighborhood’s power grid.Intel says its new 13th-gen chip is a beast for gamers and creators. (Image: Intel)“The 13th Gen Intel Core family is the latest example of how Intel is enabling amazing experiences to happen on the PC — at scale and across all PC product segments,” Intel Client Computing Group general manager Michelle Johnston Holthaus said in a statement.The company’s big boast is that the Core i9-13900K chips' speed tops out at a ridiculous 5.8Ghz. That’s important, because it just beats out AMD’s top-of-the-line AMD Ryzen 9 7950X chip, which reaches a speed of 5.7GHz.Of course, most people are unlikely to snag the Core i9-13900K, as it will likely be out of most users’ price ranges. We’re still expecting exact pricing on the chip, but based on past precedent, expect it to be around the $700 range.For those looking for something a bit more wallet-friendly, Intel will also have the usual Core i5 and Core i7 chips, which get performance gains over their 12th-generation predecessors. In total, Intel says the 13th-generation line-up will have 22 processors and be available across 125 partner system designs.Story continuesIn addition to the company’s 13th-generation chips, Intel announced its new Intel Unison software. Designed to better connect your smartphone and your PC, Unison promises improved file transfer capabilities for iOS and Android devices. The company also says you’ll be able to receive text messages, calls, and notifications from your Android phone on your PC.Intel's Unison software is designed to improve communication between your PC and smartphone. (Image: Intel)This isn’t the only software with these kinds of options. Microsoft offers a similar app, though it only works with Android devices. Apple already allows iOS users to make and receive calls, and to send and receive texts from the iPhone on their Macs. Those users can also start apps on their iPhone and pick up where they left off on their Macs.Intel’s announcements come at a critical time for the company. Gelsinger is trying to return Intel to its position as the world’s preeminent chip designer and builder. But it’s going to be a difficult journey as the company contends with rivals like AMD, Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia on the design side and TSMC on the manufacturing side.Intel reported dismal results in the second quarter, missing expectations and pointing to problems with its execution and falling demand for server chips. At the time, Gelsinger announced that Intel would miss its annual sales revenue by as much as $11 billion. The stock is currently hanging on just above its 52-week low of $26.81.“This quarter’s results were below the standards we have set for the company and our shareholders. We must and will do better. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver, but the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues,” Gelsinger said at the time.“We are being responsive to changing business conditions, working closely with our customers while remaining laser-focused on our strategy and long-term opportunities. We are embracing this challenging environment to accelerate our transformation.”Shares of Intel are down 47% year-to-date. AMD is off as much as 53%, while Nvidia is down 58%.Will Intel be able to turn things around? That depends on whether the company can meet its ambitious goal of becoming the chip powerhouse it once was and how long the economy will continue to struggle.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanMeta is desperate to fight back against Apple’s privacy changesApple AirPods Pro add better sound, improved controls to Apple’s best earbudsWindows 11 PC is getting a ton of updates, including live captions, gaming upgradesGot a tip?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.26 = US$9.4b ÷ (US$43b - US$7.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).Therefore, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 26%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NVIDIA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is NVIDIA's ROCE Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like NVIDIA. The company has consistently earned 26% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 328% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Bottom Line On NVIDIA's ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 176% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

PKI recently launched a unique benchtop platform, Cellaca PLX Image Cytometry System. The system is expected to enable researchers to evaluate multiple Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of cell samples in a single automated workflow, including cell identity, quality and quantity.The innovative Cellaca PLX system has been designed by PerkinElmer’s Nexcelom unit and combines superior image cytometer hardware, software, validated consumables and trackable data reporting all in one system without needing further adjustments. Optimized reagent kits with validated antibodies from PerkinElmer’s BioLegend business are also part of the proprietary solution to further streamline the customer experience.The latest launch will likely enable PerkinElmer to significantly strengthen its Life Sciences business unit in the broader Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions segment.Significance of the LaunchThe latest offering is expected to provide researchers with expanded cell sample CQA analysis options beyond flow cytometry and staining methods. This compares to historical approaches, which have required a variety of different instruments and analytical methods. By combining these capabilities, researchers will now be able to detect multiple markers simultaneously (multiplexing) and perform immunophenotyping and viability assays in a few seconds with an easy-to-use and modern user interface.Per the management, despite pharmaceutical companies investing heavily in cell and gene therapy, they struggle to evaluate the complex cell samples needed to meet huge scientific demands and regulatory rigor across their research and manufacturing processes. The management believes that although the Cellaca PLX Image Cytometer platform is therapeutic area agnostic, it is expected to be especially beneficial for researchers working in CAR-T cell therapy who want to streamline their phenotyping of immune cells for downstream processes.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets published on GlobeNewswire, the global cell and gene therapy market is expected to grow from $6.58 billion in 2021 to $21.33 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 25.6%. Factors like increasing incidences of rare and chronic diseases, advancements in cell and gene therapy, and a rising number of clinical trials are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen PerkinElmer’s global business.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, PerkinElmer’s Oxford Immunotec recently announced that the FDA had approved the use of the T-Cell Select reagent kit to automate its T-SPOT.TB test workflow for in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) use by certified laboratories.Last month, PerkinElmer announced its second-quarter 2022 results, registering a solid non-COVID organic growth. During the reported quarter, the company entered into an agreement to divest its Applied, Food and Enterprise Services businesses to New Mountain Capital. The transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.In July, PerkinElmer announced that a placental growth factor (PlGF) measurement using its DELFIA Xpress PlGF 1-2-3TM kit (CE-IVD) and a soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1)/PlGF ratio using its DELFIA Xpress sFlt-1 kit (CE-IVD), have been included in an updated diagnostic guidance issued by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to help diagnose suspected preterm pre-eclampsia.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 30.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 28.4% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 17.1% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, PerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Yet, concerns related to regulatory headwinds and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 46.4% compared with 50.6% decline of the industry and 17.1% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) technology provider has a market capitalization of $408.9 million. Surmodics projects 135.2% growth for fiscal 2023, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 41.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon (DCB) program deserve a mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.During the third quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call in July, Surmodics confirmed that it is currently assessing the next steps for the clinical development and future commercialization of the Sundance DCB, for which a multinational strategic partner has expressed interest.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. Surmodics’ Product Sales of its medical devices in the fiscal 2022 third quarter grew 64% year over year, including contract manufactured balloon catheters, specialty catheters partnered with Cook and Medtronic, and its Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy and Sublime Radial device products. Surmodics’ Medical Device business product revenue grew 23% on broad-based growth across Medical Device products and coating reagents with growing contribution from the Pounce Arterial and Sublime Radial commercialization efforts.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Surmodics’ better-than-expected earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2022 buoy optimism about the stock. Its quarterly revenues were also in line with management expectations. The company registered robust Product sales growth on the back of continued demand for its medical devices and IVD products. Surmodics confirmed making crucial progress on its SurVeil DCB pre-market approval submission. The gross margin expansion bodes well.DownsidesRegulatory Headwinds: Surmodics’ products and business activities are subject to complex regulations worldwide. However, failing to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact the company’s business. Surmodics anticipates that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the industry it operates closely and those additional regulations may increase compliance and legal costs.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers resulting from employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has narrowed from a loss of $1.15 to $1.08 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 revenues is pegged at $24.9 million, suggesting a 4.2% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

Also, accretive acquisitions and significant progress in the company’s restructuring initiatives buoy optimism. However, unfavorable currency movement was a major dampener in the second quarter of 2022. Strong competitors in the large medical device market also pose a tough challenge for Boston Scientific. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 11.3% compared with the industry’s 31.3% fall. Boston Scientific ended the second quarter of 2022 on a bullish note, with adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Total operational sales grew 10% from the prior year. Organic sales grew 7% compared with 9% organic growth in the year-ago period (versus 2019). The reported quarter’s organic revenues also exceeded the high end of the company’s guidance range of 3% to 6%. The company’s organic growth performance was strong across all regions where most of its businesses grew at the same pace or faster than their competitors in the respective markets.In the United States, Boston Scientific delivered operational growth of 7% despite the issue of the contrast dye shortage primarily impacting the coronary therapies, WATCHMAN and PI business. In Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the business grew 12% on an operational basis on robust broad-based growth across the EMEA region, with five of eight business units posting double-digit growth. Key products in emerging markets within the region are driving growth across the portfolio with particular strength in electrophysiology, WATCHMAN and interventional cardiology therapies. In Asia-Pac, Boston Scientific grew 11% operationally with notable performance in Japan, India and the ASEAN countries.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStory continuesWe are also impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term. The company is optimistic about its acquisition of Israel-based Lumenis, which develops and commercializes energy-based medical solutions. The acquisition expands Boston Scientific’s Urology portfolio with its differentiated laser technology.Apart from this, the acquisition of Preventice Solutions (which offers new-generation detection algorithms, a broad portfolio with BodyGuardian MINI and establishes a strong position for Boston Scientific in the field of cardiac diagnostics) grew 20% on a full-year pro forma basis in 2021, driven by the company’s differentiated portfolio and strong execution. Within Electrophysiology, the early launch of Farapulse has been progressing well in Europe.In February 2022, Boston Scientific purchased Baylis Medical Company. This business is expected to expand the company’s electrophysiology and structural heart product offerings with the addition of the radiofrequency (RF) NRG and VersaCross Transseptal Platforms as well as a range of guidewires, sheaths and dilators. In the second quarter, the Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis acquisitions contributed 300 basis points to revenue growth.Boston Scientific currently expects full-year 2022 operational revenue growth to include a 250-basis-point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis and $13 million of pre0divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021.On the flip side, during the second quarter, Boston Scientific’s total revenues reflected a $130 million or 420-basis point headwind from foreign exchange, higher than the company’s expectations, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Although the company currently expects some stabilization in the cost of freight, it anticipates incremental second-half headwinds of approximately $75 million versus the pre-COVID level, resulting from inefficiencies in manufacturing plants due to the availability of direct materials and the cost to procure them.This incremental $75 million brings the total headwind versus 2019 to $375 million. This headwind is primarily due to inflationary pressure on direct materials, freight and labor costs, as well as inefficiencies in manufacturing plants due to material availability. The company now expects the full-year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below the second half 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%. Due to the increased macroeconomic pressure on gross margin, the company now anticipates the full-year adjusted operating margin to be within the range of 26% to 26.2%.Further, declining worldwide pacemaker sales over the recent past continued to weigh on Boston Scientific's CRM results. However, pacemaker sales should gradually improve with new product launches (including the launch of RESONATE platform) and easier comps.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

259,8d7ff441-9c74-305a-992d-aafd9939214b,MCK,2022-09-28,Here's Why You Should Retain Integer Holdings (ITGR) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-integer-holdings-145402671.html,1664290442,STORY,"['ITGR', 'MCK']","[Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR is well-poised for growth, courtesy of improving non-medical sales. A robust second-quarter 2022 performance, along with its solid presence in the broader MedTech space, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and a decline in Non-Medical segmental revenues continue to raise concerns.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 28.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 35.8% over the past year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 23.2% in the same time frame.With a market capitalization of $2.05 billion, ITGR manufactures and develops medical devices and components primarily for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which depend on it to design, develop and produce intellectual property-protected medical device technologies. The company’s earnings yield of 7% compares favorably with the industry’s (12.5%). It beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the average surprise being 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey CatalystsInteger Holdings delivered encouraging results with respect to its Medical segment. In the second quarter of 2022, revenues at the Medical Sales segment rose 12.7% and 5.6% year over year, on a reported and on an organic basis, respectively. Sales of the Cardio &amp; Vascular business, which is part of the Medical segment, gained almost 25% on the back of solid demand in the neurovascular, electrophysiology and structural heart markets, as well as the Oscor and Aran acquisitions.Apart from this, the company’s robust second-quarter results raise our optimism. Strong year-over-year top-line performance in the second quarter of 2022 is impressive. The robust performance of the Medical segment, along with strength in the majority of its product lines, is encouraging. Continued business recovery despite U.S. labor constraints and global supply-chain disruptions is encouraging. Integer Holdings’ buyout of Aran Biomedical in April raised optimism about the stock.Story continuesInteger Holdings’ stable footing in the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular and advanced surgical markets is encouraging. Its primary customers include large, multi-national original equipment manufacturers and their affiliated subsidiaries.Integer Holdings has been focusing on its sales efforts when it comes to increasing its market penetration in the Cardio &amp; Vascular, Neuromodulation and Non-Medical Electrochem markets. The company has been taking strategic initiatives to maintain its leadership position in the cardiac rhythm management market.Factor Hurting the StockCompetition with respect to the manufacturing of Integer Holdings’ medical products across all of its product lines has intensified in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. The market for commercial power sources is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid technological change. Several other commercial power source suppliers are larger than Integer Holdings and have greater resources, which may help them develop superior (technologically or otherwise) or more cost-effective products than the latter, thus resulting in lower revenues and operating results for Integer Holdings.In the second quarter, supplier shortages hampered sales of the Non-Medical segment. Revenues in the Non-Medical segment totaled $10.2 million, down 1.4% year over year.Estimate TrendFor 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.38 billion, indicating an improvement of 13.2% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.32, suggesting growth of 5.9% from the prior-year quarter.Integer Holdings Corporation PriceInteger Holdings Corporation PriceInteger Holdings Corporation price | Integer Holdings Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: McKesson Corp. MCK, Corteva CTVA, Atmos Energy ATO and National Fuel Gas Co. NFG.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Top-Ranked Defensive Stocks to Buy Amid Market SwingsThe investor sentiment has been pushed to the bear territory since the beginning of 2022 due to the continuous downfall of the U.S. equity market.In the year-to-date period, the Nasdaq composite, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been down 30.5%, 22.5% and 18.6%, respectively.On Friday, Sep 23, 2022, the Dow dipped 1.6%, its lowest close since November 2020. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 1.8% each. Moreover, the three indices plummeted for a second consecutive week.Factors Behind Bearish SentimentThe prevailing pessimism is attributed to the growing geopolitical tensions, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the China-Taiwan conflict, which escalated global sanctions and energy crisis in the European Union.The coronavirus pandemic-induced supply-chain constraints, a spike in the COVID-19 cases in China and the resultant strict lockdowns are other downtrends.Most importantly, rising inflationary woes and the resulting interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are major headwinds.To achieve its target of 2% inflation rate, the Fed again announced a 0.75% rate hike on Sep 21, 2022. This marks the fifth rate increase this year and the third consecutive jump of 75 basis points. The annual interest rate is marked at 8.3% for the 12 months ended August 2022, according to the U.S. Labor Department data published on Sep 13, 2022.The constant surge in interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will bear a negative impact on consumer spending. It will also cause a higher unemployment rate and thus slow down economic growth. Notably, the United States recorded two successive quarters of downslide.Story continuesSafe Investment to Stay AfloatGiven the current turmoil in the market and the growing fears of an incoming recession, investors are panicking to continue investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?To stay safe and avail returns in this unpredictable market condition, investors can pump their resources into the defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care.These sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services, which consumers will continue to access even during an unprecedented economic turmoil.Stocks catering to the defensive sectors are less likely to get affected by the economic turbulence and will thus remain a suitable choice for stable earnings.Defensive stocks also tend to offer high dividend yields, and cater to capital preservation and income generation, thereby emerging as solid picks for investors to diversify their portfolio.Our Top Stock SuggestionsWe recommend four defensive stocks as these are less sensitive to take a hit from an economic downturn.

""It has been a couple of years since this event was held due to COVID. It gives people within the community an outlet to dispose of things they have around the house that are typically difficult to get rid of safely.""The Jamestown event was held June 18, while the Columbus recycling day took place Sept. 15. It was the first such event at CEP in two years because of COVID-19. JEP didn't have its event in 2020 because of the pandemic but was able to conduct a recycling day in 2021.Both events this year happened under sunny skies, lending a festive atmosphere to the efforts.""We had people lining up at 5:30 a.m. and our event didn't start until 9 (a.m.),"" said Loren Chase, Health, Safety and Environment Leader at the Jamestown plant. ""I don't know if they got the time wrong or just enjoyed seeing the whole thing come to life.""Taken together, the events involved nearly 200 volunteers, working in concert with partners capable of safely handling hard-to-recycle items like waste paints and electronics. The Columbus event also got a helping hand from more than 40 National Honor Society volunteers from Columbus East High School in addition to volunteers from Cummins.Government leaders say community recycling days serve an important purpose as part of the three R's of waste management - reduce, reuse and recycle - to limit what ends up at landfills, incinerators and other means of waste disposal.Story continues""There is value in all unwanted items we accumulate in our homes,"" said Tracy ""T.J."" Pierce, Solid Waste Analyst for the Chautauqua County Division of Solid Waste in Jamestown. ""…The community cleanup days organized by Cummins provide our communities an awesome opportunity to remove unwanted items from people's lives and accumulate them in one place where they can be efficiently sorted and delivered to the recycling industry to extract that value.""Many of the items like waste paints, used tires, and older television sets cost money to get rid of. They were accepted at the recycling days free of charge.Given they provide people the chance to do the right thing and save money, it's no wonder the Jamestown and Columbus recycling days, each now more than a decade old, are extremely popular.""We get people calling months ahead of time asking, ‘when is the cleanup day?'"" said David Burlee, JEP's Machining Director of Operations and the longtime leader of the Jamestown event until handing that responsibility to Chase this year.

I know someone here at Yahoo! was planning to be there all week, had to cancel. But I will tell you, being in Disney World and in Universal was a reminder that this is the weirdest recession we've ever seen, if in fact, we are in a recession.Every park, every ride, everywhere you go, every restaurant is packed to the gills, beyond capacity in some cases. And not just that, it's 174 bucks per ticket at Disney World, but it's the people that are paying to skip the lines and to get the Lightning Lane as they call it. Every one of those is sold out and long lines waiting on those. This is a strange time in which either we are not in a recession, people saved up and they're just still getting that post-pandemic travel out there, or Disney World and parks like Universal are 100% completely recession-proof.

The first deployment of drone-delivered herbicide took place on two-acres of ComEd right-of-way land in Forest View, Ill. in late August. The drone deployment process took 45 minutes and 0.75 gallons of herbicide to complete what would have taken a human crew approximately two days of work and 8 gallons of herbicide solution. Recent inspection of the area has indicated that the drone herbicide deployment was successful, enabling ComEd to further refine and deploy this program in other areas to more safely and efficiently remove or maintain vegetation overgrowth that, absent proper management, could cause power outages.""Through the hard work of our 6,200 employees and continued, prudent investment in the grid, we’re delivering record-breaking reliability to the families and businesses we serve,"" said Michelle Blaise, Senior Vice President of Technical Services at ComEd. ""As a result of our team’s innovative thinking, ComEd is the first Midwest utility to utilize drones in our vegetation management program to more efficiently and more safely mitigate the threat of power outages due to plant growth or overgrowth around our power lines.""This pilot program will help ComEd address invasive and unwanted vegetation located along its transmission powerlines and quicken the process of bringing more natural prairie to approximately 65,000 acres of ComEd right-of-way (ROW) land. To cultivate natural prairie, any existing, non-native vegetation and its affiliated seed beds must be fully removed to prime the location for new, native seed growth. As of 2022, ComEd has successfully restored nearly 4,000 acres of ROW land into natural prairie and pollinator habitats. The two-acre site in Forest View is now in the process of being converted to natural prairie.Story continuesThe test site, located in an industrial area in Forest View, was the perfect location to deploy this vegetation management approach because the area was full of tall, dense vegetation including buckthorn, box elder and mulberry plants. Most of the vegetation in the area ranged from 8-10 feet in height. Should the vegetation have grown onto the nearby power lines, it could have caused outages or service disruptions in the area.The drones, operated by the Davey Resource Group, are specially designed to deploy ComEd’s Environmental Protection Agency approved herbicide mixture over the area, identified via GPS coordinates. The devices are equipped with a 2.5-gallon tank for the herbicide solution and utilize propellers to deploy the fine mist over the targeted field, providing more consistent, controlled coverage than spraying from ground level.This is one of the many innovative approaches ComEd’s Vegetation Management team have implemented to avoid outages and service disruptions due to overgrown vegetation near powerlines. Since the summer of 2019, ComEd has utilized a team of goats to help clear vegetation in difficult to access places. Among its benefits, the program drives maximum efficiency of this work, cutting the cost and time by more than half, while also reducing safety risks for workers and air emissions from fuel-burning equipment.Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), the nation’s leading competitive energy provider, with approximately 10 million customers. ComEd provides service to approximately 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

Climate risk and resilience are largely modeled by insurance companies, looking at how a company's assets may be affected by rising sea levels, extreme heat, increasing natural disasters and other future climate events as climate change worsens.Free acknowledged that while these efforts are important and worthwhile, there needs to be more focus on decarbonization.""Acknowledging climate risk is a critical first step, but what really matters is how investors are going to use their money to drive the transition to a more sustainable planet,"" said Free.Fortunately, in the past year, investors have started focusing more on decarbonization and offsets, according to Free. With Nasdaq recently acquiring a majority stake in Puro.earth, the world's first marketplace to offer industrial carbon removal instruments, the cumulative committed trade value of CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) grew five times in one year.This increase is a major development for the evolving ESG market. While ESG funds are at all-time highs, increasing by 50% this year to $2.7 trillion, even more investment is needed. It is estimated that $15 trillion a year must be put toward green technologies to meet net-zero emissions.Story continuesLise Pretorius, Head of Sustainability Analysis at Matter, agreed with Free. She cited the massive growth of ESG initiatives as a great achievement but was wary of the lack of democratized data that can clearly define certain ESG investments as sustainable.She argued that because there is no standardized definition for sustainable investment, it is harder to determine which ESG initiatives are causing a net change for the good.""[Right now] ESG is basically a box of chocolates; you don't know what you are going to get,"" said Pretorius.As climate data becomes more democratized, it will provide a better understanding of which ESG initiatives aid progress toward a net-zero world. Stannard cited the rise in companies releasing their emissions data as a step in the right direction, largely brought about by new regulations and shareholder pressure. According to Stannard, there has been a 15% increase in publicly disclosed emissions data and a 40% increase in companies showing higher quality emissions data.Pretorius echoed Stannard and pushed further, citing new efforts to collect data from multiple stakeholders. These include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks and others that combine diverse insights to produce a clearer picture of a company's role in climate impact.Amalgamation and democratization of data is the key to holding companies and financial service firms accountable for their ambitious climate investing goals, the panel agreed.""The 2025-2030 period will be really exciting because the decarbonization of these portfolios will have to accelerate to maintain their alignment to a net-zero scenario,"" said Stannard.Pretorius and Free agreed and claimed investors will expect even more from companies than mere divestment from non-renewable assets.""They need to showcase they are having a positive impact on the climate as well,"" said Free.Beyond divestment, ""emissions can be reduced by funding greener companies on public and private markets, but also on fixed income markets, sustainable bonds, green bonds, etc."" said Free.In fact, sustainable bonds are a great way for investors to expose themselves to positive climate impact while helping companies raise capital for green initiatives, according to Free.Nasdaq is home to the first and largest Sustainable Bond Market, which allows enterprises to raise debt capital with various eco-friendly deliverables. Companies that fail to fulfill their bond agreement are held accountable by having to pay back investors with additional interest.Since its inception, the bond market has seen a wide range of participation, including the city of Helsingborg, Sweden, which listed a sustainability-linked bond as part of its efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2035.To match the increasing interest in ESG investments Nasdaq released our Sustainable Bond Network, a platform that connects issuers of sustainable bonds with investors, empowering them to evaluate impact and make informed investment decisions on sustainable bonds.While there is still a long way to go to meet the Paris agreement, Free ended the panel with a simple blueprint to reach it.""Clients need to vote with their money. Give money to those doing good, take money from those doing bad-that will ultimately drive the transition to a more sustainable global economy,"" Free said.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/717663/The-Future-of-Climate-Investing]"

(NYSE:URI) today outlined the steps the company is taking to reduce the environmental impact of its operations and help its customers reduce their carbon footprint. The initiatives United Rentals is undertaking to achieve these goals are detailed in the new white paper ""Sustainability at United Rentals."" The white paper details three focus areas:First, the company is looking at its own operations, focusing on how it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from non-rental fleets, buildings and operations. Reducing emissions in the United Rentals non-rental fleet is one of the top priorities. In an agreement with Ford Motor Company, United Rentals announced it is adding electric vehicles to its fleet for use by the company's sales, service and delivery personnel. Additionally, United Rentals is adopting more efficient technologies in its buildings and properties to further reduce GHG emissions. The company has created an employee resource group called Planet United to lead and engage other employees in environmental awareness.Second, United Rentals is helping its customers create lower-emission worksites without compromising safety or productivity. The company continues to expand low- and zero-emissions rental equipment options in its fleet. United Rentals initiatives with Ford, POWRBANK and Takeuchi, JCB and others demonstrate company commitment to provide eco-friendly equipment to the rental mix. United Rentals is working with several manufacturers to add even more environmentally friendly rental equipment to its portfolio, including more electric, dual fuel or hybrid forklifts, aerial lifts and skid steers, as well as solar-powered LED light towers.Third, as customers build plans to achieve sustainability goals, United Rentals can help them reduce their equipment footprint by assisting with strategies, visibility and tracking.

291,8c4141c1-becc-3bc7-b232-af05d3ddeee2,URI,2022-09-28,5 Value Stocks to Buy for Safety Amid Fed-Led Market Ruckus,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-value-stocks-buy-safety-121012663.html,1664280612,STORY,"['MPC', 'URI', 'CAR', 'UNM', 'DDS']","[September is historically known as the toughest month on Wall Street. This year, the performances of U.S. stock markets are more disappointing courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.However, the Fed has failed to cool 40-year high inflation. This is because aggregate demand has remained strong owing to astonishing savings that Americans generated in the last two pandemic-ridden years with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock’s valuation.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Dillard's Inc. DDS, United Rentals Inc. URI and Unum Group UNM.A Global Financial Crisis Looms Large The Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively.Investors were expecting a rate cut in 2023, which is out of the question now as the central bank has projected that the median benchmark interest rate will reach 4.6% in 2023. This means another 50 basis-point rate hike throughout 2023. The first rate cut is not expected before 2024 as the Fed is expecting inflation to come down to its target rate of 2% in 2025.As the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.Story continuesWith respect to the U.S. dollar – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low and the euro is at a 20-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Threat of a RecessionEconomists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 26, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 3.9%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.703%.The yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAvis Budget Group provides car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services to businesses and consumers. The ability of CAR to cater to a wide range of mobility demands helps it to expand and strengthen its global foothold through organic growth.Avis Budget Group operates through distinct global brands that focus on different market segments and complement other brands in their respective regional markets. Fleet expansion and technology enhancement efforts by CAR are likely to enhance its offerings. The forward P/E of Avis Budget Group for the current financial year is 3.4X, lower than the industry average of 14.8X. CAR has a PEG ratio of 0.2, lower than the industry average of 1.3. Avis Budget Group has expected earnings growth of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. Marathon Petroleum is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.The forward P/E of Marathon Petroleum for the current financial year is 4.7X, lower than the industry average of 6.2X. MPC has a PEG ratio of 0.3, lower than the industry average of 0.5. Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

URI has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals.Better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in non-residential construction and industrial verticals, higher total and rental revenues and stronger pricing aided United Rentals’ second-quarter 2022 results. During the period, rental revenues grew 26.2% from a year ago. Adjusted gross margin expanded 360 basis points.The forward P/E of United Rentals for the current financial year is 9.2X, lower than the industry average of 12X. URI has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 1.0. United Rentals has an expected earnings growth rate of 43.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 6.8% over the last 60 days.Unum Group’s conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. The sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business lines and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience.Continued rollout of dental products and geographic expansion have been paying off for UNM as its acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders’ value. Unum Group expects 2022 premiums to grow about 2%. Adjusted operating EPS is expected to grow 15-20%.The forward P/E of Unum Group for the current financial year is 6.3X, lower than the industry average of 14.5X. UNM has a PEG ratio of 0.8 lower than the industry average of 1.4. Unum Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.2% over the last 7 days.Dillard's operates retail department stores in the southeast, southwest and Midwest areas of the United States.

These aggressive measures to lower excess inventory owing to the pandemic-led decline in demand have proven beneficial to the company’s margins.The forward P/E of Dillard's for the current financial year is 7.4X, lower than the industry average of 7.7X. DDS has a PEG ratio of 0.5, lower than the industry average of 0.7.

292,f3e82994-243d-3bd1-9fc3-389dc7e4b552,ORCL,2022-09-28,Oracle Corporation's (NYSE:ORCL) Earnings Haven't Escaped The Attention Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporations-nyse-orcl-earnings-120148880.html,1664366508,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Oracle Corporation's (NYSE:ORCL) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 29x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 7x are quite common. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Oracle could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle peKeen to find out how analysts think Oracle's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Oracle's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Oracle's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 55% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 31% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 37% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Oracle is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Oracle's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   4 warning signs for Oracle  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Oracle, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

293,3ae065ca-b5f8-37ed-9a1e-3fb44132f98b,ORCL,2022-09-28,"Musk Hasn’t Handed Over His Texts With Morgan Stanley’s CEO, Twitter Says",Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-hasn-t-handed-over-164123718.html,1664318149,STORY,"['ORCL', 'MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP', 'TSLA']","[(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. is complaining Elon Musk’s legal team hasn’t turned over his texts with Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman ahead of trial over the $44 billion acquisition offer Musk is trying to cancel.Lawyers for Twitter asked Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick at a hearing Tuesday to sanction the billionaire and his lawyers for not producing texts with Gorman and Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison. The judge said she was “troubled” by how Musk’s team handled the messages, but said she’ll rule later.Twitter subpoenaed the texts before the Oct. 17 trial in Wilmington, Delaware, in which McCormick will decide whether the world’s richest person had legitimate grounds for walking away from his $54.20-per-share offer to buy the social media platform. Morgan Stanley was Musk’s chief financial adviser and pledged more than $5 billion in financing, while Ellison invested $1 billion.According to Twitter’s court filings, Musk withheld four texts with Gorman, including some from April 25, the day the company accepted Musk’s offer. “The time has come for the court to issue a severe sanction” over the handling of texts and emails by Musk and his top aides, said Bradley Wilson, one of Twitter’s lawyers.During the hearing Tuesday, the Twitter team also complained Musk’s lawyers with dragging their feet in disclosing research that may show the extent of spam and robot accounts on the platform wasn’t nearly as significant as the billionaire claimed publicly.‘Early Morning’ TextsEarlier this month, Twitter’s legal team pointed to a May text by Musk to another Morgan Stanley banker seeking to slow down the deal process until after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech the following day about the war Ukraine. “It won’t make sense to buy Twitter if we’re heading into World War III,” Musk wrote.Twitter is also targeting texts between Musk and Ellison just before the former announced he was withdrawing his offer. The two billionaires were communicating “into the early morning hours,” Twitter said.Story continues“Musk sent his final message to Ellison at 12:20 a.m. on May 13,” according to the filing. About four hours later, Musk tweeted he was putting the deal on hold over concerns Twitter was under-counting the number of bot accounts on the platform.Twitter further complained Musk failed to turn over some of his own texts as well as some from top aide Jared Birchall and lead lawyer Alex Spiro. The company said it was able to obtain some of the texts from the other parties copied in the messages. Twitter called this another example of Musk’s “lackadaisical efforts” to hand over relevant information.A spokesman for Musk’s lawyers didn’t have any immediate comment Tuesday. Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, and an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment.McCormick denied a previous Twitter request for sanctions but sharply criticized Musk for failing to turn over texts. She noted Musk produced June 17 texts that Robert Steel of Perella Weinberg sent him 18 minutes apart. Steel first asked a question and then subsequently texted, “Ok. Got it...,” leaving a clear gap in the exchange, the judge said.“Assuming that Musk’s response was not telepathic, one would expect some evidence of it in defendants’ document production,” McCormick wrote. “But defendants provided none by the deadline.”Twitter seeks to convince McCormick that Musk pulled out of the deal because of buyer’s remorse, not over concerns about the number of bots embedded in the platform’s more than 230 million users.On Tuesday, the company’s lawyers complained their counterparts were dragging their feet in turning over unredacted reports by data scientists hired by Musk to assess the bot issue.Some of the materials already produced show Musk’s experts found only about 11% of the customer base was made up of bots, Wilson said. Twitter estimated in securities filings bots make up about 5%.Musk claims his analysis shows as much as a third of Twitter’s customers may be robots rather than humans and the platform’s executives misled him and company investors about the issue to protect advertising revenue.“We think it’s clear why” the Tesla CEO wants to avoid turning over the full bot reports because they are at odds with his estimates, Wilson said. McCormick said she’d rule later on the issue.The case is Twitter v. Musk, 22-0613, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).(Updates with judge’s comment in hearing starting in second paragraph)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

299,dac9e3fd-a7df-3da0-87ac-d0f1cc503949,ORCL,2022-09-28,Is Trending Stock Oracle Corporation (ORCL) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-oracle-corporation-orcl-130001930.html,1664283601,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Oracle (ORCL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this software maker have returned -14.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has lost 12.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.98 points to a change of +1.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6.7%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.52 indicates a change of +11% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Oracle, the consensus sales estimate of $12.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.4%. The $49.68 billion and $52.83 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.1% and +6.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although they are the backbone of technology, chips go through major cycles alongside the economy and demand for electronics. With inflation continuing to rise, it is no surprise that many semiconductor companies such as Micron Technology MU, Intel INTC and Advanced Micro Devices AMD have all seen their stocks be crushed by weakening consumer demand. Consumers are reluctant to spend on technology products during high inflationary periods.Micron is one of the largest makers of memory chips in the world, with its offerings in PCs, smartphones, and other devises. Micron is also expanding into other areas like data centers, electric and connected vehicles, 5G, artificial intelligence, and more. Trading 50% off its highs, it will be important to see Micron’s demand outlook for semiconductor memory solutions.Micron stated last quarter that industry demand had weakened, but CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said he was taking actions to moderate supply growth in fiscal 2023. Mehrotra went on to say that long-term secular demand for memory and storage are well positioned to deliver strong cross-cycle financial performance.Performance Micron stock is down -46% year to date. Despite the large decline over the last year, Micron shares are up a respectable +33% in the past five years with the benchmark at +51%. Micron has also outperformed the Semi-Memory Market over this time span with its Zacks Subindustry at +28%.Micron has also posted positive earnings surprises for 10 consecutive quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MU’s fiscal Q4 earnings is $1.45 per share, which would represent a considerable -40% decrease from Q4 2021. Sales for Q4 are also expected to decline 16% at $6.92 billion. Estimates for the period have continued trending down over the past two months, with full year earnings estimates for this year and FY23 trending down as well.Story continuesYear over year, MU is projected to post 37% earnings growth in 2022, but FY23 earnings are expected to decline -46%. Top line growth is expected to be up 12% in FY22 but decline -15% in FY23 to $26.18 billion.Despite the trend of beatings earnings expectations, Micron shares have stayed submerged in volatility with the company’s mention of weakening demand being noted by investors during MU’s fiscal third quarter. The current quarter will be no different and the company’s guidance will be more closely monitored than usual under uncertain economic conditions.Valuation Currently trading around $50 a share, MU has a forward P/E of 10.8X. This is much lower than its high over the last five years of 29.8X and near the median of 8.1X.Despite Micron’s forward P/E indicating the company trades at a discount relative to its past, the uncertain economic environment, particularly for technology stocks has seen MU’s estimate revisions continue to decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom LineRising inflation has severely impacted the demand for chips in regard to the business outlook for new products and expansion for semiconductor memory technology. MU currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in correlation to current chip demand and downward earnings estimate revisions.Perhaps an earnings beat, and more importantly, better than expected FY23 guidance could help get MU stock back on track.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Brooke DiPalma here with the details. Tell me it's those cinnamon crispas. Tell me it's those cinnamon chips.BROOKE DIPALMA: I am so sorry, but it is--DAVE BRIGGS: Ugh.BROOKE DIPALMA: --neither of those. Reward members actually can only choose between the double decker taco or the enchurrito. So this starts today. Reward members can go on the app and choose. Now a double decker taco was introduced in 1995 as a limited time offering, reintroduced in 2006. The enchurrito had a longer run, a 40-year run. It hit the menu in 1970, left the menu in 2013.This comes after the mega success of the limited time offering, the Mexican pizza earlier this year. Yum Brands CEO noting that demand for the Mexican pizza was seven times previous levels, reaching over 20 million pizzas sold nationwide, with some stores selling out within a week, creating a sustained positive halo for the brand. So perhaps Taco Bell allowing members to choose which one will become a permanent menu item. This ends October 7. And then menus at participating locations will have the chosen winner later on this year.SEANA SMITH: Well, I was really, really hoping for the pizza, but both of those options sound good to me. All right, Brooke, Taco Bell is not the only one that's trying to cash in on this nostalgia craze. We got news out from McDonald's. They're trying to sell happy meals to adults. What can you tell us?BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right. So these are Happy Meal inspired, but they are adult meals here, of course, Happy Meal coming out of 1979.

So this is a new boxed meal, they're calling it, designed specifically for adult fans. So starting October 3, the box will be available in restaurants, drive thrus, buy delivery, or on the McDonald's app while supplies last.Story continuesNow, customers can choose between a Big Mac or a 10-piece chicken nugget to go into this box, and of course what they coined, alongside their world famous fries. But here's the catch here. This is in collaboration with that Cactus Plant Flea. So it will also come with one of four collectible figurines. The true nostalgic part here, it'll include either Grimace the Hamburglar, Birdie, or a newcomer, the Cactus Buddy, of course, playing on Cactus Plant Flea Market's name.Now, along with this launch, there will also be merchandise available. Of course, we've seen McDonald's try this earlier this year with their Sichuan sauce. They also recently unveiled the cheese danish. So really looking to tap into Gen Z and capture that nostalgia as well. But I have to ask, are any of you planning to stand by October 3 and get this drop?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, buddy.SEANA SMITH: Why not?DAVE BRIGGS: The Hamburglar is awesome.SEANA SMITH: I like it.DAVE BRIGGS: I love the Hamburglar.BROOKE DIPALMA: It's important to remember that this flea market also teamed up with Ye, Kanye West, of course. They also collaborated with Supreme, Nike. So these do sell out fast. So if you are planning on it, be sure to log in October 3 for sure.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thank you, Brooke DiPalma there.

Brooke DiPalma here with the details. Tell me it's those cinnamon crispas. Tell me it's those cinnamon chips.BROOKE DIPALMA: I am so sorry, but it is--DAVE BRIGGS: Ugh.BROOKE DIPALMA: --neither of those. Reward members actually can only choose between the double decker taco or the enchurrito. So this starts today. Reward members can go on the app and choose. Now a double decker taco was introduced in 1995 as a limited time offering, reintroduced in 2006. The enchurrito had a longer run, a 40-year run. It hit the menu in 1970, left the menu in 2013.This comes after the mega success of the limited time offering, the Mexican pizza earlier this year. Yum Brands CEO noting that demand for the Mexican pizza was seven times previous levels, reaching over 20 million pizzas sold nationwide, with some stores selling out within a week, creating a sustained positive halo for the brand. So perhaps Taco Bell allowing members to choose which one will become a permanent menu item. This ends October 7. And then menus at participating locations will have the chosen winner later on this year.SEANA SMITH: Well, I was really, really hoping for the pizza, but both of those options sound good to me. All right, Brooke, Taco Bell is not the only one that's trying to cash in on this nostalgia craze. We got news out from McDonald's. They're trying to sell happy meals to adults. What can you tell us?BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right. So these are Happy Meal inspired, but they are adult meals here, of course, Happy Meal coming out of 1979. So McDonald's really trying to hit nostalgia as well here. This is a collaboration with the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market. So this is a new boxed meal, they're calling it, designed specifically for adult fans. So starting October 3, the box will be available in restaurants, drive thrus, buy delivery, or on the McDonald's app while supplies last.Story continuesNow, customers can choose between a Big Mac or a 10-piece chicken nugget to go into this box, and of course what they coined, alongside their world famous fries. But here's the catch here. This is in collaboration with that Cactus Plant Flea. So it will also come with one of four collectible figurines. The true nostalgic part here, it'll include either Grimace the Hamburglar, Birdie, or a newcomer, the Cactus Buddy, of course, playing on Cactus Plant Flea Market's name.Now, along with this launch, there will also be merchandise available. Of course, we've seen McDonald's try this earlier this year with their Sichuan sauce. They also recently unveiled the cheese danish. So really looking to tap into Gen Z and capture that nostalgia as well. But I have to ask, are any of you planning to stand by October 3 and get this drop?DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, buddy.SEANA SMITH: Why not?DAVE BRIGGS: The Hamburglar is awesome.SEANA SMITH: I like it.DAVE BRIGGS: I love the Hamburglar.BROOKE DIPALMA: It's important to remember that this flea market also teamed up with Ye, Kanye West, of course. They also collaborated with Supreme, Nike. So these do sell out fast. So if you are planning on it, be sure to log in October 3 for sure.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thank you, Brooke DiPalma there. Thanks so much.]"

We're going to start things off with FedEx. Morgan Stanley slashing its price target on the company from $250 to $125, saying the shipping company has been reset following its profit warning. And shares are still holding onto gains. Of course, the broader markets higher here in the US today. And FedEx still holding on to some slight gains.But I think more broadly, FedEx had really been one of these first companies even prior to the next earnings season set to kick off, really giving that warning more macroeconomically, but globally as well. And that really kind of gives some type of glean into how business to business partnerships are faring, but also on the end consumer and the volumes that they're seeing start to decline as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, this definitely feels like an after the fact price cut, right, in this particular case because the stock's already had its tumble of 29% since it came out and changed its forecast. So it's basically like an acknowledgment of reality, right?BRAD SMITH: Right, yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, I think the bottom line with FedEx is that they need to show, I think, investors a couple of good quarters. And by that, I mean, some form of stabilization in the top line. And then when it comes to expenses, that all these expenses, I think they promise they're going to cut close to $3 billion in cost last week. They need to start-- that needs to start showing up on the bottom line at some point.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely here.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we're also watching shares of McDonald's after Citi said they see increasingly less favorable risk-reward with the stock and lowered their price target from $275 to $246. I have a full story on this note now on the Yahoo Finance home page. But I will say this. Looks like a lot of focus by John Tower. He's been on with us a lot, the analyst that covers restaurants and McDonald's over at Citi, talking about risk to Europe. So a real slowdown in Europe potentially hurting McDonald's business. Even though that US might stay pretty well in terms of sales, Tower more concerned about the trends overseas, and the US may be not able to offset that.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: It's a difference in taste profiles, too. I mean, McDonald's menu looks vastly different in different parts of the world. And so in acknowledging where they're even able, at this point, to navigate where they would need certain products, inventory to actually get through to their franchisees, that could be a far more materially detrimental process that they're wading through, but also even the pricing mechanisms for themselves to get those products, and for the franchisees to have to figure out, all right, how do we just continue to pass that cost on to the consumer who's looking for some type of discount on the fast food items?JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, we keep talking about the stronger dollar throughout the show. This is an example of the stronger dollar is going to bite McDonald's. It's a double whammy.BRIAN SOZZI: I like that.JULIE HYMAN: Slowing-- no, I didn't even mean to do that.BRIAN SOZZI: You did it.JULIE HYMAN: It's a double whammy, right? On the one hand, you've got slowing economies around the globe. Are people going to be eating out less, even at a value proposition like McDonald's? And secondly, when they do bring those profits back home, they're worht less.BRIAN SOZZI: Less super sized profits for McDonald's.JULIE HYMAN: There you go. All right, I'm looking at shares of Lucid. They are higher today. We're seeing a boost for a lot of the EV makers. Lucid in particular rising after Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of the electric vehicle maker with an overweight rating, a $23 price target, which is well above where it is now.And the analysts there saying the brand has greater efficiency, longer range, faster charging than its competition. They're also looking at potential for the company to capture about 2% of the global EV market by 2026. Now, to me, that's pretty remarkable, given that Lucid is a luxury product. We're not talking about like a 1 to 1 with Tesla competition. We're talking about that this is a much higher end vehicle.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I'm generally fascinated on how a Lucid, even a Polestar, fare during any form of recession. It would be their first recessions that they go through. What does bear-- what do bear markets mean for a super luxury purchase like Lucid? I suspect we're about to find out.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I think it's amazing what Peter Rawlinson has been able to build over at Lucid, really taking so much of what he was able to engineer over at Tesla over to a new and launching a new brand in Lucid, and ultimately at the higher end. Because knowing exactly where people had gravitated towards these products early on, Tesla had differentiated itself by saying, you know what? No, we're going to not go mass market out the gate. We're going to go luxury. That's exactly what Lucid did. And we're seeing continuously how some of the investors and the analysts are cozying up to that strategy from Peter Rawlinson and the team.JULIE HYMAN: Indeed.]"

320,f25a8036-d9a6-3bd3-a9bb-07b1f6870560,AXP,2022-09-28,Institutional investors may adopt severe steps after American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) latest 10% drop adds to a year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-may-adopt-severe-120126640.html,1664366486,STORY,['AXP'],"[A look at the shareholders of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 10% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 20% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell American Express, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that American Express does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in American Express. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 5.9% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$118m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 20% of American Express. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for American Express  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

321,2dca7f4e-73c9-367a-987a-f5c75eb58c3a,AXP,2022-09-28,Here's How 4 Dow Finance Stocks are Holding Up in Bear Market,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-4-dow-finance-stocks-134801986.html,1664286481,STORY,"['GS', 'AXP', 'V', 'JPM', '^DJI', 'GSBD']","[The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index has slipped into the bear market. Following yesterday’s decline of 1.1%, the index is now down 20.5% from its Jan 4 peak (hence meeting the definition of a bear market).Worries that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance to fight decade-high inflation will push the U.S. economy into a downturn have weighed on investor sentiments since the beginning of 2022. This has sent the domestic equity markets tumbling after a solid performance last year.The Dow, the 30-stock blue-chip index, rallied almost 19% in 2021. But macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have led to a pessimistic stance since the start of this year. Today we are looking into the performance of four financial services stocks – JPMorgan JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Visa V and American Express AXP – that are part of the index.So far this year, shares of JPM, GS, V and AXP have plunged 32.6%, 23%, 16.7% and 16%, respectively. The beaten-down stock prices might turn out to be an attractive entry point for investors in quality franchises.Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the central bank’s efforts to curb inflation by raising interest rates will benefit the finance sector stocks, the expectations of economic slowdown/recession in the coming six-nine months remain a big headwind. Until now, consumer confidence and spending are holding up well, but with the steady rate increase, these are likely to witness weakness.Hence, investors are shying away from stock markets. Nonetheless, this is the best time to invest in quality stocks that are fundamentally strong and will bounce back resoundingly once these concerns go away.Let’s now discuss the above-mentioned four Dow finance stocks in detail.JPMorgan is the largest bank (in terms of consolidated assets and market cap) in the United States. The company is a bellwether in the banking space, given the sheer size (serves more than 66 million U.S. households) and quality of its asset base and industry-leading franchises in investment, commercial and consumer banking businesses.JPM’s balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. The company has been extensively investing in technology to stay ahead of the competitors, which include not only other banks but also technology firms. The company has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, which will strengthen its operations through technological advancement.After consolidating its branch network for several years, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced an initiative in 2018 to expand in new regions by opening branches. This bodes well in garnering market share and offers solid cross-selling opportunities in the card and auto loan sectors. It is also expanding operations overseas, in China and Europe.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite a challenging operating environment, JPM’s deposits and loan balances have remained strong. Though loan demand has been subdued since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, there has been a marked improvement in the same of late. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2022, total loans grew 6% year over year to $1.1 trillion.While higher rates and the expected global economic slowdown will continue hampering investment banking (IB) business, JPMorgan’s leading position in garnering global IB fees will offer leverage. Also, ongoing macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions should keep the markets volatile in the quarters ahead, helping the company earn measurable trading revenues (which account for almost 25% of its total net revenues).Also, JPM currently pays investors $4.00 per share as an annual dividend, which yields 3.66%. The company increased its dividend four times in the past five years, and its payout grew 14.82% over the same time period. JPM's payout ratio is 32% of earnings at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has moved slightly north over the past week.Goldman, one of the major players in IB business, is undertaking measures to diversify operations. The company is making efforts inorganically to boost asset management and wealth management businesses, while expanding its digital consumer banking platform – Marcus by Goldman Sachs.In April 2022, this Zacks Rank #3 company acquired Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, while in March, it closed the acquisition of GreenSky. In 2020 and 2019, it completed the purchase of Folio Financial and United Capital, respectively. Further, its asset management division has announced a deal to acquire robo-advisor NextCapital.The company’s IB revenues, which witnessed a four-year CAGR of 22.1% (ended 2021), fell in the first half of 2022 due to a decline in industry-wide completed M&amp;A transactions. Yet, Goldman’s solid position in worldwide announced and completed M&amp;As will likely give it an edge over its peers. Robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are other tailwinds.Backed by a solid capital position, Goldman has consistently enhanced shareholders’ value. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share in July. Prior to this, it announced a dividend hike by 60% to $2 per share last year.Based on the dividend paid out over the trailing four quarters, GS has a dividend yield of 3.31%. In the last five years, the company has increased its dividend five times, with an annualized growth rate of 25.7%. Further, the company’s payout ratio is 18% of earnings.Also, GS looks undervalued with respect to price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The stock has a P/E (F1) ratio of 8.66, which is lower than the industry average of 12.45. Also, its P/B ratio of 0.96 is below the industry average of 1.54.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 has remained unchanged.Visa operates as a payments technology company globally. In recent years, the company has evolved its business to accelerate the migration of digital payments across new channels. It has also adopted new digital payment and security technologies, such as contactless and tokenization.Visa Token Service, Visa Checkout and Visa In-App Provisioning are some of the digital solutions that have been developed by the company to advance its digital platform. V is also pushing technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay, tap-to-pay, and secure remote commerce, which should be the main modes of payment in the near future. Thus, Visa has significant prospects for growth in the emerging payments industry in the years to come. It is well poised for growth owing to BNPL, crypto and other fintechs.For Visa, M&amp;As, partnerships and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve robust growth. These moves have helped the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space.

In addition, PPL published its latest response to the CDP Climate Survey, which provides detailed disclosures centered around the company's clean energy transition and climate-related risks and opportunties.""As an innovative, best-in-class utility operator, PPL is poised to lead the clean energy transition while keeping energy service affordable and reliable for our customers,"" said Christine Martin, PPL's vice president of public affairs and chief sustainability officer.

In addition, the company is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040. These goals cover Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gases and also include Scope 3 emissions associated with purchased electricity for customers of Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, two PPL subsidiaries.Through 2021, PPL reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels, putting the company on track to achieve its interim targets and 2050 net-zero goal.""The primary focus of our decarbonization strategy is reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Martin. ""To that end, we expect to retire 2,000 MW of coal-fired generation by 2034 and expect at least 1,000 MW to retire by 2028. We are currently planning for the 2028 generation replacement and will be filing our plan with the Kentucky Public Service Commission near year-end 2022.

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. So after we looked into PPL (NYSE:PPL), the trends above didn't look too great.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PPL:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$37b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, PPL has an ROCE of 4.4%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 4.4%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for PPL roceIn the above chart we have measured PPL's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PPL here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?There is reason to be cautious about PPL, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 8.4% that they were earning five years ago. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect PPL to turn into a multi-bagger.What We Can Learn From PPL's ROCEIn summary, it's unfortunate that PPL is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. And long term shareholders have watched their investments stay flat over the last five years. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing PPL that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) stock at an average price of US$63.66 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. The company's market worth decreased by US$2.8b over the past week after the stock price dropped 3.4%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Fredric Reynolds, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$58.35. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Mondelez International shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Mondelez International better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.1% of Mondelez International shares, worth about US$96m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The Mondelez International Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Mondelez International shares in the last quarter. Still, the insider transactions at Mondelez International in the last 12 months are not very heartening. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort.

Also, accretive acquisitions and significant progress in the company’s restructuring initiatives buoy optimism. However, unfavorable currency movement was a major dampener in the second quarter of 2022. Strong competitors in the large medical device market also pose a tough challenge for Boston Scientific. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 11.3% compared with the industry’s 31.3% fall. Boston Scientific ended the second quarter of 2022 on a bullish note, with adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Total operational sales grew 10% from the prior year. Organic sales grew 7% compared with 9% organic growth in the year-ago period (versus 2019). The reported quarter’s organic revenues also exceeded the high end of the company’s guidance range of 3% to 6%. The company’s organic growth performance was strong across all regions where most of its businesses grew at the same pace or faster than their competitors in the respective markets.In the United States, Boston Scientific delivered operational growth of 7% despite the issue of the contrast dye shortage primarily impacting the coronary therapies, WATCHMAN and PI business. In Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the business grew 12% on an operational basis on robust broad-based growth across the EMEA region, with five of eight business units posting double-digit growth. Key products in emerging markets within the region are driving growth across the portfolio with particular strength in electrophysiology, WATCHMAN and interventional cardiology therapies. In Asia-Pac, Boston Scientific grew 11% operationally with notable performance in Japan, India and the ASEAN countries.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStory continuesWe are also impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term. The company is optimistic about its acquisition of Israel-based Lumenis, which develops and commercializes energy-based medical solutions. The acquisition expands Boston Scientific’s Urology portfolio with its differentiated laser technology.Apart from this, the acquisition of Preventice Solutions (which offers new-generation detection algorithms, a broad portfolio with BodyGuardian MINI and establishes a strong position for Boston Scientific in the field of cardiac diagnostics) grew 20% on a full-year pro forma basis in 2021, driven by the company’s differentiated portfolio and strong execution. Within Electrophysiology, the early launch of Farapulse has been progressing well in Europe.In February 2022, Boston Scientific purchased Baylis Medical Company. This business is expected to expand the company’s electrophysiology and structural heart product offerings with the addition of the radiofrequency (RF) NRG and VersaCross Transseptal Platforms as well as a range of guidewires, sheaths and dilators. In the second quarter, the Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis acquisitions contributed 300 basis points to revenue growth.Boston Scientific currently expects full-year 2022 operational revenue growth to include a 250-basis-point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis and $13 million of pre0divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021.On the flip side, during the second quarter, Boston Scientific’s total revenues reflected a $130 million or 420-basis point headwind from foreign exchange, higher than the company’s expectations, due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Although the company currently expects some stabilization in the cost of freight, it anticipates incremental second-half headwinds of approximately $75 million versus the pre-COVID level, resulting from inefficiencies in manufacturing plants due to the availability of direct materials and the cost to procure them.This incremental $75 million brings the total headwind versus 2019 to $375 million. This headwind is primarily due to inflationary pressure on direct materials, freight and labor costs, as well as inefficiencies in manufacturing plants due to material availability. The company now expects the full-year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below the second half 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%. Due to the increased macroeconomic pressure on gross margin, the company now anticipates the full-year adjusted operating margin to be within the range of 26% to 26.2%.Further, declining worldwide pacemaker sales over the recent past continued to weigh on Boston Scientific's CRM results. However, pacemaker sales should gradually improve with new product launches (including the launch of RESONATE platform) and easier comps.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, McKesson MCK and Semler Scientific SMLR.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price.

Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BSX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, Albemarle Corp. ALB, HF Sinclair Corp. DINO, Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA and Carlisle Companies Inc. CSL.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Stocks with Solid Profitability Amid Recession FearsWall Street has witnessed its worst first half in 50 years this year. Thereafter, a two month-long impressive summer rally raised hope among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed's tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Inflation, Rate Hike and Recession ConcernsThe Fed, so far, has been unable to cool down inflation from a 40-year high despite adopting ultra-hawkish monetary stances. The central bank has hiked the interest rate by 3% year to date, unseen since 1990.Moreover, the Fed has raised the median of the Fed Fund rate to 4.4% in September from 3.4% in June. This means that the range of the benchmark lending rate at the end of 2022 will be 4.25-4.5%, indicating a 75 basis-point and 50 basis-point interest rate hike in November and December, respectively. Market participants are now adjusting the cost of an imminent recession in the U.S. economy into stock markets' valuationAs of Sep 23, our projection has shown that the overall earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to grow 1.1% year over year. This indicates a stiff fall from 8.1% earnings growth year over year estimated in Jun 15. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have tumbled 10.3%, 10.8% and 12.2%, respectively, in the past month.Our Top PicksDespite this grim scenario, a handful of stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days. This means that investors are expecting these companies to do solid business for the rest of 2022, defying macro-economic headwinds. Investment in such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful going forward.Story continuesWe have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong growth potential for the rest of 2022. Each of our picks currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum Corp. is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC's $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC's exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last 7 days.Albemarle Corp. should gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market. It is expected to benefit from its actions to boost its global lithium derivative capacity. ALB will also benefit from the synergies of the Rockwood acquisition. The buyout has enhanced diversity across end markets.Albemarle also remains focused on executing its cost-reduction program. Its cost-saving actions are expected to support margins in 2022. ALB also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging strong cash flows. It remains focused on maintaining its dividend payout. Albemarle has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations.Albemarle has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 30 days.HF Sinclair Corp. operates as an independent energy company. DINO produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, specialty lubricant products, specialty chemicals, specialty and modified asphalt, and others.HF Sinclair also owns and operates refineries located in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and markets its refined products principally in the Southwest United States and Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, and in other neighboring Plains states.HF Sinclair has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last 7 days.Ulta Beauty Inc. has been benefiting from its omnichannel strength. Also, the skincare category has been gaining from consumers' rising interest in self-care. ULTA's solid performance was backed by the strong execution of its strategies and solid guest demand, with the latter gaining from exciting brand launches.Also, increased in-person activities and travel have been leading to the revival of the beauty category demand. All major categories delivered double-digit comp sales growth. Encouragingly, Ulta Beauty raised its fiscal 2022 view.Ulta Beauty has an expected earnings growth rate of 2% for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.6% over the last 30 days.Carlisle Companies Inc. is set to gain from strength in the U.S. reroofing end markets besides its acquired assets. Strength in the medical technologies business and the commercial aerospace business is likely to drive CSL's performance.Strength in the reroofing market in the United States and growth in the architectural metals platform will likely benefit its CCM segment. Carlisle expects the segment's 2022 revenues to jump about 40% on a year-over-year basis. CSL's focus on product launches and the growing backlog will likely benefit it.Carlisle Companies has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

346,f11cc564-8e46-34f6-8f54-2b08071b36b0,NSC,2022-09-28,Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Norfolk Southern Corporation's (NYSE:NSC) recent 9.0% drop adds to one-year losses,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-owners-may-dramatic-actions-155106215.html,1664293866,STORY,['NSC'],"[A look at the shareholders of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 75% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$5.0b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 11% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Norfolk Southern's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Norfolk Southern. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norfolk Southern?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Norfolk Southern does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Norfolk Southern's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Norfolk Southern. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.0% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 5.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Norfolk SouthernThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Norfolk Southern Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$60m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in Norfolk Southern. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

347,9456b9c7-7496-389c-996b-dae0d5e92430,KO,2022-09-28,Risks To Shareholder Returns Are Elevated At These Prices For The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risks-shareholder-returns-elevated-prices-140049933.html,1664287249,STORY,['KO'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 26.1x The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 7x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Coca-Cola as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Coca-Cola will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Coca-Cola's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Coca-Cola would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 18% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 34% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.7% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's curious that Coca-Cola's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.What We Can Learn From Coca-Cola's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Coca-Cola currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that you should be aware of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Coca-Cola. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

349,8a2969e0-b757-35b9-b0bf-716bf77da5ba,KO,2022-09-28,CocaCola Company The (KO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-trending-stock-130001383.html,1664283601,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned -7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.7% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has lost 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.59 indicates a change of +5% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $10.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.8%. The $42.42 billion and $43.73 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.8% and +3.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $11.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $0.70 for the same period compares with $0.68 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.26%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

350,5d8e4c57-6f62-30ac-9c65-77984b059684,INCY,2022-09-28,Incyte Corporation's (NASDAQ:INCY) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-corporations-nasdaq-incy-stock-153113302.html,1664292673,STORY,['INCY'],"[Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) has had a rough three months with its share price down 12%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Incyte's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Incyte How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Incyte is:23% = US$945m ÷ US$4.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Incyte's Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Incyte has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, a comparison with the average industry ROE of 23% also portrays the company's ROE in a good light. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 50% net income growth seen by Incyte was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesWe then compared Incyte's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Incyte is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Incyte Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Given that Incyte doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Incyte's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

QuickBooks Online Advanced addresses this problem head on by making core business functions easier, quicker, and safer. These exciting new features include capabilities such as customised reports, sensitive data controls and data restoration.Nick Williams, UK Product Director at Intuit QuickBooks says: ""Small businesses have had a challenging time of it over the pandemic, and now the cost-of-living crisis is continuing to pile on the pressure. Many of these businesses require support from professionals to help their back-office run smoothly – and those best positioned to help are accountancy professionals. An accountant can help small business owners to streamline their finances and improve their back-office processes, and allow them to refocus on running the business itself. By expanding and developing new features in QB Advanced, we're proud to be able to continue backing these accounting professionals to keep supporting the small business community.""QuickBooks Online Advanced boasts all the features of Intuit's most popular small business software solution, QuickBooks Online Plus, as well as enhanced services to make it the perfect fit for growing business owners. With expanding lists of employees, customers and suppliers, business growth is often accompanied by an abundance of complex challenges. Advanced has been designed to ease these emerging pain points through easy to use, intuitive and modern features.Story continuesA few key features:Custom performance tracking : With Performance Centre, users can track the metrics  they care about most with custom charts, dashboards, and layouts. Users can also add and compare metrics to understand how they're growing. Having the metrics clients care about close to hand means greater client satisfaction.Save all your work: Ensure there is a backup of the company with a copy in real time to revert back to. The Backup &amp; Restore feature enables  automatic and continuous backups; especially useful when clients make mistakes, you can steer them back to clean books. Advanced does this by taking snapshots at different points in the day, giving users moments in time to go back to.Uncover  powerful insights with improved reports and categorisation: Accounting professionals can help their clients  build powerful reports from scratch rather than customising existing templates, giving them more flexibility with how they visualise and present reports. Additionally, customers can use enhanced custom fields to add 12 fields per transaction  – allowing customers to categorise and analyse their transactions more granularly. Put the right information into the right hands: Using the Custom Roles feature, customers can control who can and can't see sensitive data. This allows for an in-house accounting function to create a segregation of duties, limiting the amount of access to internal payroll administrators and bookkeepers. This can provide greater internal controls and lower the possibility of errors.Automate accounting tasks and approval flows: Set reminders for transactions with a due date, like invoices, payments, or deposits with the Workflows feature. Business owners can notify customers when they receive their payment, plus send bills and invoices through pre-set approval flows.Additional product capabilities will be added to the platform in the near future — providing accounting professionals  even greater benefits to anticipate including features to increase administrative and reporting efficiencies for their clients.Johann Goree, Group Managing Director at OnPoint Accounting Group says: ""We're passionate about putting digital at the heart of our work with our small business clients, and the new features in the QuickBooks Advanced product are already allowing us to continue to go above and beyond for those who have been hit by the challenges of the last few years.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) share price is up 63% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 38% (ignoring dividends).Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for VeriSign While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, VeriSign managed to grow its earnings per share at 11% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that VeriSign has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that VeriSign shares lost 19% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 10% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  VeriSign is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...Story continuesOf course VeriSign may not be the best stock to buy.

363,a60c24f8-29ff-39b7-b342-6ebe9db31e03,GE,2022-09-28,Insiders who placed huge bets on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) earlier this year would be disappointed with the 3.2% drop,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-placed-huge-bets-general-120120794.html,1664366480,STORY,['GE'],"[The recent 3.2% drop in General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) stock could come as a blow to insiders who purchased US$5.7m worth of stock at an average buy price of US$75.36 over the past 12 months. Insiders invest with the hopes of seeing their money grow in value over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$4.9m, which is not what they expected.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$64.47. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. Generally speaking, it catches our eye when insiders have purchased shares at above current prices, as it suggests they believed the shares were worth buying, even at a higher price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$5.7m for 75.54k shares. But insiders sold 1.44k shares worth US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeGeneral Electric is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$172m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Electric Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like General Electric insiders think the business has merit.

Continued recovery in the commercial market bodes well for the Aerospace unit. Robust consumer demand is driving orders in the segment. Significant growth in commercial services and continued strength in spare parts sales are boosting segmental revenues. The Healthcare segment is benefiting from Imaging, Ultrasound and HTS services sales. Strong order demand in the Healthcare segment is expected to continue to drive revenues. The company expects mid-single digit revenue growth in the Healthcare segment for the full year.Despite the impact of supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, GE’s bottom line is supported by cost-control measures and pricing actions. The company’s bottom line jumped 95% year over year in the second quarter of 2022 on a 2% increase in sales.General Electric’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In March 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized the share repurchase program of up to $3 billion. GE bought back approximately 4.6 million shares for $0.3 billion in the second quarter under this authorization. In the first quarter, the company paid out dividends worth $140 million to shareholders compared with $148 million in the year-ago period.General Electric Company Price and ConsensusGeneral Electric Company Price and ConsensusGeneral Electric Company price-consensus-chart | General Electric Company QuoteGeneral Electric’s focus on strategically acquiring businesses while simultaneously divesting non-core operations should fuel its growth. In January 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Opus One Solutions Energy Corporation. The Opus One buyout enhances GE Digital’s capabilities to support the use of renewable and distributed energy resources.GE Healthcare’s buyout of Zionexa in May 2021, the Transformer Solutions business of SPX Corporation in October 2021 and General Electric’s acquisition of BK Medical in December 2021 are worth mentioning. The company divested the GE Capital Aviation Services business in November 2021, the lighting business in July 2020, the BioPharma business in March 2020 and GE Transportation in February 2019. Benefits from restructuring initiatives are aiding the company’s bottom line.General Electric announced that it would split its businesses into three independent companies, comprising GE Healthcare (to be completed in early 2023), GE Aviation, and the combined operations of GE Digital, Renewable Energy, and GE Power (to be completed in early 2024). The separation has been structured as tax-free spin-offs and is intended to strengthen the operating performance and the financial position. General Electric will operate as an aviation-focused company starting in early 2024.In light of the abovementioned positives, we believe investors should hold on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock now. Gradual easing of supply-chain constraints and continued expansion in manufacturing activities place General Electric well for future growth.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks within the Conglomerates sector are as follows:Carlisle Companies CSL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

367,77039a8e-5baf-32ef-9069-44a519cc3be3,GE,2022-09-28,Is Trending Stock General Electric Company (GE) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-general-electric-company-130001100.html,1664283601,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (GE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this industrial conglomerate have returned -15.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which GE falls in, has lost 10.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, GE is expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, indicating a change of -10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.46 indicates a change of +62.8% from what GE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GE.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For GE, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $75.89 billion and $81.4 billion estimates indicate +2.4% and +7.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGE reported revenues of $18.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2%. EPS of $0.78 for the same period compares with $0.40 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.59%. The EPS surprise was +105.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.GE is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

View our latest analysis for Progressive How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.4% = US$852m ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.4% ROEOn the face of it, Progressive's ROE is not much to talk about. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 11%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Although, we can see that Progressive saw a modest net income growth of 14% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing Progressive's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is PGR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Progressive Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 49% (implying that the company retains 51% of its profits), it seems that Progressive is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Progressive is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 50%. Still, forecasts suggest that Progressive's future ROE will rise to 22% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Progressive has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Initially inked for five years, the contract can be renewed twice for one year each.The latest contract win allows the Centene unit to work closely with its chain of local providers and community partners in Nebraska and extend cutting-edge solutions at affordable costs. The solutions are meant to improve health outcomes for the state’s Medicaid members, who are part of Heritage Health, the Medicaid Managed Care Program of Nebraska. The program makes physical health, behavioral health, pharmacy, hospital, dental and other services accessible to the state’s Medicaid community.The Nebraska subsidiary of Centene has successfully established its solid statewide footing since it began serving Nebraskans in 2017, thanks to its well-performing Medicaid business. The strength of its Medicaid expertise is reflected via similar contract wins, including the latest one. As a testament to its fortified base across Nebraska, the CNC unit caters to more than 125,000 Medicaid enrollees and collaborates with around 60,000 healthcare providers of the state.The current year has been quite an active year so far for CNC with respect to contract wins. In the ongoing month of September, along with the Nebraska contract win, CNC’s Texas arm Superior HealthPlan struck a deal to continue catering to the state’s foster children and youth via its Medicaid program. Some other states having chosen the managed care organization this year are Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri.Partnerships with healthcare providers of a particular region offer Centene an insight into the diversified needs of the local members and their families. In addition, CNC’s continuous efforts to boost provider collaborations and extend value-based care through its Medicaid business, led the business to conquer a significant share of the Medicaid market in the United States. As CNC continues to leverage the Medicaid business to penetrate more states, its customer base is expected to grow simultaneously.Story continuesMembership growth usually sounds good for a health insurer like CNC since premiums derived from its health insurance plans contribute a chunk to the top line. As of Jun 30, 2022, Centene’s Medicaid membership improved 10.1% year over year.Regarding the Nebraska contract win, apart from Centene, two other managed care organizations chosen by the state authority, include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH and Molina Healthcare, Inc.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on UnitedHealth Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$25b ÷ (US$230b - US$89b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 10% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for UnitedHealth Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 75% more capital into its operations. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On UnitedHealth Group's ROCETo sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 177% return to those who've held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.UnitedHealth Group does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group  that you might be interested in.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Enter ""Scent Styling,"" the freshest new design concept from the fragrance experts at Febreze that marries the sense of smell with the visual art of interior design to elevate your living space. Studies have shown that smell – both good and bad – can have a profound impact on your mental and physical wellbeing. By thoughtfully incorporating scents throughout your home, you can curate an atmosphere for every room.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220928005284/en/Febreze partners with actress, TV personality, and home decor designer Garcelle Beauvais to help introduce its new fresh new design concept ""Scent Styling."" (Photo: Business Wire)Febreze partnered with actress, author, and home décor designer Garcelle Beauvais to share how you can Scent Style your home with Febreze AIR. With Garcelle’s expertise and over thirty Febreze AIR fragrance options, it’s easy to find the perfect scents to elevate any room in your home and enhance your everyday experience.""When styling a room, we focus primarily on visual aesthetics, while smell is often overlooked. But interior designers know the power that smell can have in a home – there’s a reason realtors use smells as a finishing touch!"" says Beauvais. ""To help create the ambiance I’m looking for, Febreze AIR is a must-have. Just a few sprays fight those bad odors and leave the luxurious, fresh scents I want behind. Remember home cohesion doesn’t stop with the eyes – with Scent Styling, you’ll love what you see and smell throughout your home.""Story continuesIndeed, though underutilized, scent is a powerful tool in interior design. A new scent-focused study1 from the Fragrance Creators Association published in Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications demonstrates that smell fundamentally underpins most experiences of daily life such as memory, wellbeing, motivated behavior, social behavior, and emotions. Pleasant scents can enhance a space by improving mood, relieving anxiety, increasing alertness, or even providing a comforting sense of nostalgia. One of the authors, Morgan Eberhard (formerly Morgan Brashear), Senior Scientist at Febreze, adds, ""The research reveals how bad smells can equally impact a space in a negative way. So, no matter how beautifully decorated or satisfyingly organized a room may be, the design isn’t complete until the sense of smell is addressed.""So how does Scent Styling work? Here are a few key things to consider when deciding how to elevate every room in your home:STEP 1Think about the room and how it’s used.Which room in your house needs a pick-me-up? What do you most commonly do in that room, or what do you want to be doing in that room? Does this activity create odors? You’ll want a different vibe in a room where you’ll zen out and meditate than a room where you’ll watch football with guests.STEP 2Consider the visual aesthetic and the overall mood.All the elements of your room should feel cohesive - and that includes the way it smells, too. Do you go for the clean, minimal lines of modern design? Or do you prefer the carefree, multi-textured style of Bohemian? Think about how different scents will feel with different looks. Farmhouse, for example, works well with fragrances with natural notes, while industrial is better-suited with cleaner, masculine aromas.STEP 3Follow your nose to your favorite fragrances.Think about your scent aesthetic. Do you gravitate towards clean, refreshing scents? Floral or fruity? And which of these fragrances will deliver on the ambiance you want to create?This easy approach will help you identify the best Scent Style for that space and build out the fragrance blueprint for your entire home room by room.

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $75 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for The Procter &amp; Gamble shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, The Procter &amp; Gamble is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Soap and Cleaning Materials industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.61 per share to $1.57 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about The Procter &amp; Gamble right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Sometimes they will react to what we're doing,"" Hayes finally said.JetBlue's proposed deal for Spirit is expected to face a tough antitrust review. Hayes defended the acquisition from the witness stand, saying it would create ""one of the most powerful, disruptive forces that this country has seen.""The Justice Department has said that the Northeast Alliance eliminates incentives for American to cut prices to lure customers from JetBlue, a historically disruptive rival with often lower fares. It also gives the airlines a more than 80% market share in flights from Boston to Washington and six other airports.Story continuesIn opening arguments, lawyers for the airlines argued that contrary to the Justice Department's hypothetical claims of harm, the Northeast Alliance has produced significant real-word increases in flights and capacity since its unveiling in 2020.They argued the alliance allowed them to become a viable competitor to dominant Delta Air Lines and United Airlines operating out of Boston and John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports in the New York region.""More output like we're seeing here is highly competitive and leads to lower fares,"" Richard Schwed, JetBlue's lawyer, told U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin.The three-week trial opened after a week in which U.S. judges ruled against the government in two antitrust fights: sugar and insurance.

Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports.The alliance, they will argue, will defang JetBlue, a maverick carrier that often offers better fares than legacy carriers. They will also argue that the alliance gave the two airlines more than 80% market share in flights from Boston to Washington, DC and six other airports.The companies are expected to argue that the alliance is pro-competitive because it allows the companies to better compete with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines by allowing the companies to increase capacity.

Efficient debt management and the ‘Energizing the Future’ plan to expand transmission capability are likely to drive its performance over the long run.However, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to the aging infrastructure can adversely impact profitability. FirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FirstEnergy’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) suggests 5.3% growth from the 2022 estimated figure. Moreover, FE’s current dividend yield of 4% is better than the industry’s average of 3.2%.TailwindsStrategic investments help FirstEnergy serve its six million customers more efficiently. In the past several years, the regulated distribution segment experienced rate base growth through systematic investments.FE expects to invest $17 billion in the 2021-2025 period, of which $8.6 billion will be directed toward grid modernization and increasing resiliency, $1.7 billion for conservation and $6.5 billion for a clean energy transition and customer-centric growth projects. Strengthening transmission assets will allow the company to transmit electricity even during adverse weather conditions.FirstEnergy’s long-term debt and other long-term obligations as of Jun 30, 2022 were $20,763 million, down 6.7% from $22,248 million on Dec 31, 2021. The times interest earned (TIE) ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was 2.4. A TIE greater than one reflects the firm’s ability to meet debt obligations in the near future without difficulties.FirstEnergy is focused on lowering emission levels and has undertaken initiatives for the same. In November 2020, it had updated the target to become 100% carbon neutral by 2050, with a mid-term goal of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gases within direct operational control by 2030 from the 2019 level. Also, it plans to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2030 and further 100% by 2050.Story continuesHeadwindsAlthough FirstEnergy keeps investing in development opportunities to strengthen its transmission operations, the timely completion of projects within budget might not be possible.The existing coal-fired generating plants, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to the aging infrastructure and an adverse impact of severe weather conditions can lower energy deliveries, thereby impacting operating and financial results.

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, for US$6.0m worth of shares, at about US$161 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$166). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 20% of Hugh Johnston's stake.In the last year PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At PepsiCo Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at PepsiCo. In total, insiders sold US$900k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PepsiCoI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. PepsiCo insiders own about US$318m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The PepsiCo Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that PepsiCo is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo. While conducting our analysis, we found that PepsiCo has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PepsiCo PEP, Lancaster Colony LANC, Chesapeake Utilities CPK, NextEra Energy NEE and Otter Tail OTTR.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Play It Safe as Market Volatility Climbs on Rate Hike: 5 PicksU.S. stocks suffered losses for yet another week that ended Sep 23 as an increase in interest rates heightened fears of a recession. All the three major benchmarks tumbled on Friday, with the Dow closing below the coveted 30,000-mark for the first time since Jun 17. The blue-chip index was flirting with bear market territory and had dropped 4% for the week, while the broader S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively, per the Dow Jones Market Data.In fact, the major indexes have now registered their fifth negative week out of the last six-week period. On the other hand, Wall Street's fear gauge touched its highest levels in months. In the last trading session, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) soared above 30 for the first time since Jun 21, indicating that wild intraday gyrations are here to stay. After all, VIX has been known for tracking implied volatility in the upcoming 30-day trading period.Nonetheless, fears that Fed's inflation fight may lead to a possible recession in the near future were primarily responsible for such a brutal bout of selling in recent times. This is because the Fed's aggressive tightening measures to tame high inflation may significantly hamper consumer outlays, increase the cost of borrowing and hold up economic growth.The central bank, recently, increased its benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points for the third straight time to the 3-3.25% range, the highest federal funds rate since early 2008. The Fed has further vowed to hike interest rates to drag down inflation to its target of 2% at best by 2025. Talking about inflation, gas prices have dipped. However, prices of food, housing, rent and vehicles have continued to jack up with little relief in sight (Read More: Big Fed Rate Hike a Boon for These 5 Bank Stocks).Story continuesFrom an investment perspective though, investors shouldn't completely shun equities!

Given that the average selling price of US$639 is still lower than the current share price, insiders would probably have been better off keeping their shares.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, George Sing, for US$7.0m worth of shares, at about US$660 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$686, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 23% of George Sing's stake.In the last year Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Specifically, Independent Director Arthur Ryan ditched US$4.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Regeneron PharmaceuticalsLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own about US$3.1b worth of shares (which is 4.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

However, escalated operating expenses are hurting its bottom line.Factors Favoring UNPUnion Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders please us. UNP hiked dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP further upped its quarterly dividend by 10%. The railroad operator is also active on the buyback front. In the first half of 2022, UNP returned $5 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Management anticipates share repurchases for 2022 to be in line with the 2021 levels. Additionally, UNP expects a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings) in the long term.The upbeat free cash flow generation supports the shareholder-friendly activities of this railroad operator, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Free cash flow increased 8.8% to $3,523 million in 2021. UNP generated $4.2 billion cash from operations in first-half 2022.The bullish commentary by management on volumes at the Deutsche Bank Transportation Conference for the third quarter of 2022 is a huge positive. At the presentation, management stated that overall volumes for the third quarter were up 2% year over year as of Aug 11, 2022. This improvement was owing to the easing of labor problems and congestion-related headwinds.Per UNP CFO Jennifer Hamann, ""We're encouraged by the improvement seen in fluidity and crew availability and have begun to place some stored cars back into service."" UNP expects volume growth to be stronger in the second half of 2022 than in the first half. Management expects 2022 volumes (carloads) to grow in the 4-5% band.Key RisksIncreased fuel costs due to higher oil prices are limiting bottom-line growth. In 2021, fuel expenses increased 56% year over year to $2,049 million at Union Pacific. In first-half 2022, fuel expenses escalated 82%, inducing a 20% increase in operating costs. Higher fuel price hurt the operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) to the tune of 130 basis points in the June quarter.Story continuesTepid automotive freight revenues are bothering. Even though the automotive unit is on the mend, the overall situation is worrisome. On the second-quarter 2022 conference call, management admitted that its ""dealer inventory is still low at 25 days"".UNP’s high debt/EBITDA ratio is concerning as well. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a company is unable to service its debt appropriately. Supply-chain woes are a worry as well.Shares of UNP have declined 20.3% year to date compared with its  industry’s 19.1% decrease.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  Transportation   sector are Triton International  TRTN and  C.H. Robinson  CHRW .Triton is being aided by the gradual increase in trade volumes and container demand. TRTN expects container demand to remain strong throughout 2022. Measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks instill confidence in the stock.Triton has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.4% for the current year.

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.Meet PowerWells, a startup based out of Australia that won a $75,000 USD Regional First Runner-Up Prize in the Asia Pacific, Japan and China (APJC) region. Their solution addresses the dual global problems of electronic waste management and lack of access to basic electricity.I sat down with Bradley Clair, one of the co-founders of PowerWells, who is passionate about the intersection of electronic waste recycling and energy poverty solutions. He shared more about how PowerWells is diverting batteries from landfills and how they are helping people make the switch from kerosene to clean energy.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Brad: PowerWells is trying to solve the dual problems of energy poverty and electronic waste globally. We want to replace people's reliance on kerosene lanterns, which is terrible for the environment and your health. A family sitting around a little kerosene lamp is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day. At the same time, in Australia, only about 2 percent of lithium-ion batteries are currently being recycled or repurposed. Ninety-eight percent of those batteries are potentially ending up in landfills. There's still so much life in those discarded batteries which can be transformed into sustainable forms of energy for people who don't have access to a traditional electric grid.Story continuesWe recycle lithium-ion laptop batteries by pulling them apart and testing them. We get the good cells that are working, and then we use those cells to build bigger packs. We also use TV and computer screens, and we use the Perspex (a type of acrylic) inside of that and put that into the laser cutter to build the battery enclosure. We essentially created a small-scale solar system that we can put into places that don't have access to electricity so that people can charge their phones and have light.At Substation33, the electronic waste recycling facility we partner with, we probably processed over 10 tons of lithium-ion batteries. Of that 10 tons of lithium-ion batteries, about 80 percent of those batteries are still okay to use. So, that means from the 98 percent of batteries potentially going into landfills, 80 percent of them are usable. And instead of allowing these batteries to end up in landfills, we might as well use them to provide power to people without access to electricity.Can you explain how the solution works?Brad: What usually happens is we'll have a whole heap of discarded computers here at Substation. Then we'll have people pulling apart the computers and sorting out the different components. One of the components is the battery. Our team will test all the cells, and these types of batteries are similar to AA batteries. There are about six of these AA batteries in these laptop batteries. So, we'll have people testing all these cells, and it's usually only one of the cells that are dead, but you can't use the battery anymore when that happens.So, we get the good cells that are working, and then they test all the cells that still work to determine if they are any good. We grade our batteries, and the grade helps us determine the application. If it is a great battery, we'll put that into our power system, and if it's not a good battery, we'll put it into something else.After the batteries have been tested, soldered, and the Perspex enclosure assembled, we solder the circuit board, which is designed here at Substation33. The smart thing about the circuit board is that it reduces the capacity of the cell to extend its life, so we don't fully charge or discharge the battery. We're only using about 50 percent of the battery capacity, and in doing so, you extend the lifetime of the cells. So, it's quite different from what many other companies are doing.We can also collect and capture data points like temperature, humidity, and energy going in and out of the system, which gives us insight into how the systems are used and if there are any issues. And from a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perspective, whoever is investing in sponsoring these systems can see the return on their impact.After sending them overseas, there is some final wiring, and they solder the batteries onto the circuit board and put the wrap over systems. They go out to the different villages, and the systems are installed in places that need them. The households that receive the system pay about 5 dollars a month to have access to electricity, and they pay that off over three years. It ends up being about 180 dollars to pay for the systems.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Brad: As far as I'm aware, I think we're one of the only companies that are using electronic waste in this way to provide power to places that don't have access to electricity. Our goal is people and environment first. We want to make our systems easy to manufacture using locally sourced e-waste, and easy to maintain to ensure the longevity of the system and that we do not contribute to the problem we are trying to solve. We have also incorporated Pay As You Go technology, to make it easier for households to pay off our systems, and we capture telemetry displayed via an online dashboard to visually demonstrate the impact of our systems.What inspired you to develop this solution?Brad: During a startup weekend at Substation33, we were asked to solve a social or environmental problem. We had a group member from West Papua, Indonesia, and he grew up in a village that didn't have any access to electricity. His parents still live there, and they don't have any power. So, we decided to tackle energy poverty, using our experience working with repurposed batteries. We made a battery, put it into a paint bucket, hooked a solar panel up to it, and put some USB charging ports on it. One of the judges asked us if we wanted to go ahead and do it, and two weeks later, we raised a few thousand dollars.We flew over to Jakarta to test all the assumptions that we came up with during the startup weekend to see if it was something that would be worthwhile. We installed our prototype in a small village without power, and as soon as we put it in there, all the kids grabbed their smartphones and tablets that were completely dead and started charging their devices. We tested all our assumptions within a few weeks of coming up with the idea. We were inspired to start the business because we realized there was a need for it, and it was also possible.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Brad: Cisco's funds will help propel us forward; it gives us an opportunity to go from pilot project to scale. We want to create more scalable processes, local manufacturing, training and employment opportunities for local teams on the ground. This prize gives us a great platform to reach out to other organizations and solar distributors, who would benefit from learning how to repurpose electronic waste to provide energy to people in need.Do you know what you will use the prize money for specifically?Brad: Due to COVID, we couldn't travel overseas to meet new partners, and set up manufacturing in Indonesia. We want to use this money to begin the process with our partners Sumba Sustainable Solutions, who are currently distributing our systems. We are also thinking about the rise of electric vehicles (EV) and would like to put some of that money into developing our next product, which incorporates used EV batteries.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Brad: It's a tough journey. You've got to be willing to stick to it, even when you aren't getting a lot in return. But it's amazing when companies like Cisco back organizations like ours because it means so much, considering the amount of effort and time you put into it.
